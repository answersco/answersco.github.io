title: "Resolution"
---
spatial (tells two things apart) temporal (fluro)
MTF describes it
focal spot, amount of mag, detector resolution, pt motion, processing

-smaller aperture in the z axis leads to improved resolution (less mag and smaller focal spot as well)
-better w increased # of projections and rays per projection
-better w thinner slices and reconstructed slices
-reconstruction algorithm: higher spatial frequency (bone)
- smaller pixel size
- SSP 
- Motion- pt

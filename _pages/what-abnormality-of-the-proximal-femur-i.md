title: "What abnormality of the proximal femur is associated with DDH?"
---
Answer: coxa magna
Coxa magna: represents a broadened femoral head with a short and wide femoral neck. Seen in DDH.
-Results in femoral shortening- leads to prxoimal displacement of the greater and lesser trochanters.

Acetabulum: least severe change is upturning of the lateral acetabular roof.
-Most severe change is lack of formation of the acetabulum with the femoral head, forming a pseudoarticulation with the iliac bone.
-Acetabulum is retroverted in 37%.

DDH bilateral in 20%.

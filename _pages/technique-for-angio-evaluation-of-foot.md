title: "Technique for angio evaluation of foot"
---
When pathology is present in the foot, dedicated views are necessary. A single lateral view that includes the malleolus to the toes is usually sufficient, though AP may be needed for specific indications
-Positioning catheter tip in EIA or SFA maximizes delivery of contrast to the foot
-Extreme plantar flexion of the foot should be avoided to prevent artifactual occlusion of the DP artery.
-In the presence of extensive proximal occlusive disease, it is important to use reactive hyperemia, prolonged image acquisition, and injection of of full-strength low-osmolar contrast at 5 mL/sec for 4-6 seconds.

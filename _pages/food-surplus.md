title: "Food surplus"
---
Pastoralism and agriculture led to greater and more reliable levels of food production and ultimately food surpluses. Surpluses freed some peopel from the task of food production, allowing them to take on specialized jobs such as artisan or warrior. In time, this division of labor contributed to the development of hierarchal social organization.

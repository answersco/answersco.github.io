title: "How can retinoblastoma, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous, and Coat disease be distinguished by imaging?"
---
PHPV is the most common intraocular abnormality to be confused with retinoblastoma. PHPV rarely calcifies on CT unlike retinoblastoma. Also, unlike retinoblastoma, the vitreous is hyperdense on CT or hyperintense (on T1 and T2 MR), and the globe is small.

Coat disease is an exudative retinopathy with detachments. There are no calcifications (unlike retinoblastoma), and the globe is typically hyperintense on T1WI and T2WI MR.
Coat disease is also less likely to have restricted diffusion than retinoblastoma

Retinoblastoma: 
Hypointense relative to vitreous on T2WI&#8594; Helps distinguish from other congenital lesions
Moderate to marked heterogeneous enhancement

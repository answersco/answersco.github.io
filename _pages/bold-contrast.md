title: "BOLD Contrast"
---
Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast- used in fMRI 
When the brain is imaged using MR acquisitions sensitive to differences in local magnetic field (T2*-weighted) &#8594; the resultant signal is &#8593; regions with higher concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin
It is necessary to have a conditional contrast (e.g. task vs rest) to detect the BOLD signal changes.
In resting-state fMRI (RSfMRI): Low-frequency (&lt;0.1 Hz) BOLD fluctuations&#8594; may show strong correlations at rest in brain networks that would operate together during the performance of a task.

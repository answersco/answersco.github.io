title: "Beta Plus (Positron)"

This is PET, you're giving off a positive to become more negative or neutral
In this scenario, the proton gives away its positive charge as a POSITRON (requires 1.02MeV) 
Positron then annihilates with an electron and gives off TWO photons at 511 KeV which are great for imaging

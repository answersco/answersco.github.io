Celiac-SMA anastomoses
Arc of Buhler: uncommon short-segment direct connection between celiac artery and SMA: persistent embryologic remnant, not an acquired pathway
Inferior pancreaticoduodenal (1st SMA branch) &#8594; forms a rich collateral network with celiac about the pancreatic head, called the pancreatic cascade
Arc of Barkow: connects the SMA to the celiac axis via the right and left epiploic arteries

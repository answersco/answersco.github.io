Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis (DISH)

It is DISTINCT from DDD/OA, but it APPEARS SIMILAR to it d/t osteophyte formation

DISH is defined as flowing bridging anterior osteophytes (this is why it LOOKS like OA - but it isn't) spanning AT LEAST FOUR VERTEBRAL LEVELS, with normal disk spaces and sacroiliac joints

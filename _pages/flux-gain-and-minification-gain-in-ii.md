title: "Flux gain and minification gain in II"
---
Flux gain: describes the increase in magnitude of light coming from output phosphor relative to input.
Accomplished by using a high voltage difference between the photocathode and the output phosphor (25-35 kV) 
Uses focusing electrodes.
The voltage causes electrons to accelerate &#8594; yields gain of energy

Minification gain: electrons from the large photocathode surface are concentrated on a small output phosphor.
This &#8593; the # of electrons per unit area&#8594; &#8593; energy per unit area
Mag mode: decreases minification.

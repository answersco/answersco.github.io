title: "M.T.S."
---
post-reform rape case in New Jersey, which requires use of physical force; Court says penetration IS the force, effectively eliminating force requirement (by making it the sex itself); legislative intent was to engage in rape reform, so interpreting otherwise reintroduces a resistance requirement not intended; AFFIRMATIVE consent jurisdiction (empty record = defendant GUILTY); force case (not a mens rea case)

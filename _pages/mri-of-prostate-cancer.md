Prostate cancer: typical appearance is a T2-hypointense mass within the T2-hyperintense peripheral zone
Pitfalls:
MRI may not detect all prostate cancer (limited sensitivity)
Some cancer is not hypointense on T2W images
Central cancers are difficult to detect on T2W images
Cancer conspicuity is &#8595; if the peripheral zone is not T2-hyperintense
MRI also has limited specificity: 
Other causes of a region of peripheral zone T2 hypointensity include prostatitis, hemorrhage, and involutional changes from androgen-deprivation therapy
Advanced techniques to increase specificity:
MRI spectroscopy: may show &#8593; choline and &#8595; citrate peaks in cancer compared to normal prostate
Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI: typically shows prostate cancer to have early enhancement relative to the peripheral zone
Diffusion imaging: cancer typically shows restricted diffusion

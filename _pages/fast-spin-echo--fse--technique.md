The RF excitation pulse is followed by a &quot;train&quot; of refocusing pulses.
A &quot;train&quot; of echoes occurs&#8594; each echo fills one row of k-space (# of lines = # of echoes)
Total scan time &#8595; by the echo train length.
During echo-train collection, the transverse magnetic signal gradually &#8595; for each line of the echo-train (T2-blurring)
&#8594; T2-blurring alters the T2 weighting and &#8595; the sharpness of the image
Phase rewinding gradients&#8594; rephase the transverse magnetization &#8594; makes the transverse magnetization more consistent between phase-encode steps and minimizes artifacts.

title: "What accounts for most x-ray production?"
---
Bremsstrahlung (radiative losses): account for 80% of x-rays produced
Amount of Bremsstrahlung interaction is proportional to energy of the incoming charged particle and the atomic # Z of the absorber
Higher Z = more Bremsstrahlung
NM: low-Z materials (plastic) are used to shield beta-emitters (e.g. Y-90) in order to minimize bremsstrahlung production (would increase with lead)

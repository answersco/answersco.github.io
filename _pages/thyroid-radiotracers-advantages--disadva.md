I-123, I-131, and Tc-99m all get trapped by thyroid
Only I-123 and I-131 undergo organification

I-131: very cheap
Disadvantage: long half-life (8 days) and high-energy (364 keV) beta emitter, which makes a crappy image.
-Ideal for therapy, not for routine imaging
-Contraindicated in kids and pregnant women

I-123: shorter half-life (13 hours)
-Ideal energy (159 keV) for imaging
-Decays by electron capture and makes prettier images
-More expensive

Tc-99m: trapped but not organified.
-Higher background levels because only 1-5% is taken up by thyroid
-Chosen over iodine in setting of recent thyroid blocker (such as iodinated contrast).

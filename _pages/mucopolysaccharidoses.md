Key XR findings include:
Anterior vertebral body beaking
Thickened ribs
Undertubulated bones
Madelung deformity of wrists (wedge-shaped proximal carpal row with radius shifted toward ulna)
Thickened calvarium with J-shaped sella
Hurlers&#8594; anterior beaking of vertebral bodies, primarily inferiorly
Morquio&#8594; anterior beaking of middle portion of vertebral body (Morquio = middle)
Associated with spinal stenosis and atlantoaxial instability.

Hunters/Hurlers/Morquio
Oval shaped vertebral bodies with anterior beaking
Clavicles and ribs are often thick (narrow more medially) kind of like canoe paddles
Hand xray is most commonly shown finding with wide metacarpal bones with proximal tapering (image)

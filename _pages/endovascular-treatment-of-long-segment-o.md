title: "Endovascular treatment of long-segment occlusions"
---
Long occlusions can be treated either through the native lumen or with subintimal angioplasty

Drug-eluting stents (DES) hold promise for use in long-segment recanalization of SFA and popliteal artery, and for below-knee interventions.

When fresh-appearing thrombus is present in an occlusion, a short trial of catheter-directed thrombolysis may convert it to a stenosis and decrease risk of distal embolization.

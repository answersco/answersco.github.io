title: "True LV aneurysm versus false aneurysm (pseudoaneurysm):"
---
True LV aneurysm: focal outpouching of the ventricular wall, involving all layers of the muscular wall.
Associated with occlusion of the LAD.
Most common location: along the anterolateral or apical wall of the LV
XR: may show abnormal contour along the midportion of the left cardiac border near the apex
True aneurysm may calcify
Associated with wall-motion dyskinesia, but rarely rupture.
Management is medical.

False aneurysm (pseudoaneurysm): contained ventricular rupture, with only pericardial adhesions preventing a complete rupture.
There is no myocardium in the wall of a false aneurysm.
Associated with occlusion of the LCX or RCA.
Most common location is the upper diaphragmatic and posterior wall.
XR: may show retrocardiac density on frontal image, and abnormal posterior contour on lateral.
May rupture at any time, with increase in size over sequential films worrisome for impending rupture.
Surgical management.

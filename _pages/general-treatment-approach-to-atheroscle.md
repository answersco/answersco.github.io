AS: almost always managed with a stent
FMD: almost always responds to angioplasty alone with excellent long-term results.

-Ostial AS lesions almost always require stent placement, because the stenosis is caused by aortic rather than renal artery plaque. Balloon-expandable stent is often used.
-Typical diameters for renal artery ostia are 5-7 mm; stent lengths usually 1.2-2 cm.
-The stent should be deployed so that it protrudes into the aorta a few millimeters to ensure adequate displacement of the aortic plaque.
-Proximal renal artery AS lesions (&gt; 1 cm from aortic lumen) respond well to angioplasty alone, but are routinely stented. When the lesions occurs at a bifurcation of the renal artery, kissing balloons or stents may be necessary. Drug-eluting stents can be used when treating smaller &gt;3.5 mm) renal arteries such as accessory or segmental arteries. 

-In FMD, restenosis occurs in up to 20%, and should be managed by repeat angioplasty.

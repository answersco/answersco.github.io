title: "Treatment of venous stenosis and thrombosis of surgical dialysis access:"
---
Venous stenosis of surgical dialysis access: 
Venous outflow stenoses are typically treated with angioplasty&#8594; often require high-pressure or cutting balloons to dilate the fibrotic lesions.
Goal: restore palpable thrill and pulse, or to restore the venous to brachial artery pressure ratio to &lt; 0.4

Thrombosis of surgical dialysis access: can occur in AVF or PTFE graft
Graft thrombosis is simpler to declot than AVF because thrombus is limited to graft
Thrombosis is often secondary to venous stenosis, which must be treated as well
Mechanical and/or pharmacologic thrombolysis can be performed.

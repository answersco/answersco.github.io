title: "CXR: 1) &quot;figure 3&quot; (pre and post stenotic dilitation) 2) bilateral rib notching (must involve middle or lateral aspects, only medial rib can be normal variant) secondary to dilated intercostal artery (4th-8th ribs)- unilateral if proximal to L subclav 3) prominent ascending aorta 4)LVH 5) lateral: filling in retrosternal clear space from dilated ascending aorta 6) lateral: wavy densities behind sternum from dilated internal mammaries Esophogram: &quot;reverse figure 3&quot; CTA/MRA/Angio: 1) focal aortic narrowing just beyond origin of L subclavian 2) intercostal collaterals (off aorta) 3) may see paraspinal &amp; mesenteric collaterals 4) bicuspid aoric valve 5) infantile form w/ diffuse / long narrowing MRA: 1) used to determine length, relationship to LSC &amp; extent of collaterals 2) phase contrast techniques to measure peak pressure gradients 3) jet distal to coarctation  Ass: 1) bicuspid AV &gt; AS 2) CHD 3) Moyamoya 4) 10% have circle of Willis aneurysms.  Sx: 1) classic form: upper extremity HTN 2) infantile form diffuse form: diffuse type presents eariler w/ CHF, bounding UE pulses, absent LE pulses Tx: resection &amp; anastomosis, angioplasty  PSEUDOCOARCTATION: 1) buckled aorta near ligamentum arteriosum w/ dilitation distal to kinking 2) redundancy of aorta near isthmus 3) &lt; 50% narrowing &amp; not hemodynamically significant (no collaterals, rib notching, or significant pressure gradient - &lt; 30 mmHg) DDx: prominent thoracic collaterals: 1) Coartation 2) SVC obstruction"

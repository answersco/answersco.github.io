title: "2 types of magnification in fluoro"
---
Magnification&#8594; both types increase dose, but geometric mag increases it more

Geometric magnification&#8594; accomplished by bringing the object closer to the x-ray source (Mag = SID/SOD)
Associated increase in dose based on inverse-square law

Electronic magnification (Zoom)
If you &#8595; the FOV by half&#8594; only &#188; of the input phosphor will be irradiated &#8594; &#8595; brightness by &#188; (if other parameters held constant)
Corresponding increase in dose as AEC compensates to maintain brightness at the output phosphor.

Each level of mag increases dose by 1.4-2X

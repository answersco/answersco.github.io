title: "What is most common cause of Colloid shift in Tc99m sulfur colloid scan?"
---
Colloid shift = increased splenic and bone marrow uptake and decreased in liver due to hepatic dysfunction, portal HTN, hypersplenism, or bone marrow activation

Due most commonly to CIRRHOSIS!

(can also be due to diffuse hepatic mets and blunt splenic trauma)

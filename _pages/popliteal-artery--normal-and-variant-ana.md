Continuation of SFA from the adductor canal to the origins of the origins of the tibial vessels below the knee
-Clinically divided into above-knee and below-knee segments.
-Average diameter 4-5 mm
-Supplies knee with superior and inferior (medial and lateral) and middle genicular arteries- take a horizontal course around the knee.
-Supplies posterior calf muscles by the vertically-oriented sural arteries arising from posterior aspect of popliteal artery.
-Normally bifurcates into the anterior tibial and tibioperoneal trunk at the distal edge of the popliteus muscle.
-Most common variant: high origin of one or more of the tibial arteries.

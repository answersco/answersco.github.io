title: "Most common causes of acute renal ischemia"
---
Acute occlusion of a normal main renal artery results in an ischemic kidney that must be revascularized within 30 minutes to preserve substantial function.
Older patients: most commonly due to embolus from cardiac source
Younger patients: usually trauma

Thrombosis of a chronic hemodynamically significant RAS rarely results in immediate loss of kidney due to adequate collateral supply.

Focal areas of abnormal perfusion may be seen in patients with peripheral arterial emboli or main renal artery occlusion with patent accessory arteries.

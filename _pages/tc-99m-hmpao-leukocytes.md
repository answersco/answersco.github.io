Advantages of Tc-99m HMPAO labelled WBCs compared to indium-111:
Shorter half-life of Tc-99m &#8594; allows a higher administered activity, better counts, lower absorbed dose, and ability to perform earlier imaging &#8594; preferred in children usually.
Disadvantages of Tc-99m HMPAO WBCs:
Physiologic uptake in the GI and GU tracts due to unbound Tc-99m-HMPAO complexes&#8594; limits bowel evaluation
Renal activity occurs early, while bowel activity is seen after 1-2 hours.
Delayed imaging is less practical with Tc-99m due to its shorter T1/2

title: "SUV?"
---
(ROI activity*Body weight)/administered activity

based on dose, lean body mass and surface area
-if just use weight and there is a lot of body edema will get falsely high bc less uptake in fat etc. affect comparison SUV

SUV = tissue radioactivity at time point 1 X patient weight / Injected dose activity 
Note: SUV is actually overestimated in fat people: 
1. Fat does not really take up FDG so it truly just distributes into the LEAN MASS compartment (Think about the equation)

Other scenarios where you can get incorrect SUV information:
1. High glucose levels compete w/ F18 so you get LESS uptake
2. Small size of lesion of interest: the size threshold of PET/CT is usually considered to be 1cm. Anything smaller than this is subject to partial volume averaging and therefore will appear to have LESS uptake
3. Iterative reconstruction: the more iterations something undergoes, the higher the SUV

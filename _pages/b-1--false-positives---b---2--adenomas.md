title: "<b>1. False positives:</b>  2. Adenomas of the colon, thyroid, and breast!!  2. Normal uptake:  -Uterus (endometrium) -Ovaries (premenopausal)  -Breasts (diffuse &amp; b/l)  3. Post radiation therapy  4. Granulomatous disease:(sarcoid) Injection granulomas  5. Brown Fat  6. Meformin: -Increased bowel uptake (colon&gt;SB): very intense and diffuse. -this occurs bc metformin increases the GLUT transporters  7. Benign fibroids can also be FDG avid  8. Asymmetric vocal cord uptake: -Focal right vocal cord uptake with paralysis of the left  9. Abscess, post sx draining LN  ------------------ <b>False Negatives:</b>  1. Lung - BAC 2. Multiple Myeloma 3. Neuroendocrine: Carcinoid, pancreas 4. HCC 5. RCC 6. Prostate: well differentiated, acinar 7. Thyroid-some well differentiated cancers that are 131 positive 8. GI mucinous adenoca (colorectal, gastric, pancreatic) 9. Breast: lobular 10. micromets: smaller than twice the FWHM value  --------------- <b>FDG Physiology:</b>  -FDG is taken up into cells via GLUT receptors and then phosphorylated by hexokinase and trapped in the cell as Glucose-6 phosphate  ------------------ <b>Most accurate cancer staging: </b>  *colo-rectal  *Solitary pulmonary nodules *staging for non small cell lung cancers  ----------------- <b>PET Not Recommended for:</b>  1. Staging of the axilla for newly diagnosed <b>breast Cancer</b>  2. Melanoma  ----------------- Protocol: -patient should fast for 4 hours  -inject and then there is an hour or greater resting period prior to scanning  ------------- High Incidence of Malignancy for Incidental Focal FDG uptake:  1. GI Tract: high! 2. Lung 3. Breast: high &gt;50% 4. Thyroid: very high!"

title: "ATN vs. Acute Rejection vs. Cyclosporin toxicity"
---
ATN occurs due to time kidney is not perfused (outside body) and is seen in 1st week. Normal
perfusion but decreased excretion.
Acute rejection occurs from 1 week to 3 months and demonstrates decreased perfusion and
excretion.
Cyclosporin toxicity occurs over the course of months and is not as bad looking as acute rejection
but worse looking than ATN.

title: "What pediatric MSK abnormality is associated with abnormality of Klein's line?"
---
SCFE&#8594; SH I fracture of proximal femoral epiphysis (displaced from metaphysis)
Seen in obese preadolescents (usually 10-16 years), slightly older than those with LCP disease.
Initial findings on AM view can include asymmetric widening of proximal femoral growth plate and lack of intersection of Klein's line with the femoral head.
Klein's line&#8594; drawn along lateral margin of femoral neck, it should intersect femoral head.
Findings best seen on frog-leg lateral, with femoral head displaced medially compared to metaphysis.

title: "ASD types and associations"
---
Secundum is most common (50-70%)
Primum is largest (from endocardial cushion defect) and more likely to be symptomatic. Non amenable to device closure due to proximity to AV valve tissue.
Secundum may close without treatment (Primum, AV canal, and sinus venosus will not).
70% of small VSD will close spontaneously.

CXR: normal if small. Large ASD is nonspecific, with cardiomegaly, increased vasculature, and small aortic knob (same as large VSD).

ASD + hand/thumb defects = Hold Oram
Ostium primum ASD (or endocardial cushion) - Down
Sinus Venosus ASD - PAPVR

title: "What is d-TGA?"
---
Complete transposition of the great vessels. The RA aligns normally to the RV but then aligns to a transposed Ao. The LA aligns normally to LV but aligns with a transposed Pulm Art. There is AV concordance and VA discordance. The systemic and pulmonary circulations are in parallel rather than in series; some connection and mixing between the two circuits is required for survival. This may be an atrial septal communication, a ventricular septal communication or a great artery communication (PDA) or multiple mixing sites.

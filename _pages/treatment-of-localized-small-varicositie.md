Localized small varicosities, telangiectasias, and reticular veins: can be effectively treated with injection of dilute sclerosing agents
-As primary therapy, there is a higher rate of recanalization and retreatment compared to thermal ablation, but cost is lower.
-When GSV or SSV is incompetent, this should be treated first to achieve most durable results with sclerotherapy.
-Small needle used to enter the vein. As soon as flash of blood is seen, sclerosant gently injected.
-Blanching of telangiectasia or reticular vein indicates intravascular injection. 
-Varices should be compressed proximal and distal to injection site to retain sclerosant in target vessel.
-Injection stopped immediately for complaints of pain or obvious local extravasation.
-Local ulceration, pain, and hyperpigmentation can occur, especially with concentrated sclerosants.

Sclerosing agents:
Sodium tetradecyl sulfate
Polidocanol
Sodium morrhuate
Hypertonic saline
Polyiodinated iodine

title: "&quot;To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System&quot;"
---
Institute of Medicine (IOM) initiated the Quality of Healthcare in America project to help produce an improvement in quality over the next 10 years.
&quot;To Err is Human&quot; was the first in a series of reports arising from the project
Projected # of deaths from medical errors exceed those from MVC, breast cancer, or AIDS
Medical errors: defined as the failure of a planned action to be completed or use of the wrong plan to achieve an aim, with highest risk for errors occurring in ICU, OR, or ED.

Report identified several fundamental factors contributing to the errors:
The decentralized nature of the healthcare delivery &quot;nonsystem&quot;
Failure of the licensing systems to focus on errors
The impediment of the liability system to identify errors
The failure of 3rd-party providers to provide financial incentive to improve safety.
Most errors were felt to be system errors rather than individual problems

The report resulted in congressional funding of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which created a list of &quot;never events&quot; to use as the basis of a mandatory reporting system

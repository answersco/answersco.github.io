title: "Flair phenomenon on bone scan: - what is it - when does it occur - how can you tell difference between flair and worsening cancer (2)"
---
- Increased radiotracer uptake from treatment may mimic worsening cancer (both in # and size of lesions) 
- occurs from 2 weeks to 3 months after treatment

How to tell it is flair:
- On plain films the lesions should get more sclerotic
- Should improve after 3 months

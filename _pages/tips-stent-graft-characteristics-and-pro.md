title: "TIPS stent-graft characteristics and proper position"
---
Self-expanding stent-grafts have replaced bare stents.
Viatorr: nitinol-based ePTFE stent graft
-8-12 mm diameter, variable length
-Has a 2 cm portion of bare stent at portal end of device.
-Radiopaque ring demarcates junction between covered and bare portions of endograft.
-Covered portion of stent-graft should extend from entry site in the portal vein to the IVC, reducing late stenosis at the hepatic vein end of the endograft.
-The 2 cm of bare metal should be in portal vein.
-Rule of thumb: measure the PV to IVC distance, and then add 1 cm for desired covered length.

Flat-Panel Detectors (DR)
Faster than conventional film development or CR plate reading
Composed of amorphous (not crystalline) selenium
Photon from x-ray stored as an electric change within a square array of pixels
Information read out by scanning one row at a time with columns read in parallel

Indirect (scintillators) = x-rays &#8594; light &#8594; charge
Direct (photoconductors) = x-rays &#8594; charge

Scintillators vs phosphor
Scintillators have 2-3X more efficiency in x-ray absorption than phosphor at same thickness
Scintillators produce more visible light per x-ray
Scintillators emit a wavelength of light that is a better match for the TFT detector.

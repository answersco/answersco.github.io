- No more than 0.15 microcurie of 99Mo per 1 mCi of Tc99m eluate
- Must measure 99Mo concentration in first eluate after receiving the generator (place eluate behind lead shield and measure penetration of the high energy Mo photons)
- No more than 10 microgram/mL of aluminum ion in Tc 99m eluate (tested with indicator paper)
o Too much aluminum can cause uptake within the liver on a bone scan or uptake within the lungs on a sulfur colloid scan
- The presence of free pertechnetate can be tested with chromatography if indicated

This is making sure that you only have Tc99 and NO mo99 
Regulatory limits is .15 micro Mo / 1 milli curie Tc at time of administration

Testing for Mo breakthrough. You want less than 0.15MICROCi Mo per 1milCi of Tc - at the time of ADMINISTRATION

How much Mo is in the Tc elution? Use a dose calibrator - moly has much higher energy.

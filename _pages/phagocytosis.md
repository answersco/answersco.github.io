title: "Phagocytosis"
---
-includes macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells
-removal of foreign materials (microbes)
-also interacts with the acquired immune system
-steps are:
1) chemotaxis
2) attachment
3) engulfment
4) killing/degradation

-form of endocytosis
1) A phagocytic cell encounters a particle of foreign matter
2) The cell surrounds the particle with its pseudopods
3) The particle is phagocytized and contained in a phagosome
4) The phagosome fuses with a lysosome and become a phagolysosome
5) Enzymes from the lysosome digest the foreign matter
6) The phagolysosome fuses with the plasma membrane
7) The indigestible residue is voided by exocytosis

Use either a single or mixed refrigerant, such as nitrous oxide or argon gas under high pressure
-After gas flows through the cryoapplicator, it expands at the applicator tip, causing temp to rapidly drop, with temps from -80 - -150 C possible.
-Applicators also incorporate helium to cause an active thaw cycle- when helium expands at the tip, heat is rapidly generated.

Usually multiple probes are used to treat larger tumors.
-Length of treatment may vary, but is usually a 10-minute freeze followed by an 8-minute thaw cycle.
-In general, 2 freeze-thaw cycles are used to treat most solid tumors.
-Zone of ablation (freeze ball) can usually be visualized directly with US, CT, or MRI.
-Thermocouple devices monitor local ablation zone temperature.

Margins of frozen tissue on CT do not represent the true margins of tumor necrosis because temperatures at the advancing outer edge of the ice ball are sublethal
-Thus, the visible margin of frozen tissue on imaging is usually extended 5-10 mm beyond the tumor margins seen before the procedure.

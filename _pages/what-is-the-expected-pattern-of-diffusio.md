title: "What is the expected pattern of diffusion restriction for an ex 34-36 week infant with HIE?"
---
The periventricular white matter is most at risk and diffusion restriction would be in the periventricular WM.

Most at risk are the parasagittal watershed regions and the perirolandic (central sulcus) cortex. As duration of hypoxia increases, the basal ganglia and thalami become involved.

title: "Length-tension relationship"
---
-amount of force depends on length of muscle
-optimum length for forming maximum # of crossbridges
EX. bicep curl: when trying to move dumbbell up, less crossbridges are engaged so why it is hard to lift up once you cannot anymore means optimum length was reached

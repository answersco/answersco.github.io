title: "On MUGA scan: - what causes a False Low EF (1) - what causes a False High EF (1)"
---
False low EF:
- screwed up LAO view (overlap of LV with LA or RV great vessels -- counting those counts as the ventricle, so falsely low EF)

False High EF:
- Wrong background ROI
-- cause over subtraction of background and elevate the EF

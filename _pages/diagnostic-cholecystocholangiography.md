title: "Diagnostic cholecystocholangiography"
---
Use only if intrahepatic ducts are minimally dilated and if transhepatic approach fails in patient who only requires a diagnostic study.
-Biliary obstruction must be at a level below the junction of the cystic duct and CHD.
-US-guidance and 22-gauge needle are used.
-If cystic duct is open, CM flows into the CBD and CHD.
-Trendelenburg positioning may be necessary to fill intrahepatic ducts.
-If therapeutic procedures are needed, it is best to use a transhepatic route, because it may be difficult to manipulate stents and catheters through the cystic duct into the CBD.

Thin anterior infolding/indentation of the upper esophogus- usually assymptomatic but can cause dysphagia. Controversial association with anemia (Plummer Vinson) and Carcinoma.

- ring 2/2 thin membrane
-usually near cricopharyngeus (cervical esophagus)
-increased risk of cancer (esophageal &amp; hypopharyngeal CA)
-Plummer-Vinson sx: iron def, dysphagia, thyroid issues, spoon-shaped nails

These things occur in the cervical esophagus and are a thin mucosal membrane
Important facts:
1. Risk factor for hypopharyngeal carcinoma
2. Plummer vinson syndrome: Iron def anemia, dysphagia, thyroid issues, SPOON shaped nails

Generally cervical esophagus near cricopharyngeus. Risk factor for cancer and assoc with Plummer Vinson (iron deficiency anemia, dysphagia, thyroid issues, spoon shaped nails)

-usually near cricopharyngeus (cervical esophagus)
-increased risk of cancer
-Plummer-Vinson sx: iron deficiency

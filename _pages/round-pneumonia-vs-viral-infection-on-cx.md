title: "Round pneumonia vs viral infection on CXR in kids?"
---
1. Viral infection = hyperinflation, peribronchial edema (&quot;busy hilum&quot;), and subsegmental atelectasis

2. Round pneumonia = Strep pneumo; &lt; 8 yo; solitary lesion in superior segment and posterior lower lobes with air bronchograms 
* no good collateral pathways yet in Pores of kohn and canals of lambert, so infection CANNOT SPREAD to involve entire lobe
(See QV 36a 5/11/17)

*DO NOT CONFUSE WITH ROUND ATELECTASIS (infolding of redundant pleura in ADULTS): adjacnet to pleural surface, pleural thicekning, COMET TAIL sign

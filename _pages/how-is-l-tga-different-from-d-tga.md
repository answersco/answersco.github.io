title: "How is L-TGA different from D-TGA?"
---
L-TGA is both AV (atrioventricular) and VA (Ventriculoarterial) discordance whereas D-TGA is AV concordance and VA discordance. L = life where patients survive from infancy. If there is D = death transposition, then without correction (Jatene with Lecompt) then the patient dies in infancy.

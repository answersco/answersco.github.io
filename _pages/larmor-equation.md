title: "Larmor Equation:"
---
Describes the resonant frequency of a nucleus, the precession frequency of a nuclear magnetic moment, and the dependence of resonant frequency on magnetic field strength.
w = yB
w = resonant (and precessional) frequency of nucleus.
y = gyromagnetic ratio (intrinsic, constant property of a nuclear species).
B = magnetic field where nuclear moment is located.
If B varies in space, so does w

Precession frequency = (proton constant) X Bo (magnetic field strength)

w = yB = 42 MHz/T x B
w = precession frequency
y = gyromagnetic ratio (constant) = 42 MHz/T
B = magnetic field strength

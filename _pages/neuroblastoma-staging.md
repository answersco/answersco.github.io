title: "Neuroblastoma staging?"
---
Staging, Grading, &amp; Classification (% survival)
1: Confined to organ of interest (90%)
2: Beyond organ but not crossing midline (75%)
3: Crossing midline (30%)
4: Distant metastasis (10%)
4S: Age &lt; 1 year, metastatic disease confined to skin, liver, and bone marrow (near 100%)

Stage 4S: SKin liver bone marrow
Better prognosis!
Prognosis better when neener &lt; 1 year

1. Localized tumor with complete gross excision

2A. Localized tumor with incomplete gross excision

2B. Localized tumor w/ w/o incomplete gross excision but WITH ipsilateral nonadeherent LNs positive for tumor
- Enlarged contralateral nodes must be neg

3. Unresectable tumor that infiltrates across the midline +/- regional LN involvement, unilateral tumor with contralateral node, or midline tumor with b/l LN involvement 

4. Any distant mets to lymph nodes, bone, bone marrow, liver, skin, and/or other organs, except as defined for stage 4S.

4S. Localized primary tumor, as defined for stage 1, 2A, or 2B, with dissemination limited to skin, liver, and/or bone marrow (by definition limited to infants younger than 12 months).

(MIBG scan should be negative for bone marrow disease; e.g. bone marrow disease should be &lt;10% total cells malignant on bone marrow bx)

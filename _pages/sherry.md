title: "Sherry"

rape case in which defendants asked for a knowledge standard as to non-consent; Court says NO, it's NEVER knowledge; a defense of an honest, good-faith mistake is NOT a defense; NO jurisdiction has ever used knowledge; we don't care what the defendant thought b/c we already know they're culpable

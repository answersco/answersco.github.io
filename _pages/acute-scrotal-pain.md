title: "Acute scrotal pain"

1. Epididymitis: Epididymal head is most common part involved (increased size and hyperemia) Occurs in those UNDER 2 and over 6. 
2. Orchitis: almost always occurs in associated with epididymitis. When ISOLATED the answer is MUMPS. 
3. Torsion of the testicular appendages: most common cause of ACUTE scrotal pain age 7-14. Sudden pain with BLUE DOT sign on physical exam. Enlargement of the testicular appendage (greater than 5 mm) considered best indicator of torsion. 
NOTE: The testicular appendix (appendage) is along the superior pole of the testis in between the testes and the epididymis. If NORMAL, should look like an oval sesile shape (look at attached imaged)
4. Testicular torsion: Caused by a failure of the tunica vaginalis and testis to connect &quot;bell clapper deformity&quot;. Deformity is usually BILATERAL so if one twist they will usually orchiopexy the other. Ultrasound findings include absent or asymmetric decreased blood flow, asymmetric enlargement, and slight decreased echogenicity.

title: "Pathophysiology and major locations of thoracic outlet syndrome"

3 locations that TOS can occur:
-Scalene triangle: most common site of arterial compression, often associated with anomalous or accessory rib
-Costoclavicular space
-Subpectoral space

Arterial compression may be due to hypertrophy or normal structures, or anomalous muscular, ligamentous, or bony structures
-Repetitive crushing of artery with arm motion results in development of focal narrowing and post-stenotic dilatation.
-Thrombus may form in dilated or aneurysmal segments, with subsequent distal embo.

title: "Relative noise"
---
Relative noise&#8594;what is visually perceived as noise by a human observer of an image is the relative noise (&#963;/N)
When N doubles, the relative noise in the image &#8595; by a factor of &#8730;2 (&#963;/N = &#8730;2/2 = 1/&#8730;2) &#8594; leading to improved contrast resolution and greater visibility of low-contrast objects.
As the # of x-ray photons is doubled, SNR &#8593; by a factor of &#8730;2 (2/&#8730;2)

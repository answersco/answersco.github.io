title: "Why is detecting an occult spinal dysraphism important?"

These lesions are often asymptomatic in infancy (such as lipomyeolmeningocele) which anatomically tether the distal spinal cord resulting in progressive mechanical traction as the child's vertebral column grows. This traction can over time impair the micro-circulation of the spinal cord causing progressive cord ischemia and neural dysfunction.

-one division
-daughter cells are genetically identical
-occurs in somatic cells
-two daughter cells
-used for growth and repair

-one division
-two daughters cells per cycle
-daughter cells genetically identical
-chromosomes number of daughter cells same as that of parent cell (2n)
-occurs in somatic cells
-occurs throughout life cycle
-used for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction

-cell division
-produces two somatic cells from one
-cells formed are identical

-nuclear division
-occurs in somatic cells (not in gametes)
-for growth, repair, and replacement
-consists of a single division that produces two identical daughter cells
-a continuous process divided into 4 phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase

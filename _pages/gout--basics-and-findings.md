Gout&#8594; inflammatory arthropathy caused by sodium-urate deposition in the joints.
Excess uric acid may be secondary to under-excretion (more common, usually from renal insufficiency) or overproduction (much rarer, usually in younger patients) &#8594; it takes about 10-20 years of hyperuricemia before clinical syndrome of gout develops.
Negatively birefringent, needle-like crystals within neutrophils.
Great toe most commonly involved, but it can occur in any joint
XR hallmarks&#8594; sharply-marginated erosions with overhanging margins, associated with soft-tissue gouty tophi.
Joint-spaces are typically preserved until late in disease.
Bony mineralization is preserved.

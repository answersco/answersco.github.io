title: "Proper functioning chest tube drainage"
---
1) Gentle bubbling in suction control -- does not help if bubbling like a jacuzzi b/c it will evaporate fluid in system faster and you will lose suction

2) Tidaling in water seal: a gently moving back and forth of fluid representing pt breathing
Inhaling means fluid pulled up straw and as they exhale the water level falls back down
-If stop tidaling, the system is no longer patent or communicating with the chest b/c as the pt inhales negative pressure in the chest will be made which pulls the fluid up one side of water seal so if not happening then not patent
-Bubbling in water seal indicates air leak

3) Drainage: should be consistent overtime, in amount and characteristics 
-drainage decreases as the days go on
-drainage will be very bloody right after surgery but after a few hours it could change it serosanguineous

title: "MR sequences that help distinguish perivascular spaces from parenchymal lesions"
---
Proton-density and FLAIR sequences. PD: CSF has similar signal intensity as white matter. Perivascular space is isointense to brain. Ischemic lesions are bright due to gliosis. FLAIR: Parenchymal lesions with gliosis have abnormal signal.

title: "Collateral supply to the spleen"
---
Spleen receives collateral blood supply from:
The left gastric artery via the short gastrics
The right gastroepiploic to the left gastroepiploic arteries
Arteries from the tail of the pancreas
Omental collaterals (arc of Barkow)

This rich collateral bed allows splenic artery occlusion to be well tolerated.

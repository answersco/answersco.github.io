title: "Secondary active transport"
---
-example is symports in the apical surface
-they do not directly consume ATP, but are dependent on the primary transport Na+/K+ pumps at the base of the cell to establish the sodium concentration gradient

-also called coupled transport (cotransport)
-no energy directly consumed but relies on the existence of a concentration gradient established and maintained by active transport
-Sodium glucose transport: lets Na+ in and carries glucose along (let you in but you gotta do a job)

title: "Fibrolamellar HCC:"

Fibrolamellar HCC&#8594; subtype in young patients without cirrhosis
Tends to be large when diagnosed, but better prognosis than typical HCC, and no elevation of AFP
MRI: large, heterogeneous mass
Fibrotic central scar is classic&#8594; hypointense on T1- and T2-weighted images (in contrast to FNH scar that is T2-hyperintense and enhances late).
Capsular retraction seen in 10%
Unlike HCC, fibrolamellar subtype does not have a capsule &#8594; there may be a pseudocapsule of peripherally-compressed normal hepatic tissue.

Younger patient (&lt;35) without cirrhosis
Normal AFP
Central scan does not enhance, and is usually T2 dark.
Gallium avid (so is normal HCC).
Calcifies more than normal HCC.

Young pt without cirrhosis, non elevated AFP. Central scar that is T2 dark and does not enhance (unlike FNH, where scar fills in)

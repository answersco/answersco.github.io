title: "CFA aneurysm: diagnosis, treatment indications"
---
CFA: true aneurysms usually degenerative, while most pseudoaneurysms are related to angio procedures or surgical anastomoses.
-Degen: bilateral in 70%
-Normal CFA averages ~ 9 mm in adult men
-Diameter of 2 cm is considered an aneurysm
-2.5 cm is considered an indication for intervention

Post-op patients: must distinguish aneurysm from the generous hood of a graft
-Diameter &gt; 2 cm and presence of mural thrombus are clues to aneurysm diagnosis.

-Angio may be required for complex lesions or when distal embo is suspected.

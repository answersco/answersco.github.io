title: "What types of veins are Labbe &amp; Trolard? Which is more lateral?"
---
Both are SUPERFICIAL ANASTOMOTIC VEINS: that both drain to the Superifical middle cerebral vein

* As one of these gets large, the other gets smaller (same drainage territory)

- Trolard (TOP) connects superfiical middle vein to superior sagittal sinus

- Labbe (LOWER) connects superficial middle vein to TRANSVERSE sinuses (more lateral and LARGER usually) - courses posteriorly from the Sylvian fissures (which are lateral!)
&quot;Labbe is Lateral and Larger&quot;

MRI has highest sensitivity and sensitivity for evaluation of silicone implant rupture (no contrast needed)
MRI not indicated for evaluation of saline implants (physical exam, MM, US)

Intracapsular rupture&#8594; may manifest clinically as subtle contour change
Imaging: MM often normal
MRI&#8594; linguine sign &#8594; fragmented shell freely floating within the silicone contained within the fibrous capsule.
US&#8594; shows segments of broken and collapsed implant wall within the intracapsular silicone.

Extracapsular rupture
MM&#8594; may show high density silicone extending beyond the edge of the capsule into the breast parenchyma.
US&#8594; snowstorm appearance

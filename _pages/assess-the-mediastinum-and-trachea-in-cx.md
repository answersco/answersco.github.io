Do this to see whether they seem central and not overly &quot;bulky&quot; (suggesting abnormal, possibly cancerous growth). The trachea can be displaced in certain conditions including pleural effusion, atelectasis, pneumothorax, fibrosis and tumors. It is also important to note the position of the hilar points, formed by descending upper lobe veins crossing behind lower lobe arteries. The hilar points can change position, typically in lobar collapse.

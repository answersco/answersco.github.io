title: "Isotopes vs. isobars vs. isotones vs. isomers"
---
Element is defined by the # of protons (Z). There may be multiple isotopes of a given element varying in the # of neutrons (N). The particles in the nucleus (Z + N) are referred to as nucleons. The atomic mass # (A) is given by A = 2 + N

Isotopes = same # of protons (Z)
-Examples- I-131 (53 protons) and I-123 (53 protons)

Isobars = same atomic mass (A)
-Examples: I-131 (53 protons) and Xe-131 (54 protons)

Isotones = same # of neutrons (N)
-Examples: N13 (7 protons) and O14 (8 protons)

Isomers = different energy state
-Examples: Tc99 and Tc99m

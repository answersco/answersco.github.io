The xrays exiting on the anode/target side (+) have substancially more metal to traverse and therefore in-target filtering occurs. Higher energy xrays are the only ones leaving on the anode side.

The xrays exiting the target on the anode/target side (+) have substancially more metal to traverse and therefore intra-target filtering occurs. Higher energy xrays are the only ones leaving on the anode side.

Greater with smaller anode angle. 
Greater on anode end of anode- more absorbed

Xrays that are closer to the anode side had to travel through more attenuating material and are less intense. Remember &quot;cathode to chest wall&quot;

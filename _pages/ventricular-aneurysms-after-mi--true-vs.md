title: "Ventricular aneurysms after MI: true vs false"
---
True: mouth wider than body. 
Myocardium is intact.
Usually anterior-lateral wall
May see thinned myocardium with ventricular thrombus
Takes months (requires remodeling and thinning)

False: mouth narrow compared to body
Myocardium not intact (pericardial adhesions contain the rupture)
Usually posterior-lateral wall
Higher risk of rupture.
Most commonly occurs within 3-7 days

True aneurysm
- mouth wider than body
- myocardium intact
- anterior-lateral wall
- low risk of rupture (because myocardium intact)
- months to form (requires remodeling and thinning)

False aneurysm
- mouth narrow compared to body
- myocardium not intact (pericardial adhesions contain the rupture)
- posterior-lateral wall
- Higher risk of rupture.
- Most commonly occurs within 3-7 days

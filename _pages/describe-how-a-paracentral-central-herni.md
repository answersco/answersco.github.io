title: "Describe how a paracentral/central herniation affects the nerve root compared to a lateral herniation?"
---
Paracentral or central affects descending nerve at that level. So for example at L4-L5 would get the L5 root. A lateral would get the nerve exiting at that level which would be the L4 root.

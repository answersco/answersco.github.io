title: "What are the three patterns of washout on MRI and their associated risk of malignancy?"
---
Persistent (Type I): Progressive, continued increase in signal over time; 6% malignant

Plateau (Type II): SI does not change over time after initial rise; flat (&#177; 10%); 64% malignant

Washout (Type III): SI decreases after peaking; 87% malignant
Normal lymph nodes often show washout kinetics

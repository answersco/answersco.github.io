title: "T1 relaxation?"

The Mz longitudinal magnetization vector grows exponentially when exposed to B0. The time it takes the longitudinal magnetization vector to grow to 63% of its maximum value is defined at the T1 Relaxation Time. This spin lattice relaxation property is unique in that each tissue has a different T1 relaxation time. Mxy is zero.

The Mz longitudinal magnetization vector grows exponentially when exposed to B0. The time it takes the longitudinal magnetization vector to grow to 63% of its maximum value is defined at the T1 Relaxation Time. This spin lattice relaxation property is unique in that each tissue has a different T1 relaxation time. Mxy is zero. T1 relaxation time is effected by field strength.

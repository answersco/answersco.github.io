title: "Chemical shift Type 1 occurs in which direction? How do you decrease it?"
---
Occurs in the frequency encoding gradient
- Occurs in both GRE &amp; Spin Echo

Less Chemical shift if you:
- Increase receiver bandwidth
- Increase gradient strength (&quot;Gradient is Great&quot; for getting rid of chemical shift)
- Decrease magnetic field strength (&quot;Field strength is freaking bad&quot; for getting rid of chemical shift - Want it to be LOW - it's not seen below 1 Tesla)

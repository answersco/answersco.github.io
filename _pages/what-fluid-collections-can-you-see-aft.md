title: "- what fluid collections can you see after a transplant (3) - how do they look on blood pool images - how soon after transplant do you see them? - how will they look on delayed imaging?"
---
Urinomas, hematomas, and lymphoceles 
- all cause photopenic areas on blood pool imaging

Urinoma: 
- usually 1st 2 weeks post-op
- Delayed imaging: shows tracer between the bladder and transplanted kidney.

- Hematoma will not have tracer in it.

Lymphocele: 
- usually 4-8 weeks post-op
- Looks like a photopenic area on delayed scan
- Can get large and cause mass effect, otherwise incidental.

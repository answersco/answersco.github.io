title: "What area of the myocardium is most susceptible to ischemia?  A) Subepicardium B) Mid myocardium C) Subendocardium D) All areas are equally susceptible to ischemia"

C. Subendocardium. The mechanism for increased susceptability of the subendocarium to ischemia is not completely understood, however, it is likely related to decrease perfusion during systole, higher levels of wall stress, and differences in metabolism as compared to the mid myodcardium and subepicardium.

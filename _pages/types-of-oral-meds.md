1) tablets
2) capsules
3) liquid: elixirs, suspensions
4) powder: have to be reconstituted 
5) time released: typical suffixes (-sr, -cr, -er, -ec, -xt, -xr); if crushed then pt will get medication all at once instead of a little at a time
6) buccal route: between inner cheek and gum (anesthetics, pain meds, cardiac meds)
7) sublingual route: under the tongue, gets absorbed immediately into the blood stream from your mucus so it acts quicker

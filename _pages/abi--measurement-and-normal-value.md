title: "ABI: measurement and normal value"
---
Using BP cuff and Doppler probe, determine SBP at the ankle (DP or PT) and the brachial artery
-Measure in both arms, and use the higher value
-Ratios are often slightly greater than 1 in normal individuals
-In patient with occlusive disease, the ABI correlates roughly with the extent of disease and degree of ischemia.

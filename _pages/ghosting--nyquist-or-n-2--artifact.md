title: "Ghosting (Nyquist or N/2) Artifact"
---
Nyquist ghost&#8594; appears as an image copy or multiple copies with decreased intensity that is shifted from the center of the FOV.
Occurs along the phase-encoding direction.
Origin: errors in phase between readouts, due to imperfections in gradient performance (Nyquist). Can also be caused by patient motion (blurring).
Because of the strong demand that an echo-planar-imaging (EPI) sequence places on gradient speed and performance&#8594; ghosts are particularly common in EPI images.

Remedy&#8594; 
Apply eddy-current correction (Nyquist, or N/2 ghost)
Use flow compensation or apply saturation bands to &#8595; the artifact (flow)
Ask the patient to be still (motion).
Use motion-resistance sequences (e.g. SSFSE, partial NEX, PROPELLOR or BLADE or MULTI-VANE).
Use respiratory or cardiac gating, or use breath-holding techniques.

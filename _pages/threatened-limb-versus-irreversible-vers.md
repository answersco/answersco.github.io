title: "Threatened limb versus irreversible versus critical limb ischemia and management"
---
Threatened: salvageable with prompt intervention
-Slow cap refill, mild motor and sensory impairment, INAUDIBLE arterial doppler, audible venous doppler.

Irreversible: requires amputation
-Absent cap refill, rigid motor impairment, profound sensory impairment, INAUDIBLE arterial AND venous doppler.

Critical limb ischemia: described as rest pain for 2 weeks (or ulceration or gangrene).

Occlusion for &lt; 14 days - thrombolysis is superior
Occlusion for &gt; 14 days- surgery is superior

Isolated suprainguinal embolism- surgery preferred
Fragmented distal emboli- endovascular thrombolysis preferred.

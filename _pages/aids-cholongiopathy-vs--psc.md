title: "AIDS cholongiopathy vs. PSC"
---
Both: intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic multifocal strictures

AIDS: focal strictures of extrahepatic duct &gt; 2 cm
Absent saccular deformities of the ducts
Associated papillary stenosis (60%)

PSC: extrahepatic strictures rarely &gt; 5 mm
Saccular deformities of the ducts
&quot;Cirrhotic pattern with central regenerative hypertrophy&quot;
20% recurrence after transplantation.

PBC has normal extrahepatic ducts, and 95% have anti-mitochondrial antibodies. Excellent prognosis, and responds well to medical tx.

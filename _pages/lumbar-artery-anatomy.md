These paired vessels arise from posterior wall of abdominal aorta at each lumbar level.
They anastomose with intercostal and other chest wall arteries superiorly, the epigastric arteries anteriorly, and the internal iliac arteries inferiorly.

These anastomoses can form the basis of collateral supply to the lower extremity in distal aortic occlusive disease.

In a small percentage, the lower anterior spinal artery (artery of adamkiewicz) arises from an L1 or L2 lumbar artery.

title: "&quot;Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question.&quot;"
---
&quot;Choosing Wisely&quot; Campaign (ACR initiative): includes 5 specific recommendations for radiologists' reporting and physician ordering behavior&#8594; know as the &quot;Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question.&quot;

1. Don't do imaging for uncomplicated headache
Imaging headache for patients without specific risk factors for structural disease (which should be detected by clinical screens) is not likely to change management or improve outcome.
Also, incidental findings lead to additional procedures and expense that do not improve patient well-being.

2. Don't image for suspected PE without moderate/high pre-test probability of PE
Imaging is helpful to confirm or exclude PE only for patients with elevated d-dimer levels and certain specific risk factors, but not for patients with low pre-test probability of PE.

3. Avoid admission or preoperative CXR for ambulatory patients with unremarkable history and physical exam.
CXR is reasonable if acute cardiopulmonary disease is suspected or if there is a history of chronic stable cardiopulmonary disease in a patient older than 70 without CXR within 6 months.

4. Don't do CT for evaluation of suspected appendicitis in children until after US has been considered as an option.
If US results are equivocal, it may be followed by CT.
US is cost-effective, radiation-free, and has excellent accuracy, with reported sensitivity and specificity of 94%.

5. Don't recommend follow-up imaging for clinically inconsequential adnexal cysts
After a good-quality US in women of reproductive age, don't recommend F/U for a classic corpus luteum or simple cyst &lt; 5 cm
Use 1 cm as threshold for simple cysts in postmenopausal women.

title: "What is the difference between MI &amp; TI in US?"

Thermal index = max temperature rise in tissue 2/2 energy absorption 

Mechanical index = how likely cavitation will occur considering peak rarefaction pressure &amp; frequency
- Stable vs transient cavitation
- Stable = micro bubbles already present in the media (expand and contract as the waves cycle)
- Transient = VIOLENT = oscillation becomes so large the bubbles collapse --&gt; shock waves causing tissue damage
* important for US CONTRAST (if MI too high, the micro bubbles in the contrast can rupture and cause capillary damage!)

title: "Compton Scatter?"
---
Compton scatter occurs when an incoming photon transfers only some of its energy to an outer shell e- or free electron which is ejected and the scattered photon (compton photon) changes direction. The compton photon has lower energy than the incident photon and is dependent on the compton angle (which is the angle of deflection). The compton (recoil) e- is ejected from the atom in a billiard ball fashion, the atom is ionized, and the ejected e- can interact with other atoms.

This is where the photon enters the human, hits an OUTER (this is important) shell electron, and has enough energy to EJECT the electron. The photon loses energy in the process and changes direction.

1. This happens at HIGHER energies (dominates when you are ABOVE 30 KeV)
2. This DOES ionize via the newly created &quot;compton electron&quot;
3. It deflects the incoming xray (scattered photon)
4. VARIABLE energies can cause compton scatter (in contrast to the all or nothing photoelectric interaction)

COMPTON contributes to dose AND it degrades imaging quality as the ejected electron may now go hit the detector. 

Other facts: 
1. Predominant interaction of xrays and soft tissue within the diagnostic imaging range 100 kVp and up
2. DOMINANT interaction that contributes to fog/scatter
3. MAJOR source of occupational exposure
4. Probability of compton interactions does NOT depend on Z, but is dependent on the DENSITY of the material (apparently this is not related to the Z?)

Predominates at higher energies relative to coherent and photoelectric. Ionizes an outer shell electron and redirection of the xray (which still has energy) to somewhere random. This is the worst!

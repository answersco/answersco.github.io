title: "ATN vs rejection: hard to tell  1. ATN is normally within the first 3 days after a transplant -blood flow to the kidney is usually diminished (but less impaired than in rejection) -function: worst at 48 hours and then gradually better or no change  2. Accelerated or acute rejection: -abnormal perfusion -abnormal function  3. Hyperacute rejection: -occurs at time of surgery -no perfusion and no function -not just abnormal-&gt;its absent!"

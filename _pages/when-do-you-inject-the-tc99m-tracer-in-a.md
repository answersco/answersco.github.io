title: "When do you inject the Tc99m tracer in a cerebrovascular reserve balloon occlusion test?"
---
ALWAYS AFTER balloon inflation

A balloon occlusion test involves temporary carotid balloon occlusion to evaluate the potential changes in regional cerebral blood flow and regional cerebral perfusion reserve after permanent carotid occlusion. If no neurologic symptoms are observed during balloon occlusion, Tc-99m is typically injected 5 minutes before balloon deflation. In patients with neurological symptoms during balloon occlusion, tracer is injected immediately.

title: "Typical clinical scenario of fibrin sheath formation, and management"
---
Typical scenario: inability to withdraw fluids despite ease of injecting fluids.
-Because fibrin sheath forms a one-way valve on the tip of the catheter

Management:
-2-3 mg tPA usually sufficient
-Disrupt sheath with guidewire, snare from femoral vein approach, balloon angioplasty disruption, and catheter exchange.

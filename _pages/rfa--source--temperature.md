title: "RFA: source, temperature"
---
RF generator in the range of 60-250 W commonly used as the source.
-Alternating current applied to the electrode causes frictional heating.
-Lower temperatures (50-60 C) may induce coagulation in minutes. 
-Temperatures &lt; 50 C do not reliably induce necrosis
-Temp &gt; 100 C are generally avoided because, as tissues boil, gas is produced, which acts as an insulator, impeding further diffusion of heat energy into the surrounding tumor.

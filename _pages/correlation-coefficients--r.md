-statistical calculation that indicates the strength and direction of correlation, cannot be above 1
EX. strong pos. = +0.92
strong neg. = -0.92
weak pos. = +0.46
weak neg. = -0.44
no correlation = 0.0
-which ever is closest to one is the strongest! does Not matter if -0.88 or +0.72... the -0.88 is strongest

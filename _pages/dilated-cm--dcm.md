title: "Dilated CM (DCM)"
---
Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM): most common primary CM, and common cause of CHF
&#189; idiopathic, with the remainder usually due to metabolic, infectious, inflammatory, or toxic etiologies
Characteristic MRI findings:
Impaired wall thickening
Dilated heart chambers
Impaired myocardial fiber shortening
Findings in primary DCM can look similar those in ischemic CM&#8594; DHE can help differentiate them.
Old infarcts&#8594; delayed enhancement in coronary distribution
DCM: may or may not have DHE&#8594; if present, it involves the subepicardium or mid-myocardium instead of subendocardium

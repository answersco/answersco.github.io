title: "Magnification?"
---
M = I/O = SID/SOD. I = image size on receptior. O = object size. SID = source-image-distance. SOD = source-object-distance.

Note: magnification increased when the SOURCE if closer to the patient
Note: magnification increases when object (patient) is far away from the detector

Magnification views are important for breast
How do we accomplish this?
1. Increase the detector to object distance (this DOES increase the dose)
2. The AIR GAP, this is equivalent to a grid (there is NO human created grid used for mag views)

So how do we keep the spatial resolution HIGH with these other changes
- DECREASE the size of the focal spot 
- With smaller focal spot you after to DECREASE the mA so you dont melt your target but you also have to use LONGER exposure times in order to the get enough xrays for a good exposure

ability to enlarge objects

exaggeration of events, ideas, and feelings

Tumor-induced osteomalacia is a paraneoplastic phenomenon, most associated with benign mesenchymal tumors, most notably hemangiopericytoma.
Less commonly it may be associated with malignant mesenchymal tumors, such as osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma.
Symptoms associated with the osteomalacia include myalgias, bone pain, and fracture. Labs show low serum phosphate, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and low serum 1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D levels.

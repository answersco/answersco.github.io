title: "The specific ionization of a particle is dependent on what?"
---
Directly proportional to Charge and inversely proportional to velocity. The specific ionization is a measure of the numbers of ion pairs (IP) generated per unit path length (IP/mm). The higher the electric charge of the particle, the greater the probability of electrical interaction. Conversely, the higher the velocity of the incident particle, the greater the distance between interaction events lowering the IP generated per unit path length.

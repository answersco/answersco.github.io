title: "IMPORTANT: As you increase beam kV, how does your attenuation of bone and soft tissue change? How does the difference in attenuation between the two change?"
---
With increased kV, the attenuation of both bone and soft tissue decreases. 

The attenuation difference between the two materials will also decrease.

-wash top to bottom and front to back and wash limbs distal to proximal

-promote independence but be aware it an intimate experience where pt's may tell you different things than they would if they were just laying in bed
-if pt refuses, they are more willing to do it when you're telling them it's going to happen; give pt's choices of times and location but ensure the bath is going to happen (EX. &quot;Good morning, when would you like your bath 9:30 or 10:15, I'm available whenever)
-if independent but asks you to give them a bath, say you'll set everything up for her, or ask if they need their back washed, or if anything happened since you just saw them being active and walking around

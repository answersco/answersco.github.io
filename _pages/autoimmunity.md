title: "Autoimmunity"
---
-immune system attacks the tissues of an individual's own body
-autoantibodies recognize self proteins
-about 5% of the population has an autoimmune disorder
-signs and symptoms reflect the cell types under attack
-regulatory T cells control self tolerance. T reg defects have been shown to contribute to the loss of tolerance in human autoimmune diseases.

Arises in several ways:
1. viruses use host proteins on the viral cell surface
-proteins become the target of the immune system, which responds as if they were viral proteins
2. thymocytes that recognize self antigens survive instead of self-destructing
3. nonself antigen may coincidentally resemble self antigens
4. skewed X inactivation

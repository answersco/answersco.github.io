1) Risk reduction
-Smoking cessation

2) Nutritional treatment
-Small frequent meals - when full, the stomach puts pressure on the diaphragm and makes it harder to breathe 
-High protein, low carb (when metabolized, carbs break down into CO2, which they already have too much off), high fat to achieve most calories and have least amount of CO2 production
-Adequate hydration to help liquefy secretions - careful when &quot;blue bloaters&quot; b/c have R-side HF so hydrations need controlled

3) Bronchodilators: 
-give first then go to steroid

4) Corticosteroids: 
-rinse mouth after using

5) Surgery
-Lung volume reduction surgery
-Lung transplant

6) Pulmonary Rehabilitation
-Patient education on things they need to do to conserve energy
-Breathing exercises: pursed lip breathing, diaphragmatic breathing, measure pulse ox during oxygen therapy to make sure they are maintaining adequate O2 levels
-Activity pacing
-Self-care activities
-Physical conditioning: little bit of time and increasing over time so pt can build up some stamina
-Coping mechanisms
-Oxygen: need to be on lowest amount of oxygen they can while still maintain their SATs; no more than 3 L b/c it can knock out their drive to breathe

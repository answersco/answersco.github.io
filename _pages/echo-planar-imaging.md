title: "Echo-planar imaging"
---
Can be done with SE or GRE
Single shot image (one RF pulse)
Phase and frequency gradients turned on/off rapidly -&gt; rapid filling of k space -&gt; fast acquisition (~100 ms/slice)
Used for DWI
Compared to regular GRE:
- better contrast
- faster
- more magnetic susceptibility
- ghosting artifacts (due to spatial encoding)
- chemical shift artifact

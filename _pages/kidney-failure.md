title: "Kidney failure"
---
-if worried about kidney function, we look at BUN and creatinine
-we do this because these are measures of waste excretion in the blood
-when either lab values are increased, it means kidney functioning levels are decreased
-creatinine is more indicative of kidney failure -&#8212;those who do hemodialysis will have high creatinine

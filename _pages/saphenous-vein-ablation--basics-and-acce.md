title: "Saphenous vein ablation: basics and access"
---
-Catheter-based ablation of saphenous veins offer an effective perc alternative to venous stripping.
-Laser and RFA have been used for success.
-Can be applied to GSV, SSV, and accessory saphenous veins. Veins of any depth can be treated, but very superficial veins (&lt; 5mm below dermis) may be both palpable and visible as brownish stain for months after treatment.
-Usual site of entry just below the lowest point of reflux. Access below the knee for the GSV carries increased risk of injury to cutaneous nerve branches (localized sensory loss over medial calf). When treating SSV, access shouldn't be lower than lower border of gastrocs to avoid injury to sural nerve.

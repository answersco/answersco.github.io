title: "Mechanism of microwave ablation (MWA)"
---
MWA: uses an electromagnetic device coupled to an applicator to induce tumor necrosis by using frequencies from 900 - 2450 MHz.
-Rapidly-oscillating charge is produced, causing rapid motion of water molecules, leading to frictional heating.
-As with RFA, goal of treatment with MWA is to achieve sustained temperatures &gt; 50 and ideally &gt; 60 C.

title: "Perc gastrostomy in post-op stomach: technique"
---
Sometimes stomach can be entered directly with needle. Otherwise, the efferent small bowel loop can be punctured and the catheter tip ultimately positioned in gastric remnant.

Post-op gastric remnants are relatively fixed in the abdomen due to post-op fibrosis and adhesions. T-fasteners thus generally not used.

Access to stomach gained with a one-stick needle system.
-Tract is dilated.
-12-14 French nephrostomy-type catheter placed in gastric remnant.

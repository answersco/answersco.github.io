Non-Masslike Enhancement (NMLE) &#8594; enhancing region that is not a mass or focus
Like MM calcifications, NMLE is described both in terms of distribution and morphology.
Distribution:
Linear/ductal&#8594; points toward the nipple, conforming to a duct
Up to 26% malignant, typically seen with clumped enhancement morphology.

Segmental&#8594; triangular-shaped, pointing towards nipple &#8594; suggests ductal etiology
Most common distribution of DCIS (42% of cases)

Focal area&#8594; distribution &lt; 25% of a quadrant

Regional&#8594; geographic distribution &gt; 25% of a quadrant

Multiple regions&#8594; at least 2 regions of NMLE

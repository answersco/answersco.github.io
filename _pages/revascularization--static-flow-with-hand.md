title: "Revascularization: static flow with hand injection after crossing a lesion"
---
Static flow: indicates either occlusion of the stenosis by the catheter or subintimal injection
-Filling a normal caliber lumen and branches indicates successful crossing of the lesion
-Focal pooling of contrast or tracking around a central unopacified lumen indicates a subintimal location. This is also suggested by a spiral or &quot;barber pole&quot; trajectory of the guidewire.

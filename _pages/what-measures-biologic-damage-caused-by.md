title: "What measures biologic damage caused by ionizing gamma radiation?"
---
Roentgen equivalent man (REM): measures biologic damage caused by ionizing gamma radiation.
Based on the biological damage caused by ionization in human body tissue.
It is a term for dose equivalence, and equals the biological damage that would be caused by 1 radiation absorbed dose (RAD).
It accounts for the fact that not all types of radiation are equally effective in producing biological change or damage (e.g. the damage from 1 RAD deposited by beta radiation is less than that caused by 1 RAD of alpha radiation).
The REM is numerically equal to the dose in RADs multiplied by a quality factor, which accounts for the difference in the amount of biological damage caused by the different types of radiation.

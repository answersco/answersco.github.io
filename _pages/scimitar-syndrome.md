title: "Scimitar syndrome:"
---
Scimitar syndrome&#8594; partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR) from RLL pulmonary veins into either the right atrium or IVC (unlike TAPVR, in which all 4 pulmonary veins return to right atrium, requiring a right-to-left shunt for survival).
Anomalous vein looks like a scimitar on the frontal images
Can be associated with hypoplasia and hyperlucency of the right lung.

This is PAPVR with pulmonary hypoplasia

Right sided PAPVR
Pulmonary hypoplasia

- Anomalous draining of the right inferior pulmonary vein into the inferior vena cava
- hypoplasia of the right lung, hypoplasia of the right pulmonary artery, and hypoplastic systemic arteries supplying the right lung

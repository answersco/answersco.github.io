Cardiac Imaging&#8594; best performed during diastole
Prospective ECG-triggering: AKA &quot;Step and Shoot&quot;
Based on R-R interval
Axial imaging, not helical
&#8595; dose because tube isn't on the whole time
No functional imaging

Retrospective EKG-Gating: scans the entire time, then back-calculates
Can do functional imaging
Lower pitch&#8594; higher radiation dose
Helical mode scanning

title: "Delayed wound healing"
---
1) age
-skin is not as thick when younger
-epithelization takes longer as we get older
2) malnutrition
3) obesity
-fatty tissue lacks adequate blood supply to resist bacterial infections and deliver nutrients and cellular elements for healing
-operative time is longer and an be more traumatic
-more wound pressure with extra tissue
4) hypoxia
-not enough oxygen in blood causing delayed wound healing
5) smoking
-decreases the amount of functional hemoglobin in the blood, thus decreasing tissue oxygenation
6) drugs
-steroids, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory, chemotherapy
7) diabetes mellitus
-more susceptible to infection
-often have impaired circulation
8) radiation and cancer
-alter the ability of rapidly dividing cells, even the noncancerous ones
-radiation is damaging to the skin
-may cause tissue to become fragile and poorly oxygenated
9) anemia
10) renal insufficiency
-causes build up of toxins in our blood stream so our body is unable to get rid of toxins as sufficiently
11) hypovolemia
-not enough circulating volume
12) immune system compromise
-not enough WBCs to fight off infections
13) surgery &gt; 3 hours
-body is not used to being open that long
14) emergency surgery
-does not allow for much preparation than planned surgeries so there is an increase for infection

title: "Active transport"
---
-movement of ions &quot;uphill&quot; from area of lesser concentration to area of greater concentration
-requires energy/atp
-sodium/potassium pump

-uses energy to move substances against a concentration gradient (from low to high)
-Na+/K+ pump: NA+ outside and K+ inside, maintains concentration gradient

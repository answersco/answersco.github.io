title: "Give an example of positive feedback. Does the body go towards or away from the dynamic equilibrium?"
---
1) Head of fetus pushes against cervix which stimulates stretch receptors in cervical wall
2) Nerve impulses from the cervix are transmitted to the brain by sensory neurons
3) Brain stimulates pituitary gland to secrete oxytocin which is determined by the integrating center
4) Oxytocin stimulates uterine contractions and pushes the fetus toward the cervix
Oxytocin stimulated the effector and enhances the original situation
-Fever is beneficial up to a certain point but if it rises about 104F it can create a dangerous positive feedback loop

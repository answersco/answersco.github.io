title: "MRI is used to characterize what finding in osteochondroma?"

Answer: chondral cap
MRI provides excellent soft-tissue contrast for evaluation and measurement of the chondral cap of an osteochondroma. 

Large chondral cap (&gt; 2 cm) is worrisome for malignant transformation.
-The acceptable size of a chondral cap is greater than 2 cm in a child until growth plates are closed.

StatDx:
MR: Orderly hyaline cartilage cap, mildly undulating and not exceeding 1 cm in width in adults
Cap has lobulated high signal of hyaline cartilage on fluid-sensitive sequences
Cap covered by thin perichondrium, low signal on T1 and T2 sequences
Enhancement limited to thin fibrovascular tissue covering (nonenhancing) cartilage cap and thin septae within cap

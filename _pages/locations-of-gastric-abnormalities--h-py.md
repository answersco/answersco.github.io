H pylori gastritis: antrum
ZES: duodenal bulb most common, also jejunum and stomach. Secondary to gastrinoma.
Crohn's: uncommon in stomach, but if present will involve the antrum.
Menetrier's: usually in the fundus, and classically spares the antrum.
Lymphoma: &quot;crosses the pylorus,&quot; though less frequently than adenocarcinoma does.

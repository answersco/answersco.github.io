Cardiovascular diseases with an enlarged cardiac silhouette:
Cardiomyopathy secondary to CHF 
Valvular regurgitation (AV, MV, or TV)
High-output or volume overload states 
Dilated CM
Pericardial effusion
Paracardiac masses

To distinguish between various causes of enlarged heart cardiac disease, the key structures to evaluate are the LA and the aorta
LA is enlarged and cardiac silhouette is enlarged: suggests mitral regurgitation
Aorta is enlarged and cardiac silhouette is enlarged: suggests aortic regurgitation.
Neither LA nor aorta is enlarged: suggests one of the other above etiologies.

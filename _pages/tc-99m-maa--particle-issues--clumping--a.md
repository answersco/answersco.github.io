title: "Tc-99m MAA: particle issues, clumping, and tracer in brain"
---
Particles: ~10-100 micrometers (want them to stay in lung, but not block arterioles)
-Reduce for children and s/p pneumonectomy (fewer capillaries).
-Reduce for pulmonary HTN
-Reduce for patients with right-to-left shunt (don't want to block brain capillaries).
-Dose is the same

Brain uptake: shunt- possibly ASD, VSD, or pulmonary AVM.

Multiple focal, scattered hot spots (clumping)
-Tech draws blood into the syringe prior to injection.

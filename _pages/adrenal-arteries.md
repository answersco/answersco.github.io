title: "Adrenal arteries"
---
Adrenals are retroperitoneal organs that receive blood supply from renal arteries, directly from Ao, the inferior phrenic arteries, and rarely from celiac or SMA.
Usually 3 adrenal arteries: inferior, middle, and superior.
These are often linked to capsular renal branches, providing potential collateral pathways for supply of the kidney.

Inferior adrenals: arises directly from proximal renal arteries in 2/3. 
Middle adrenal arteries: small vessels that usually arise directly from Ao, and occasionally from celiac or SMA.
Superior adrenals: these are constant branches of the inferior phrenic arteries, though the origin of the inferior phrenic arteries are less predictable (from aorta or celiac in 2/3, occasionally from renal or left gastric arteries).

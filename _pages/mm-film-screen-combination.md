title: "MM film/screen combination"
---
MM uses single-emulsion film matched to a single intensifying screen in the cassette
Advantages: 
Less parallax
Less crossover
Better spatial resolution
Disadvantage: increased dose

Screen: basically a scintillator that turns x-rays into light
Allows less dose (lower exposure time)
Lateral light diffusion within screen will reduce spatial resolution
No effect on scatter

Thicker screen: 
Reduces dose
Worsens lateral light diffusion&#8594; worse spatial resolution
The film should be positioned on top of the intensifying screen&#8594; limits halation, and improved spatial resolution (less blur).

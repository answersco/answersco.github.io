title: "&quot;Second victim&quot;"
---
A healthcare worker who is traumatized by, or unduly punished for an error or adverse patient event is deemed to be a &quot;second victim.&quot;
&quot;Second victimization&quot; was extremely common in the traditional &quot;blameful&quot; culture of American medicine that prevailed until the early part of the current century, where all errors and adverse events were blamed on one individual wherever possible.

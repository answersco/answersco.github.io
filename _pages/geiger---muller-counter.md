title: "Geiger - Muller Counter"
---
Used to detect ionizing radiation (alpha, beta, gamma)
Very sensitive
Great for low level radioactive survey
Terrible for HIGH radiation fields due to dead time (this is where the probe is overloaded which causes a dead time where the ionization must dissipate)
Maximum Dose it can handle is 100mR/h. 
CANNOT provide information of the radiation type

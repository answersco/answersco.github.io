title: "Mid aortic syndrome"
---
Progressive narrowing of the abdominal aorta and major branches
Long segment
Children and young adults
Intrauterine insult - fragmentation of the elastic media
Triad:
HTN
Claudication
Renal failure

Progressive narrowing of the abdominal aorta and its major branches
Compared to Leriche syndrome, this is higher, and longer segment.
Tends to affect children and young adults
Not secondary to AS or arteritis- instead likely intrauterine insult.

Triad:
HTN
Claudication
Renal failure

Mid abdominal aortic narrowing with HTN, claudication, renal failure. Not due to vasculitis or athero.

In utero insult causes fragmentation of elastic media --&gt; Progressive Narrowing of the aorta and major branches (young children, higher and longer segment than Leriche)

- Triad: HTN, Claudication, renal failure

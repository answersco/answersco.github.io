title: "What does captopril due mechanistically in RAS?"
---
It prevents Angiotensin I --&gt; II, so it PREVENTS efferent arteriole constriction. 

In compensated RAS, the Angiotensin II activates aldosterone and you get efferent arteriole constriction to elevate the AFFERENT arteriole pressure and maintain your GFR.

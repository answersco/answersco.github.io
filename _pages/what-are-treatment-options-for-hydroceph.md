title: "What are treatment options for hydrocephalus?"
---
Remove the cause: when feasible, ie in trauma or bleed.
3rd vent-ostomy: 3rd ventricle to suprasellar cistern (pineal masses, aqueductal stenosis, posterior fossa tumors)
Extracranial diversion: VP shunts for any type of hydrocephalus; lumboperitoneal shunt for communicating hydrocephalus (may generate Chiari I malformation secondarily)
External diversion: for infected CSF.
No treatment: if hydrocephalus is considered arrested

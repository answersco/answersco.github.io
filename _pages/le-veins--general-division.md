title: "LE veins: general division"
---
LE veins divided into superficial and deep systems, linked by perforating veins.
Perforating veins direct blood from superficial into deep system.
All LE veins normally have valves.
In contrast to the UEs, the deep veins of the LE are the dominant drainage pathway.

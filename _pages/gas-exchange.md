-PaCO2 and PaO2 are gases found in arterial blood 

-delivery of O2 from air we inhale to the bloodstream

-elimination of CO2 collected from bloodstream and expelled into air - occurs in alveoli and capillaries

-air we breath in to the exchange in the blood stream and the elimination of CO2 that is exchanged between the alveoli and capillaries

includes respiration and ventilation

-delivery of oxygen from the lungs to the bloodstream and the elimination of CO2 from the bloodstream to the lungs
-occurs in the lungs between the alveoli and capillaries located in the walls of the alveoli

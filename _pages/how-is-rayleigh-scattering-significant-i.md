title: "How is Rayleigh scattering significant in diagnostic imaging?"
---
Rayleigh scattering = Coherent scattering.
Contributes noise to the image and can degrades SNR.
No ionization occurs, and no deposition of energy into the atom occurs, so there is not effect on patient dose.
They account for &lt; 5% of photon interactions in soft tissue at photon energies &gt; 70 keV.

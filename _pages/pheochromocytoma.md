Pheochromocytoma: potentially malignant
Rule of 10's: 10% bilateral, 10% malignant, 10% familial/syndrome, 10% extra-adrenal
Syndromic associations: 
MEN 2A and 2B: typically bilateral intra-adrenal pheochromocytomas
VHL
NF1
Carney's triad (gastric leiomyosarcoma, pulmonary chondroma, extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma)
Paraganglioma = an extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma
Most common location (intra-abdominal): organ of Zuckerkandl at the aortic bifurcation
Rarely occur in bladder&#8594; post-micturition syncope
Head and neck: glomus tumors (tympanicum, jugulare, vagale, and carotid body tumor)
NM: 
I-123 MIBG: used for metastatic workup of adrenal pheochromocytoma
Indium-111 pentetreotide: used as tracer for localization of paraganglioma
MRI: classically T2-hyperintense, and may appear heterogeneous when enlarged

MR/CT
- Hetergenous potentially areas of necrosis
- AVID enhancement. Enhancement &gt; 110 HU is compatible with dx (maybe consider a hypervascular met). Adrenal adenomas can look similar but will not enhance as much.
- T2 they are MARKEDLY intense

tumor of adrenal gland and the adrenal medulla releases epi/NR directly in the bloodstream so this tumor releases more plus adding a sympathomimetics which also increases

tumor of adrenal medulla secretes excessive epinephrine and norepinephrine

Malignant: interarterial course (between the aorta and pulmonary artery or RV outflow tract) of an anomalous coronary artery&#8594; high risk of sudden death associated with exercise. Treated with bypass grafting.
Benign: retroaortic, prepulmonic, and septal coronary artery course.
Intramural course of a coronary artery: associated with sudden death
The vessel courses through the wall of the aorta for a short segment.
Typically slit-like configuration of the coronary artery on CCTA.

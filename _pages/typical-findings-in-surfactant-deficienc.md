title: "Typical findings in surfactant deficiency disease and neonatal PNA:"
---
Surfactant deficiency disease&#8594; can look similar to GBS, with low lung volumes and granular-type opacities. Pleural effusion more commonly seen with GBS (25%) than surfactant deficiency.

Neonatal PNA&#8594; bilateral, diffuse, granular-type opacities, possibly with pleural effusion, and low lung volumes.

title: "Info: 1) implants have implant membrane (envelope) &amp; fibrous capsule outside of that INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE (MC): rupture of envelope w/o rupture of capsule (contained), can be difficult to distinguish from herniation Mammo: 1) can't see intracapsular rupture 2) deformity of implant contour suggests &amp; warrants US/MR to distinguish intracapsular rupture from herniation  US: &quot;stepladder&quot;: horizontal echogenic curvilinear, parallel lines (collapsed implant membrane floating in silicone) MR: &quot;linguini sign&quot; A) central B) goes all way across - radial fold doesnt C) best seen on T2 images w/ water suppression EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE: rupture of both envelope &amp; capsule,allowing silicone to extravasate. Mammo: 1) free silicone in breast or axilla.  US: 1) hyperechoic &quot;snowstorm&quot; appearance w/ posterior shadowing MR: 1) droplets w/ same signal as silicone w/i breasts or axilla 2) most also have &quot;linguine sign&quot; b/c envelope has to be torn too HERNIATION: 1) not true rupture 2)intact envelope pushes through a defect in fibrous tissue capsule Tx: implants removed and replaced Info: 1) Implant patients w/ MLO and CC whole breast &amp; implant-displaced views (partially seen mass(*)) 2) saline not as dense as silicone  CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE: course Ca+ develop in fibrous capsule after capsular contraction Tx: capsulotomy"

title: "Heart valve pearls (most superior, inferior valves, pacemaker wire through valve)"
---
Point parts of mechanical valves point outward (towards the direction of flow)

Mitral valve larger than aortic valve

Pacemaker wire going through a valve = tricuspid (lead going to RV)

Pulmonic valve is most superior (and posterior to AV on lateral)

Inferior valves: tricuspid (anterior) and mitral (posterior)

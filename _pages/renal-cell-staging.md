T2 : limited to kidney &gt; 7 cm

T3 : tumour / tumour thrombus extension into adrenal or renal vein or perinephric tissues (but contained by Gerota's fascia)
T3a : spread to perinephric fat
T3b : spread to renal vein or intra diaphragmatic IVC
T3c : spread to supra diaphragmatic IVC

T4 : beyond Gerota's fascia.

N0 : no nodal involvement
N1 : single regional lymph node involved
N2 : beyond N1 (NB laterality does NOT affect nodal staging)

M0 : no distant metastases
M1 : distant metastases


Stage groupings

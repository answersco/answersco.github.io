title: "Normal anatomy of bronchial arteries"
---
Bronchial arteries arise from thoracic Ao to supply the airways
Highly variable in number- most common pattern (45%) is 2 on left and one on right
Right bronchial artery arises from a common intercostal trunk in over 70% (5% on left)
25% have single bilateral bronchial arteries
30% have 4 or more

Bronchial arteries usually located on anterolateral surface of thoracic Ao just below ligamentum arteriosum at T3-T4.
Variant origins: inner surface of Ao arch, internal mammary, brachiocephalic, inferior thyroidal, subclavian arteries.

Bronchial arteries (esp those on right) have communication with anterior spinal artery in 10%
Occasionally anastomose with coronary arteries

title: "Nomadic pastoralism"
---
This type of agriculture refers to groups that herded domesticated animals, such as cattle, sheep, or goats, between grazing areas. Nomadic pastoralists often accumulated few possesions, making movement easier. As a result of their mobility, they were involved in trade and the spread of ideas and technology between settled agrarian populations.

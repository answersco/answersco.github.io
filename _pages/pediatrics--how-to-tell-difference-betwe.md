Both found in posterior basal segment of LEFT lung

- Extra lobar tends to be well-defined consolidation at the PERIPHERY (drains to systemic vein - usually azygos)

- Intra lobar tends to be solid mass, dense consolidation, or cystic/multicystic lesion in the center of otherwise normal lung parenchyma (drains to pulmonic vein)

Both have systemic arterial supply

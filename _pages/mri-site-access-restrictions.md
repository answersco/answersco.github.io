Zone 1 (general public): 
Zone 2 (unscreened MR patients): the interface between Zone 1 and the strictly controlled Zones III and IV
Patients are greeted, screening questions answered here.

Zone III (screened MR patients and personnel): this comprises the area where interactions between the MR scanner's magnetic fields with ferromagnetic objects or equipment could result in severe injury or death.
The static magnetic field in Zone III may exceed 50 &#120757;T (5 gauss)
The area should be clearly demarcated and marked as potentially hazardous
Unscreened non-MR personnel shouldn't have access 

Zones IV (screened MR patients under constant direct supervision of trained MR personnel): 
This is synonymous with the MR scanner room.
Should be demarcated and clearly marked by signage as being potentially hazardous due to strong magnetic fields.

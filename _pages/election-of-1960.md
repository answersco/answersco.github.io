title: "Election of 1960"

Kennedy(D) vs Nixon(R). US in recession. Kennedy says US is adrift and promised to get US &quot;moving again&quot;. Nixon tries to ride Ike's popularity. On TV JFK appears young and vibrant compared to Nixon. Very close election. &quot;Style and appearance&quot; now important in politics.

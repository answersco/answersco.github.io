title: "Negative MRI contrast agents?"
---
Negative agents produce substantial magnetic inhomogeneity due to magnetic susceptibility. Magnetic inhomogeneity perturbs the Larmor frequency of protons, resulting in a loss of phase coherence and reduced T2 values. Negative agents are called shift agents, chemical shift agents or frequency agents.

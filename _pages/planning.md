-client's lungs will remain clear to auscultation during hospitalization.
-client will cough productively 4 times per shift.

-developing interventions and rationales

goal setting for:
-safe administration
-safe monitoring
-report side effects
EX: M.J. will independently prepare and administer Insulin injection using correct dose , syringe and technique before discharge

-establish outcome and patient goal: make sure goals are for 6 hours so you can be able to evaluate them (pt will exhibit no signs or symptoms of infection by discharge AEB: Temp WNL and WBC WNL)
-set priorities
-continuity of care

-establish patient centered goals and outcomes - needs to be appropriate to pt (if they cannot stand for 2 minutes then obviously they cannot walk around the floor)
EX. 
-patient's lungs will be clear to auscultation by discharge
-patient will be able to sit in chair for 20 minutes with assist of 1 within 2 days

-outcome identification
-third step of the nursing process, during which goals/outcomes are determined and interventions chosen
-the nurse develops a plan of care that prescribes strategies and alternatives to attain expected outcomes

1) identifies nursing strategies to:
-direct care
-promote continuity of care : sharing plan wth next nurse
-focus charting
-provide for delegation of specific patient care activities : includes other HCP
-nursing intervention classification (NIC) which is one method of identifying patient care strategies

Establishing objectives and goals for an organization and determining the best ways to accomplish them

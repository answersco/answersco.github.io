title: "GRE: benefits, problem, image contrast"
---
GRE is more sensitive to magnetic field inhomogeneity and magnetic susceptibility than is SE.
Can be an advantage&#8594; imaging hemorrhage
Can be a disadvantage&#8594; loss of signal and geometric distortion.

Benefits of GRE:
Short TR
Fast image acquisition time.
Lower specific absorption rate (SAR) = less heating of patient tissues

Problem with GRE: &#8595; signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio

Contrast in GRE Imaging:
GRE&#8594; produces T2<b>, T1, and mixed-weighted (T1/T2</b>2*, T2/T1) images depending mainly on flip angle, TE, TR, and the specific GRE technique used.

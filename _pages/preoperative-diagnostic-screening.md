-glucose
-blood type and cross 
-HCG
2) chest xray (make sure you do not have a URI bc you cannot have surgery if you have an URI) &amp; EKG (stickers placed on the arms, chest, and legs and a print out is produced that graphs the electrical conduction through the heart
3) scans &amp; MRIs: done before surgery so the surgery can have current radiological images of the body part they are going to do surgery on

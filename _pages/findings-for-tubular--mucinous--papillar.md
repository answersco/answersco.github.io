- Tubular = small spiculated slow growing mass with favorable prognosis; assoc with RADIAL SCAR

- Mucinous = Round, circ mass that's uncommon

- Medullary = Round or oval CIRCUMSCRIBED mass that's got large axillary nodes even in absence of mets (typically younger patient 25% with BRCA 1)

- Papillary - complex cystic and solid (axillary nodes NOT common) in ELDERLY women and 2nd most common behind IDC-NOS

- Mucinous = Round, circ mass that's uncommon

- Medullary = Round or oval CIRCUMSCRIBED mass that's got large axillary nodes even in absence of mets (typically younger patient 25% with BRCA 1) = a lot of lymphoid infiltration on histopath

- Papillary - complex cystic and solid (axillary nodes NOT common) in ELDERLY women and 2nd most common behind IDC-NOS

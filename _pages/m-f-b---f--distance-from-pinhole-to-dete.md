title: "M=F/B   F= Distance from pinhole to detector  B= distance from pinhole to patient.  As you move the patient close to the pinhole your lets say making it twice as short as the distance to the detector you will magnify your image by a factor of 2.  -image is also inverted.  -if the object is large you get image distortion where there is increased magnification of the more proximal portions of the patient"

how does the pinhole collimator affect the image magnification?

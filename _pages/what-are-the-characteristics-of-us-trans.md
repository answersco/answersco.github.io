title: "What are the characteristics of US transducer with more dampening, and high-Q value?"
---
Ultrasound transducer: More dampening results in a larger bandwidth of the ultrasound pulse but decreased pulse duration. 
The ratio of the center frequency over the bandwidth of the ultrasound pulse is called the Q-factor. 
High Q transducers have a narrow bandwidth but longer pulse duration, and thus lower spatial resolution along the direction of the ultrasound beam.

Axial resolution improves with higher frequencies and more damping.

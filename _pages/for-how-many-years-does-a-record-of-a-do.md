title: "For how many years does a record of a dose calibrator need to be kept?"
---
When in doubt - 3 years! (except for medically reportable events)

&quot;The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) states that a record of calibrations of instruments used to measure the activity of unsealed by-product material must be kept for 3 years. The records must include the model and serial number of the instrument, the date of the calibration, the results of the calibration, and the name of the individual who performed the calibration.&quot;

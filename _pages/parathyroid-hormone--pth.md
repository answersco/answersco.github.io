title: "Parathyroid hormone (PTH)"
---
secreted by parathyroid glands on posterior surface of thyroid
-PTH released when calcium levels low in blood
-raises calcium blood level by four mechanisms
1) stimulate osteoblasts to release RANKL which will stimulate osteoclasts to reabsorb bone
2) promote calcium reabsorption in kidneys
3) promotes last step of calcitrol synthesis
4) inhibit collagen synthesis by osteoblasts which limits bone deposition

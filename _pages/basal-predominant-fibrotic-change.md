Basal-predominant fibrotic change:
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF): most common cause of basilar fibrosis, almost always featuring basilar honeycombing
End-stage asbestosis: usually other findings such as pleural plaques
NSIP (fibrotic form): commonly associated with collagen vascular disease and drug reaction.
Fibrotic form produces basal-predominant fibrosis. Unlike IPF, honeycombing is usually absent.

title: "Mechanism of CR and factors that affect spatial resolution"
---
CR = indirect digital
Storage phosphor (CR) &#8594; uses special photostimulable phosphor (Barium fluorohalide)
Storage phosphor doesn't emit the absorbed energy as light after interaction with an x-ray&#8594; instead holds a latent x-ray image
Latent image read using a red laser to scan detector&#8594; records how much blue-green light is emitted 
Amount of light detected proportional to the intensity of the incident x-ray
Plate reset by exposure to bright white light to erase it&#8594; ghosting artifacts occur if not performed.

Spatial resolution depends on: 
Laser spot size
Phosphor plate density and thickness
Rate of light sampling

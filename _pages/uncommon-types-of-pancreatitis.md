title: "Uncommon types of pancreatitis"
---
Autoimmune (AI) pancreatitis: associated with elevated IgG4
Sausage-shaped pancreas
Capsule-like delayed rim enhancement around gland (like a scar)
No ductal dilatation or calcifications (unlike chronic pancreatitis)
Elevated IgG4 also associated with retroperitoneal fibrosis, sclerosing cholangitis, inflammatory pseudotumor, and Riedel's thyroiditis
Groove pancreatitis: can present with similar symptoms to cancer, with duodenal and biliary obstruction.
Soft-tissue within the pancreaticoduodenal groove, with or without delayed enhancement
Duodenal stenosis and/or strictures of CBD in 50%
Tropic pancreatitis: young age, associated with malnutrition
Multiple large calculi within a dilated pancreatic duct.
Hereditary pancreatitis: looks like tropical pancreatitis

title: "True or False: Myocardial tagging can be used to assess myocardial function because the tag lines move with the myocardium."
---
True. Tag lines are applied prior to image acquisition by modulating the magnization gradient such that there is no signal coming from the tagged myocardium. Hence, the tag lines move with the initially tagged myocardium throughout the cardiac cycle.

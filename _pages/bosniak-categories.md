Category I: water-attenuation cyst with hairline wall and no enhancement
Always benign; no follow-up needed

Category II: water-attenuation cyst containing a few (3 or fewer) hairline septa. May contain fine septal calcification, but no enhancement.
Also includes small (&lt; 3cm) hyperattenuating cysts without enhancement
Always benign; no follow-up imaging needed.

Category IIF: multiple septa, with minimal smooth thickening (&lt; 3 mm). May have thick and nodular mural calcification. Walls may slightly enhance.
Also includes large (&gt; 3 cm) hyperattenuating cysts without enhancement.
Usually benign; imaging F/U recommended.

Category III: thickened, irregular walls or septa, with measurable enhancement.
Concern for malignancy, but may be benign (e.g. infection, multilocular cystic nephroma)
Treatment is surgical

Category IV: enhancing nodular component separate from the wall or septa
Clearly malignant; surgical lesions.

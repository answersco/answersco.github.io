title: "Measurement of portal pressure:"
---
Measuring portal pressure:
Direct portal vein pressure measurement: requires traversing the hepatic parenchymal&#8594; invasive and impractical
Wedged hepatic vein pressure: routinely measured via an internal jugular vein catheter&#8594; thought to equal PV pressure in most patients.
Portosystemic gradient (AKA corrected sinusoidal pressure): represents the actual sinusoidal resistance to portal flow
= (Wedged hepatic vein pressure) - (free hepatic vein pressure)
Portal HTN: defined as portosystemic gradient &gt; 5 mmHg

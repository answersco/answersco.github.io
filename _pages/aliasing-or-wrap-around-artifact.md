title: "Aliasing or wrap-around artifact?"
---
Appears as an anatomical structure, from outside the field of view, that wraps around to the other side of the image.
Origin: field of view in the phase-encoding direction is smaller than the anatomy that is being imaged. 
Direction: phase-encoding direction; which is left/right in 2D and both left/right AND top/bottom in 3D. In GRE this appears as zebra banding.
Solution: Increase the FOV; alternatively, saturation bands can be applied to null the signal coming from tissue outside the FOV.

title: "Troubleshooting difficult access to portal vein by transhepatic puncture"
---
Percutaneous insertion of a wire or catheter into portal system can provide a target, via either transhepatic intercostal approach or through recanalized umbilical vein.

Metallic coils can be placed percutaneously next to the RPV under CT guidance prior to TIPS.

CT can also be used to place guidewires through the liver, crossing the RPV and entering IVC.
-Wire is snared from jugular access and shunt completed from that approach.

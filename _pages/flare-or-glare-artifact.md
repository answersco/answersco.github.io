title: "Flare or glare artifact"
---
See bright white glare near an area of DECREASED attenuation
Happens when you have a large transition in attenuation
From an overproduction of xrays in the thin area to compensate for the nearby thick area 

IMPORTANT POINT: remember fluoro by default is not going to invert the color scheme like traditional diagnostic xray

title: "FNH:"

FNH: disorganized liver tissue with no malignant potential
Primarily in asymptomatic women, NOT associated with OCPs
Characteristic central scar (consists of T2-hyperintense ductules and venules): demonstrates delayed enhancement 
FNH does not have a capsule
Can be difficult to see without contrast on CT and T1 and T2W MRI sequences
Avidly enhances during arterial phases, then washes out very quickly. PV phase will often show just the unenhanced scar, which enhances late.
FNH contains both Kupffer cells and bile duct epithelium: can confirm Kupffer cells via sulfur colloid scan (&#8531; of cases) and bile duct cells via HIDA scan.

cut grapefruit, STEALTH, uniform art +C, T2 bright scar +C delay

Hypo/Hyper. Variable on diffusion. Central scar
Norml hepatocytes w disfunctional bile ducts

iso, hyper or hypo (has kupffer, vascularity etc)- also has biliary ducts so will be hyper on HIDA

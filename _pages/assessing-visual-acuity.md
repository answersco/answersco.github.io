title: "Assessing visual acuity"
---
-examines pt's ability to see at a distance and at range; also assess the pt's cranial nerve II which is the optic nerve; also look at central vision
-near vision: reading material from about 14 inches away with adequate lighting
-far-sighted vision: use Snellen Chart; standing about 20 feet away and cover one eye and read the lowest line and then switch eyes (20/40: what I am reading at 20 feet, I can read what a normal person can read at 40 feet)

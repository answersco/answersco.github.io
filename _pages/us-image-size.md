title: "US image size:"
---
Bits are grouped into bytes&#8594; every 8 bits is grouped into one byte.
Pixel depth for an US image:
B-mode and M-mode images&#8594; usually 8 bits (256 gray levels)
&#8594; pixel depth of 1 byte for B- and M-mode images
Color Doppler images&#8594; usually 24 bits.
&#8594; pixel depth of 3 bytes for color Doppler.
Matrix size = the total # of pixels per image
 For an US image&#8594; matrix size usually 512 x 512
Image size = matrix size x pixel depth
Most commonly described in megabytes (MB)
1 MB = 220 bytes

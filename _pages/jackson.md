title: "Jackson"

attempt case illustrating MPC's substantial step test; here it's about culpability for completed crime + substantial step showing firmness/strongly corroborative of of defendant's criminal intent; almost the same facts as Rizzo but opposite outcome; convictions affirmed b/c defendants would have committed crimes if they hadn't been dissuaded by FBI intervention; it was more than just preparation

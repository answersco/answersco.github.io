title: "NUMERS: What is normal msec for TI for nulling myocardium? What if abnormally long TI to null myocardium?"
---
- Myocardium usually 200- 330 msec TI, but highly variable 
- in AMYLOID, the myocardium is difficult to suppress (may need TI as long as 350 msec, usually just ~200 ms); blood pool is DARKER than the myocardium

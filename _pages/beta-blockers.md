title: "Beta blockers"
---
-selective is always better if possible bc when nonselective it can cause bronchoconstriction
-check HR and BP before and during treatment
-if less than 60 HR then withhold meds
-avoid abrupt cessation from medication bc it can cause reflex tachycardia and HT
EX. atenolol and metoprolol: both selective beta 1 blocker that causes decreased HR, decreased electrical activity, decreased in secretion of renin in the kidneys

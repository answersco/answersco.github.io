title: "NM prosthesis evaluation"

Difficult to distinguish aseptic loosening from infection

Bone scan can be nonspecific because there can be increased periprosthetic uptake in a hip up to 1 year after prosthesis placement (longer for cementless arthroplasty)

Tc-MDP usually shows diffusely increased activity with infection, though this is also nonspecific.
-Combined Tc-SC and WBC imaging needed to confirm.

Loosening more commonly shows more focal uptake along the stem and lesser trochanter.

Negative bone scan excludes loosening or infection.

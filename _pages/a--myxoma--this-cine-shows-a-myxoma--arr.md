title: "A. Myxoma. This cine shows a myxoma (arrow) within the left atrium that is partially prolapsing through the mitral valve. Myxomas are most often located in the left atrium, often pedunculated, and commonly attached to the interatrial septum. When large, they can obstruct the mitral valve and cause symptoms of mitral stenosis. Myxomas are well encapsulated unlike angiosarcomas which are a malignant tumor and are very invasive. A lipoma should have the same signal as subcutaneous fat, therefore it would be much brighter than this mass. This would be an unusual location for an intracardial thrombus, which typically form in areas of minimal motion."

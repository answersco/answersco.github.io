-blocks both K+ and Na+ channels
-if someone has a dysrhythmia on like a-fib or v-fib, they will get a loading dose IV and hang an IV drip to keep heart calm and maintain keeping arrhythmia away then get switched over to PO
-has a very long half-life
-there are levels that should be checked as well: therapeutic (0.5-2.5 mg/mL)
-like Ca++ blockers, you need to avoid grapefruit which could increase levels of amiodarone in the blood
-b/c this med delays repolarization, each shift if required to measured the QT interval - a wide QT interval which can be indicative that their levels are too high

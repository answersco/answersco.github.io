Slice pitch or detector pitch (in multi-detector scanners) = ratio of pitch to the slice thickness (S) 
Slice pitch = (table movement per tube revolution) / (slice thickness)
= d/S
Slice thickness = beam width
Beam pitch &#8594; Collimation must be set so that the beam is wide enough to cover all the slices
Thus, for an N-slice scan, the beam pitch = N x slice thickness &#8594; 
Thus, slice pitch = N x beam pitch.
Per article&#8594; beam pitch = table movement per rotation / (N x T)
N = # of slices; T = slice thickness

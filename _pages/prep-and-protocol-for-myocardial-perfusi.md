title: "Prep and protocol for myocardial perfusion"
---
No food for 4 hours (decreases GI blood flow)
Ideally stop beta blockers, CCBs, and long-acting nitrates for 24 hours (mess with stress sensitivity)

Protocols:
-2 day exams: rest then stress
-1 day exam: stress than rest (can stop if normal)
-Chemical stress: regadenoson (adenosine receptor agonist)= less bronchospasm than conventional adenosine or dipyridamole.

title: "Death of a cell"
---
-mitosis and apoptosis work together to form a functional body
1) death receptors on doomed cells binds to signal molecule and caspases are activated within
2) caspases destroy various proteins and other cell components; cell undulates
3) dying cell forms blebs
4) phagocyte attacks and engulfs cell fragments; cell components are degraded

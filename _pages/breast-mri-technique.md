Technique: performed with the patient prone, using a dedicated breast coil
Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) are obtained using fat saturation (usually 3D FS spoiled gradient-echo T1W images)
Intraductal fluid may by T1-hyperintense&#8594; complicates evaluation of enhancement &#8594; requires post-processing.
Post-processing:
Simplest form is subtraction&#8594; dynamic post-contrast images are subtracted from the initial T1W fat-saturated images.
MIP&#8594; based on subtraction images
Highlights the brightest pixel along each parallel ray to create a volumetric data set where the enhancement can be easily seen in the 3D space.
Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) &#8594; helpful adjunct for analysis of contrast-enhanced MRI sequences
Allows creation of a color angio-map&#8594; colors correspond to different temporal patterns of enhancement.

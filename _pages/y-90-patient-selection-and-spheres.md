title: "Y-90 patient selection and spheres"
---
Most patients who can undergo TACE can potentially undergo TARE. 
-Portal and hepatic vein invasion are not considered contraindications to TARE provided shunt fraction is acceptable.

Radioactive spheres are not radiopaque and should not be mixed with contrast or lipiodol, making visualization of embolization difficult
-Glass spheres: entire dose usually delivered without interruption because embolic load is low
-Resin spheres: intermittent injection of contrast is necessary because embolic load is high and stasis or even reflux can occur before entire dose is delivered. Spheres must be carefully flushed through catheter before contrast can be injected.

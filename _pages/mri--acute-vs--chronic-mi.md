title: "MRI: acute vs. chronic MI"

Both have delayed enhancement
If the MI was transmural and chronic, you may have thinned myocardium.
Acute will have normal thickness
T2 signal from edema may be increased in acute.
No microvascular obstruction in chronic
Acute is T2 bright (edema); chronic is T2 dark (scar).

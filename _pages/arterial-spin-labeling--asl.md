title: "Arterial spin labeling (ASL)"
---
Non-contrast MRI technique where endogenous blood in the arterial supply is saturated or labeled and then allowed to perfuse the tissue in the imaging slice.
A 2nd scan is acquired at the same location with unlabeled blood protons.
Small signal loss in the images with the labeled blood- the difference image between the labeled and unlabeled scans will be proportional to the CBF.

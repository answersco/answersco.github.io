title: "IMPORTANT: Which has a higher target:background ratio, DTPA or MAG3? Why?"
---
Background signal is due to extravascular distribution

MAG3 has a much higher target:background ratio because 90% is bound intravascularly to protein, preventing it from going into the extra-vascular space and contributing to background signal

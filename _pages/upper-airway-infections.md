1) Rhinitis

2) Rhinosinusitis: loss of cartilage

3) Pharyngitis

4) Tonsillitis / Adenoiditis: restriction in airways

5) Peritonsillar abscess: restriction in airways

6) Laryngitis - secondary to GERD; keep HOB elevated and give H2 blockers and PTIs??

7) Decreased muscle mass and thinning mucus membranes which contribute to voice changes and the quivery voice

**-older adults have more significant effects from URIs - typically use antihistamines and decongestants which effect other meds they are on (watch BPs, safety issues)

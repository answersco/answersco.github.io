title: "How are catheters and sheaths sized?"
---
3 French = 1 mm
Diameter in mm = Fr/3

French size = EXTERNAL diameter of a catheter (not the caliber of the lumen)

Sheaths: sized according to the largest catheter they can accommodate - size given for INNER lumen
-The outer diameter of a sheath is ~1.5-2 French larger than the sheath &quot;size&quot;

Standard sizes:
6-8F for most routine vascular work
Stent grafts need 15-20F
PEG = 24F

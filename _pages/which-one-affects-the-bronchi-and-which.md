title: "Which one affects the bronchi and which affects the trachea? (adenoid cystic vs mucoepidermoid) How else to tell apart?"
---
Adenoid Cystic = Thoracic Trachea
&quot;Trachea is closer to your &quot;adenoids&quot;
- Surgery + Radiation
* Tends to EXTEND into Mediastinum

Mucoepidermoid = Bronchi
&quot;more mucous at the bronchi!&quot;
- Does NOT tend to extend into mediastinum
- if low grade, then cured after local excision

title: "MS versus ADEM in cord"
---
MS in the Cord: typically short segment (&lt;2)
Commonly only half/part of the cord
Not typically enlarged
Can enhance or restrict when acute
Cord atrophy with large lesion burden
90% with brain lesions

ADEM: after viral infection in child or young adult
Favor dorsal white matter, but may involve grey matter
Presence of cranial nerve enhancement suggests ADEM
Usually not enlarged
Usually have brain lesions (including basal ganglia and pons, which are uncommon in MS)

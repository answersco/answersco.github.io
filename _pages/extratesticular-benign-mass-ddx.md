Adenomatoid Tumor.&#8212;Adenomatoid tumors 
represent 30% of all extratesticular masses; 
only lipoma is more common. An adenomatoid 
tumor is a benign neoplasm that originates in the 
epididymis, most commonly in the tail. Adeno- 
matoid tumors can occasionally occur in the sper- 
matic cord or testicular tunica and can extend 
into the testis, mimicking a germ cell tumor (14). 
DDX: Spermatic cord lipoma
DDX: Fibrous pseudotumor is the third most common extratesticular mass after lipoma and adenomatoid tumor. 
Fibrous pseudotumors are not true neoplasms 
but represent benign reactive fibrous prolifera- 
tion that results in one or several paratesticular 
nodules, usually arising from the tunica vagina- 
lis. Fibrous pseudotumors have been reported 
that were as large as 8 cm in greatest diameter. 
They are likely related to prior inflammation, 
with 50% having an associated hydrocele and 
30% of patients having a history of trauma or 
epididymo-orchitis. Fibrous pseudotumors can 
dislodge and become freely mobile, resulting in 
a &quot;scrotal pearl.&quot;
Polyorchidism.&#8212;Polyorchidism is a developmen- 
tal anomaly that possibly is due to division of the 
genital ridge by peritoneal bands. Forty percent 
of cases occur in the setting of cryptorchidism, 
and 15% are complicated by testicular torsion 
that is due to the mobility of the supernumerary 
testes (20). Polyorchidism manifests as a painless 
extratesticular scrotal mass or masses that appear 
similar in echogenicity to the testis at US and are 
identical in signal intensity characteristics to the 
normal testis on MR images, having intermedi- 
ate T1 and high T2 signal intensity (Fig 8). A

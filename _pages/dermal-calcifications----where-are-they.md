title: "Dermal calcifications: - where are they seen - what is the buzzword sign? - what special view can you use?"
---
seen where women sweat (folds, cleavage, axilla)
- &quot;tattoo sign&quot; stay in the same place on CC and MLO view
- for confirmation, can use &quot;tangential view&quot;

- these calcs typically have a lucent center (look like RBCs)

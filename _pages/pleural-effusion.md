Fluid in the pleural cavity. In an upright film this is usually seen in the bases. When fluid amount reaches approximately 200 cc the costophrenic angle is no longer sharp and becomes blunted, hence the term &quot;blunting&quot;. As fluid increase in amount it tracks along the chest wall (meniscus sign) due to negative intrapleural pressure and to a lesser degree surface tension. Free flowing effusions to layer out when patient placed on side (decubitus film). Septae may develop when effusions are complicated leading to a loculated (in compartments) fluid that does not layer out. Hemothorax is frank blood in the pleural cavity. When blood mixes with pleural fluid it leads to a hemorrhagic effusion. Pus in the pleural cavity is called empyema. A mixture of fluid and air leads to a pneumohydrothorax.

Pleural effusions are usually first seen on Lateral views. Takes a few hundred cc's to be seen on PA film. MD may do a lateral Decubitus view with the side of the effusion down on table.

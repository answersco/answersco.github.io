title: "MRI of the prostate and anatomy:"
---
MRI of the prostate: 2 components of the gland can be resolved on MRI
Peripheral zone: 70% of adenocarcinomas from peripheral zone
Central gland: refers to both the central zone and the transition zone, which cannot be distinguished on MRI
Transition zone: site of BPH
Enlarges as the patient ages, and makes up most of the central gland in older patients.
MRI is able to clearly delineate the prostatic zonal anatomy (central gland versus peripheral zone) using T2W sequences with an endorectal coil
Inappropriate for screening due to cost and low sensitivity/specificity

Cryptogenic organizing PNA (COP): clinical syndrome of organizing PNA (OP) without a known cause. 
Clinical syndrome of COP was previously called BOOP
COP responds well to steroids with good prognosis&#8594; may resolve completely, though recurrences are common.
OP may be a response to infection, drug reaction, or inhalation.
CT: mixed consolidation and GGO in a peripheral and peribronchovascular distribution.
Reverse halo (atoll) sign: relatively specific for OP, featuring central lucency surrounded by a ground-glass halo.
Not to be confused with halo sign of invasive aspergillus (central opacity with peripheral ground-glass).

title: "Afterload"
---
resistance to left ventricular ejection - the work the heart must overcome to eject blood

-what comes after the heart that the heart has to overcome in order to eject the blood, what the heart is working against
-when vascularity is contracted, increases afterload but is a bad thing bc it is the work your heart has to work against to eject the blood

-sum of all forces opposing ejection of blood from ventricle
-largest part of afterload is blood pressure in aorta and pulmonary trunk which opposes the opening of semilunar valves and limits stroke volume
-hypertension increases afterload and opposes ventricular ejection
-anything that impedes arterial circulation can also increase afterload such as lung diseases that restrict pulmonary circulation

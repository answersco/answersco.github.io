Paget-Schroetter syndrome (subclavian vein compression): compression and thrombosis of the subclavian vein as it enters the thorax. Chronic compression leads to intimal hyperplasia and subsequent thrombosis.
Usually seen in muscular young men, presenting with UE swelling or pain worsened with effort
Diagnostic venography: must evaluate arm both in neutral position and abducted. Both sides should be evaluated, even in absence of contralateral symptoms.
Treatment: thrombolysis, followed by surgical thoracic outlet decompression.
If there is residual stenosis following thrombolysis, surgical decompression should generally be performed prior to angioplasty.
If preprocedure imaging demonstrates no mechanical cause, then angioplasty can be performed.
Stents should generally not be used due to high risk of failure

SPL / 2

The actual SPL is about 2-3 wavelengths long

Higher frequency probes have shorter wavelength and therefore shorter SPL, which leads to higher resolution but poor penetration.

Lower frequency probes have longer wavelength and longer SPL, which leads to higher penetration but poor axial resolution

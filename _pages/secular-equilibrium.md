Parent T1/2 is much longer than child T1/2, ie Radon (1620 y) and Radium (4.8d). What this means is that the activity of Radium won't change much over time in a sealed container.

This occurs when the rate of production of a daughter compound is negated by its decay
This typically happens at approximately 7 daughter t1/2
Typically the parent will have a VERY long t1/2 (100X greater than daughter)

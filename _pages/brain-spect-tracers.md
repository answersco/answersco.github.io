TcHMPAO and ECD: both can be used in dementia imaging and for seizure focus localization (administer within 30 seconds of seizure), as well as for blood flow

HMPAO: neutral and lipophilic
-Accumulates in cortex proportional to blood flow (gray matter &gt; WM)
-WASHOUT IS FAST
-Uptake favors frontal lobe, thalamus, and cerebellum

ECD: neutral and lipophilic
-Accumulates in cortex proportional to blood flow (GM &gt; WM)
-SLOWER WASHOUT (more rapid clearance from blood pool)
-Better background clearance
-Uptake favors parietal and occipital lobes (makes comparison between HMPAO and ECD difficult).
-Does not undergo intracerebral redistribution

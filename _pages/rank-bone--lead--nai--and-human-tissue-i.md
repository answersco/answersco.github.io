title: "Rank bone, lead, NaI, and human tissue in terms of increasing amount of Compton scatter per unit mass of material for 100 kV x-rays."

Answer: there is no appreciable difference in Compton scattering for any of the absorbing materials.
The probability of Compton scattering is dependent upon the # of electrons in the absorbing material, which, in turn, depends on the density of the absorber and the # of electrons per unit mass. For most elements except hydrogen, the # of electrons per unit mass is approximately the same; hence the probability of Compton scatter is independent of the atomic # of the absorbing material.

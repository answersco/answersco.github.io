title: "Slice select gradients are almost always used when a RF pulse is applied. What are instances where an RF pulse may be used without a slice select gradient?"
---
Examples of instances when an rf-pulse is applied without a slice select gradient include chemical saturation, the excitation pulse for some 3D sequences, and the initial 180 inversion pulse for double and triple inversion recovery sequences used in cardiac imaging.

Early subacute infarct (1.5-5 days)
Continued &#8593; vasogenic edema and mass effect (peak 3-4 days)
Marked T2 hyperintensity in gray and white matter (versus acute, which usually just involves gray matter)
ADC becomes less dark or even resolves, but DWI remains bright (T2 shine-through)
Continued expansion of infarct core and reduction of penumbra on perfusion.

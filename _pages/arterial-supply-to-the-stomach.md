title: "Arterial supply to the stomach"
---
Supplied by numerous arteries, all of which communicate.

L gastric (usually 1st branch of celiac): supplies GEJx, fundus, and part of lesser curve.
The lateral fundus is also supplied by short and posterior gastric arteries from the splenic artery and splenic hilum.

Body of stomach: supplied by gastroepiploic artery, located along greater curvature. It has origins from the gastroduodenal and distal splenic artery.
Lesser curvature of body of stomach: supplied by branches from the R and L gastric arteries. The R gastric artery usually arises from the left or common hepatic arteries. 

Antrum and pylorus: supplied by right gastroepiploic and R gastric arteries, and often pancreaticoduodenal arteries (from gastroduodenal)

title: "UAE success and comparison to surgery"
---
Embolized fibroids shrink an average of 50-60% in volume, with satisfactory results in 85-90% (slightly more for bleeding and pain, slightly less for bulk symptoms).
Wider range of success for patients treated primarily for adenomyosis (65-90%).
25-30% of patients will require an additional intervention to achieve sustained clinical success.
Recurrent symptoms: can be due to incomplete embo, collateral supply from gonadal or accessory uterine arteries, development of new fibroids, and coexistent pathology such as adenomyosis or endometriosis.

Compared to surgery, UAE has demonstrated equivalent initial clinical outcomes, faster recovery, but significantly higher incidence of reintervention directly related to fibroids.

HIFU can also effectively ablate fibroid tissue using MRI guidance.

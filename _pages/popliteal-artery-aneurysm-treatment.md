title: "Popliteal artery aneurysm treatment"
---
Pop aneurysms require treatment before development of symptoms.
-Surgical excision and bypass was traditional tx for all symptomatic aneurysms and asymptomatic lesions &gt; 2 cm.

-Stent-grafts are increasingly being used to exclude popliteal artery aneurysms. 
-Adequate segments of normal artery are necessary proximal and distal to the aneurysm.
-Stent graft must cross the knee joint, so a flexible, compressible device is necessary.

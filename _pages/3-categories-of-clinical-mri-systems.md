title: "3 categories of clinical MRI systems:"
---
Low-field systems &#8594; B0 &lt; 0.5 T
Have larger bore sizes and can permit larger patient weight limits &#8594; advantage for large patients.
Also permit open design variety &#8594; allows shifting the patient sideways to bring imaged anatomy closer to the magnet's isocenter.
Mid-field systems&#8594; B0 between 0.5 T and 1.0 T
High-field systems&#8594; B0 &gt; 1.5 T
Offer better resolution, predominantly due to &#8593; SNR
Generation of high magnetic fields over a large volume is challenging &#8594; thus these tend to have smaller bore sizes than with low-field systems.

title: "First pass effect"
---
-a phenomenon of drug metabolism whereby the concentration of a drug is greatly reduced before it reaches the systemic circulation
-liver takes a percentage of the medication during the process 
-drugs absorbed from GI tract and pass through portal vein to liver before entering systemic circulation therefore a portion of the drug is lost due to liver processes
-drugs given by parenteral route are not affected by first pass effect bc it is not going through the GI system

title: "Why do you need the 180 refocusing pulse in SE sequences?"
---
The refocusing pulse will create phase coherence at time TE, correcting for dephasing from extrinsic and intrinsic field inhomogeneities, as well as for out of phase effects from chemical shift. Thus, the residual signal at time TE is determined by T2 decay, rather than T2* decay.

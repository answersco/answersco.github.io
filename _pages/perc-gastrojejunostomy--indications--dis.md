title: "Perc gastrojejunostomy: indications, disadvantages"
---
Main indication: previous history of reflux or aspiration.
Generally should place gastrostomy tubes initially unless there is history of aspiration, large hiatal hernia, or poor pulmonary status, in which case perc gastrojejunostomy can be performed de novo.

Disadvantages:
-Can be more technically challenging and tedious because the catheter has to be negotiated past pylorus and duodenum into jejunum.
-Totally different feeding regimen than for G-tube, which uses bolus feeds. Bolus feeding can't be used for J-tubes because severe diarrhea will ensue. Slower drip feeding used for J-tubes, leading to prolonged feeding times and increased nursing care.

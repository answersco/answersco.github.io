title: "CTDI measurements, DLP, effective dose"
---
CTDI: dose normalized to beam width
-Weighted CTDA: &#8531; the central CTDI + &#8532; the peripheral CTDI (given in mGy)
-Volume CTDI: CTDIweighted / pitch

DLP = CTDIvol x length of scan in cm

Effective Dose for CT: given in Sv
Effective dose = k x DLP (k is body-part specific)

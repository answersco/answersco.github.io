Step 6 of the Planned Change Process
-the activities and objectives have been outlined in the previous step
-make sure that the people affected understand and are prepared for the change (i.e. education)
-if you are planning an intervention that would include a lot of people, you may want to consider a pilot study.
-this is the intervention or teaching that is done on a smaller scale, with less people to see how the education worked.
-this is helpful to the educator, because it may help them to work out any kinks or problems with the program.

title: "RFA applicators and effects on ablation zone"
---
3 general types of RF applicators: single straight needles, cluster straight needles, and multitined expandable electrodes.
-Major difference between the applicators is the size of ablation zone possible during a single treatment session.
-Max achievable uniform ablation zone with a single straight electrode is ~ 1.6 cm in vivo.

Methods to increase ablation zones include: 
-Internally cooled applicators-prevent char and vaporization for larger ablation zone.
-Cluster electrodes-3 cm ablation diameter
-Umbrella-style expandable array electrode-5-6 cm ablation zones via 3 electrode needles in 1 applicator
-Simultaneous use of multiple single probe applicators placed at different locations in the tumor.
-Interstitial saline infusion- spreads thermal energy more efficiently while increasing tissue ionicity, allowing for greater flow of current.

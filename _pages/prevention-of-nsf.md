Avoiding or severely limiting administration of gadolinium to patients with eGFR &gt; 30 ml/min or with AKI. Screening with eGFR recommended within 6 weeks for patients with history of renal disease, over 60 years, or history of HTN or DM.
In patients with less severe stage 3 CKD (3A, eGFR 45-59), lowest possible dose is recommended. For patients in stage 3B (eGFR 30-44, greater precautions needed).

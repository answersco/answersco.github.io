title: "Typical tube voltage in fluoro/IR"
---
X-ray tube voltage (kVp) for fluoro/IR&#8594; typically 60-120 kVp
Every 15% &#8593; in kVp roughly doubles # of x-rays produced.
Use of &#8593; kVp&#8594; &#8595; iodine contrast
Maximum iodine contrast would occur if all of the x-ray energy were just above the 33.2 keV k-edge of iodine.
Iodine contrast is optimal when using 60-80 kVp, but high kVp may be necessary to penetrate a large patient.

title: "Metal biliary stent occlusion: causes and management"
---
Average patency rate for metallic stents in the biliary tree is ~ 6 months.

Causes:
-Tumor overgrowth at upper or lower end of stent
-Tumor ingrowth through the wire mesh of the stent
-Occlusive debris clogging the stent.

Overgrowth: prevented by overstenting
-For tumor overgrowth above the stent, PTC can be performed and a guidewire manipulated through stent into duodenum. 
-The tumor above the stent can be dilated, and a second Wallstent inserted in a sleeved fashion through the 1st Wallstent.

Tumor ingrowth:
-Can be managed with balloon dilatation of the 1st stent in the region of tumor ingrowth, followed by placement of a 2nd stent.

Stent occlusion with debris or sludge: 
-Can be managed by manipulated a guidewire down through the lumen of the occluded stent and using a balloon catheter to sweep the stent clear of debris.

ERCP can also be used for stent occlusion.

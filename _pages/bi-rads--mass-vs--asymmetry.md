title: "BI-RADS: mass vs. asymmetry"
---
Mass: a 3D structure demonstrating convex-outward borders, usually evident on 2 orthogonal views. No size limit for mass.
Asymmetry: a finding only seen on 1 view.
Focal asymmetry: small focal area of tissue on MM (&lt;1 quadrant) lacking convex borders, conspicuity, and 3-dimensionality of a mass. It is seen on 2 views and may or may not be found to represent a mass on diagnostic work-up. 
Global asymmetry: regional or diffuse increase in fibroglandular tissue density in one breast compared to a similar area in the opposite breast. &gt;/= 1 quadrant, and seen on 2 views.

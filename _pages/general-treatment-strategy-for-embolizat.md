title: "General treatment strategy for embolization in hepatic trauma"

Angiogram should include at minimum celiac artery, proper hepatic artery, and SMA injections with rapid initial filming and slower filming through the portal phase

Intrahepatic arteries are not end arteries, but have potential collateral supply from other intrahepatic arteries.
Occlusion proximal to the injury may result in persistent bleeding due to distal reconstitution of the artery.
When possible, the artery on both sides of a focal abnormality should be occluded.
Coils can be used for selective embo, but particles may be necessary when injury is diffuse or selection is not possible owing to complex anatomy.

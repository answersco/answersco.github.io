title: "Line Focus Principle?"
---
To spread out heat, the focal spot needs to be as large as possible. But to reduce geometric blur, the focal spot needs to be as small as possible. Both can be accomplished by using a beveled anode surface. For a given actual focal spot, the smaller the anode angle, the smaller the apparent focal spot. In the plane of the image receptor, the apparent focal spot is smallest on the anode side of image center, and appears larger near the cathode side.

Beam smaller than target material

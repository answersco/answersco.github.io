title: "Sizing of balloon-expandable and self-expanding stents"
---
Balloon-expandable: deploy from both ends toward the middle
-Sized in same manner as angioplasty balloons, up to 5-10% greater in diameter than the measured normal lumen.
-Shorten slightly during expansion in proportion to the final diameter (much more if significantly overdilated stent).

Self-expanding: typically deploy from distal to proximal relative to operator.
-Unconstrained diameter of stent should be 10-20% larger than the normal diameter of the target vessel.
-Usually constrained by an outer sleeve or membrane.
-Do not necessarily require the protection of a long sheath or guiding catheter to advance through a lesion, but predilation of the lesion is useful.
-Radioopacity of stent is crucial.
-Variable shortening depending on design (least for laser-cut nitinol).

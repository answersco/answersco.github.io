title: "Gibbs truncation or Ringing artifact or just Truncation"
---
Seen as bright or dark lines parallel and adjacent to borders of distinct intensity change.
-seen when a small matrix is used, incompletely digitizing the echo by the end of the acquisition.
- a fourier processing problem - impossible to completely get rid of
FIX:
-INCREASE PE steps 
-DECREASE PIXEL SIZE - Reduce the FOV (aka increase Matrix)
- apply a pre/post reconstruction filtration
A truncation Artifact can mimic a syrinx (Elongated cyst) in the cervical spine.

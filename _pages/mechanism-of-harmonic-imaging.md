US beam is progressively distorted, primarily in the central portion where the intensity is high. 
A distorted pulse gives rise to distorted echoes &#8594; these have significant energy at harmonic frequencies

Tissue harmonics: made using the 2nd harmonic component of the echo signal, with the fundamental frequency excluded.
Undistorted echoes coming from lower intensity areas (fringes of the beam, side-lobes, superficial tissues) are not seen.

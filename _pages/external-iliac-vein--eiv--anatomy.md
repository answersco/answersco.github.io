title: "External iliac vein (EIV) anatomy"
---
Begins at inguinal ligament as direct continuation of drainage of LE blood
Small contributions from:
Anterior abdominal wall (through inferior epigastric veins)
Pelvis (through circumflex iliac and pubic veins).

EIV may have a single valve
R EIV is initially located medial to EIA, but crosses posterior to EIA before joining IIV
L EIV remains medial to artery throughout its length

title: "Circumstances in which CM warming may and may not be indicated:"
---
Extrinsic warming of iodinated CM to human body temperature (37&#8451;) may be helpful to minimize complications and improve vascular opacification in the following circumstances:
For high-rate (&gt; 5mL/s) IV LOCM power injections
For infections of viscous iodinated CM (e.g. iopamidol 370)
For direct arterial injections through small-caliber catheters (5 Fr or smaller)
For IV injected arterial studies in which timing and peak enhancement are critical features.
Extrinsic warming of iodinated CM may not be needed or beneficial in the following circumstances:
For low-rate (&lt; 5 mL/s) IV LOCM power injections or hand injections
For injections of iodinated CM with a relatively low viscosity (e.g. iopamidol 300)
For direct arterial injections through large-bore catheters (&gt; 6 Fr)
For IV injections in which peak opacification and timing are not critical (e.g. routine PV-phase CT CAP)

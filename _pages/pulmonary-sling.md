title: "Pulmonary sling"
---
Left PA arising from Right PA coursing between the trachea and esophagus creates the sling. Assoicated with tracheal stenosis due to complete cartilaginous rings.

Dx?

This is the only anomaly that that causes an anterior and a posterior impression
What is it: this is an aberrant LEFT pulmonary artery (its a PULMONARY sling)
Associations: Tracheal stenosis

LPA comes off RPA, squeezing between esophagus and trachea

-Origin of left pulmonary artery has distal origin from main pulmonary artery and courses sharply to left
-Passes between trachea and esophagus
-Associated with long-segment tracheal narrowing (narrowing due to complete tracheal rings and anomalous tracheal branching)
-Esophagram: Only vascular ring that leads to an anterior indentation on the esophagus

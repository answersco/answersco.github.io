title: "What is a Jefferson fracture? what is the mechanism? what is the stability? what is the concern with these fractures?"
---
-compression fracture of the bony ring of C1

-mechanism: axial blow to apex forcing occipital condyles into lateral masses of C1 (dive into pool)

-stability: unstable but pts usually don't have neurological deficits but they could if it moved the wrong way

-concern: assess for C2 fracture or artery injury b/c arteries go along the spine so fracture where foramen is could injure artery

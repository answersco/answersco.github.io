title: "Findings with hyperacute and acute rejection, reperfusion injury"
---
Hyperacute (&gt;24 hours): rapid and often fatal
Massive homogeneous infiltration

Acute (8 days-2 months): GGO and intralobular septal thickening (No GGO = no rejection). Improves with steroids.

Reperfusion injury (peaks at day 4): non-cardiogenic edema that improves usually by day 7.

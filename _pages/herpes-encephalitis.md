title: "Herpes encephalitis:"
---
Herpes encephalitis&#8594; reactivation of HSV-1 within the trigeminal ganglion.
Common fever, AMS.
Causes edema, hemorrhage, and necrosis, typically in the medial temporal lobes and inferior frontal lobes.
CT&#8594; often normal, but may show ill-defined hypoattenuation in the affected regions.
MRI&#8594; typically shows bilateral (but usually asymmetric) T2-prolongation in the medial temporal lobe, insular cortex, cingulate gyrus, and inferior frontal lobes.
Once the infection becomes hemorrhagic, MRI will show foci of T1 shortening and gradient susceptibility.
Affected areas typically demonstrate restricted diffusion.
Enhancement may develop later in the infection, and is typically gyral morphology.
Differential diagnosis of medial temporal lobe lesions&#8594; includes MCA infarction, limbic encephalitis, and seizure-related changes.

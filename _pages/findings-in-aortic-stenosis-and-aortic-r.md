title: "Findings in aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation:"
---
Aortic stenosis: 
Causes LV hypertrophy, but the heart size does not change.
Ascending aorta usually enlarged in long-standing aortic stenosis.
Pulmonary vascularity typically normal.

Aortic regurgitation:
Long-standing aortic regurgitation causes LV enlargement, which is apparent on XR as cardiomegaly.
There is typically enlargement of the ascending aorta.
Pulmonary vasculature is usually normal (similar to aortic stenosis).

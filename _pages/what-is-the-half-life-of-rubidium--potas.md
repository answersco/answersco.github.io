title: "What is the half life of rubidium (potassium analogue used in cardiac imaging)?"
---
75 seconds (myocardium rapidly takes it up - so good for assessing cardiac perfusion; and short half life allows it to be used in sequential studies every 5 minutes - but WORSE spatial resolution than PET because it travels further)

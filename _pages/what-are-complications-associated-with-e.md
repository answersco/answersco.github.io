title: "What are complications associated with ectopic testicle?"
---
The major complications of cryptorchism are malignant degeneration, infertility, torsion, and bowel incarceration because of an associated indirect inguinal hernia.

Risk of carcinoma increases with degree of ectopy, with intraabdominal testes at greatest risk. Seminoma greatest in non-orchypexy and MGCT in corrected.

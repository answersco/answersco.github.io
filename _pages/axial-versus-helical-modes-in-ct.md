title: "Axial versus helical modes in CT"
---
Axial: table stationary
Better spatial resolution in the z-direction since full image-sets are taken.
No partial volume effect along the long axis

Helical: table moves at constant speed, with tube on continuously.
Much faster than axial CT
Post-acquisition flexibility in the selection of slice location and lower probability of anatomic discontinuities between adjacent slices containing moving anatomy in chest/abdomen.
Artifacts of partial volume with helical CT are more pronounced along a curved surface (e.g. skull)

Allie baked a berry pie. The recipe called for 7 ounces of blackberries, 7 ounces of raspberries, and 6 ounces of strawberries. In the supermarket, she only found 12-ounce containers of berries. She bought 1 container of each kind of berry. After she baked the pie, how many ounces of berries did Allie have left?

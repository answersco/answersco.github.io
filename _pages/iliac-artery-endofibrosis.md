title: "Iliac artery endofibrosis"
---
Rare condition manifesting as unilateral (85%) or bilateral EIA stenoses in young athletes.
May be linked to repetitive motion of legs while flexed at hips, such as cycling.
lesions are fibrotic in nature and usually only produce a gradient during extreme exercise.
Difficult dx because the arteries may appear normal on imaging unless maximal provocative maneuvers are used.
Mgmt usually behavior modification or surgical (endarterectomy with patch angioplasty), less likely stent placement. Angioplasty alone usually unsuccessful.

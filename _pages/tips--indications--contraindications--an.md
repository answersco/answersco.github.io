title: "TIPS: indications, contraindications, and basics"

TIPS:
Indications: variceal hemorrhage that can't be controlled endoscopically, refractory ascites or hepatic hydrothorax, Budd-Chiari syndrome (HV thrombosis).
Controversial indications: hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease, bridge to transplantation.
Assessment of hepatic dysfunction performed pre-procedure:
Child-Pugh classification: combines lab values (INR, bilirubin, albumin) with clinical assessment (ascites and hepatic encephalopathy)
Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD): combines INR, bilirubin, and creatinine in complex logarithmic formula.
&#8593; MELD correlates with &#8593; post-TIPS mortality.
Absolute contraindications:
Right-sided heart failure&#8594; will be worsened with TIPS due to &#8593; right-sided venous pressures.
Severe active hepatic failure&#8594; the post-TIPS shunting of blood beyond the hepatic sinusoids can worsen liver function further.
Basics: usually the right HV is connected to the R PV with a covered stent
Right HV has relatively constant anatomy and tends to be larger than the left.
After the RHV is cannulated, wedged balloon CO2 occlusion venography is performed and the PV is retrogradely opacified.
CO2 is preferred contrast agent because it is 400X less viscous than iodinated contrast and is thus easily able to pass through the hepatic sinusoids.
Tract is created between the hepatic and portal circulation&#8594; sequentially dilated and stented (covered stent-graft), aiming for &#8595; of portosystemic gradient (between portal vein and IVC) to &lt; 12 mmHg.

title: "Principles of surgical asepsis"
---
-moisture may cause contamination
-always assume that an object is unsterile (check integrity of packaging and check label for expiration date)
-always face the sterile field
-only sterile to sterile; unsterile to unsterile
-keep sterile equipment above the waist
-keep sterile equipment on the top of the sterile field within 1&quot; border of the edge
-drapes hanging over the edge of the table are not sterile
-minimize air movement: may have to wear masks
-avoid reaching across a sterile field: sleeve (unsterile) could touch something or you could brush against it
-opened unused materials are no longer sterile; if not used immediately or when intended to use them
-a person who becomes contaminated must re-establish sterility: use another person who's able to remind you of sterility or when you broke it, bring another pair of sterile gloves
-sterile solution bottles opened must be marked with: date, time opened, &amp; nurse's initials
-discard sterile solutions 24-48 hours after opening.

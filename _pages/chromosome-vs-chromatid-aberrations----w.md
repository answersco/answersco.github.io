title: "Chromosome vs Chromatid Aberrations: - which occurs before DNA synthesis? - how many chromatids are broken?"
---
Chromosome Aberrations occur BEFORE DNA synthesis (early in interphase)
- BOTH chromatids are broken so each daughter will get a broken copy

Chromatid Aberrations occur AFTER DNA synthesis (occurs later)
- Only ONE chromatid is going to have a break

title: "Interpretation of testicular Na99mTcO4 study: - normal - acute (early) torsion - delayed (late) torsion - testicular abscess - acute epididymitis"
---
- Normal: symmetric low level flow to testicles

- Acute torsion: focal absence of flow to affected side (&quot;nubbin side&quot;)

- Delayed torsion: halo of increased activity, with central photopenia (pic)

- Testicular abscess: identical to delayed torsion

- Acute epididymitis: increased flow and blood pool to affected side

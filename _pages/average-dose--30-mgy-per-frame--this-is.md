title: "Average dose: 30 mGy per frame  This is 10-20 times greater than in GI flouro  Focal spot is 0.6, kvp 50-80, mA is 5 (low)  you recieve 0.1% what the patient gets at 1 meter  Pts who get 2-5 Gy should be warned to watch for burns  Pts who get &gt;5 Gy needs to be documented and the physicist should review what happened  Spatial Resolution: -in FPD the resolution depends on the size of the detector elements. This is defined as pitch -the Fill Factor is the amount of the detector element that is actually sensitive to radiation Fillfactor = Sensitive area/pitch The small the detector element the better the resolution but the less sensitive it is to radiation and so the dose usually increases."

Average dose in IR flouro?

125I, 123I, 131I, and non-radioactive iodine all participate in the organification of tyrosine within the thyroid gland.
I-131: emits both beta particles and 364 keV gamma photons (only gamma photons are used for imaging)
T1/2 = 8 days
Generator produced
Only used for therapy:
Treatment of thyroid cancer status-post thyroidectomy
Hyperthyroidism from Graves disease or multinodular gland.
I-123: decays by electron capture&#8594; produces 159 keV gamma photons
T1/2 = 13 hours
Cyclotron-produced &#8594; expensive
Administered orally.
Can image the thyroid in high detail, and can obtain thyroid uptake values.
Normal 6 hour uptake 6-18%, 25 hour 10-30% (both increased in Graves disease)
Tc-99m pertechnetate
T1/2 = 6 hours
Emits a 140 keV gamma photon
Unlike iodine, pertechnetate isn't trapped by thyroid. After initial uptake it is released into the blood pool
Thyroid uptake not routinely quantified with Tc-99m due to its rapid washout.
Provides excellent images of thyroid gland.
Because pertechnetate doesn't specifically localize to the thyroid, high background counts are typical (only 1-5% of administered activity is taken up by thyroid).
In contrast to I-123&#8594; salivary glands are clearly seen with pertechnetate
Unlike I-123, Tc-99m is administered intravenously

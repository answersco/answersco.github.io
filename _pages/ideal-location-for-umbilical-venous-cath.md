title: "Ideal location for umbilical venous catheter?"

Inferior vena cava - RA junction

An umbilical venous catheter (UVC) should course into the umbilical stump &#8594; umbilical vein &#8594; left portal vein (LPV) &#8594; ductus venosus &#8594; middle or left hepatic vein &#8594; inferior vena cava (IVC)/right atrium (RA). If it enters the superior vena cava (SVC), RA, the pulmonary outflow tract, portal venous system, or superior mesenteric vein, complications such as arrhythmia, thrombus or emboli formation, or end-organ injury may occur.

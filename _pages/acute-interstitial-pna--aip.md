Acute interstitial PNA (AIP): synonymous with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD)
Pathologic diagnosis seen in the clinical syndrome of ARDS
Only interstitial PNA with acute onset, and has worst prognosis.
Early (exudative) phase: features hyaline membranes, diffuse alveolar infiltration by immune cells, and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.
CT shows extensive geographic GGO 
Chronic (organizing) phase: features alveolar wall thickening due to granulation tissue, usually beginning 1 week after initial injury.

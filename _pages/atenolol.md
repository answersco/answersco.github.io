title: "Atenolol"
---
CLASSIFICATION: antihypertensive, selective 1 beta blocker

INDICATIONS FOR USE: hypertension, angina, acute MI

ACTION: block beta 1 receptors and decreases cardiac output and oxygen consumption and renin secretions

SIDE EFFECTS: hypotension, bradycardia, dyspnea

THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS:

NURSING ASSESSMENT: check apical pulse before giving drug and if &lt; 60 bpm withhold drug, monitor BP

WHAT TO MONITOR: may increase BUN, creatinine, glucose, LDH, K+, AST, ALT, uric acid levels, may decrease blood glucose levels, may increase platelet count

PT TEACHING: teach pt the importance of taking their pulse (if &lt; 60 bpm, call prescriber), do not stop suddenly

EVALUATION: may cause changes in exercise tolerance, monitor pt for cardiac failure, avoid disrupt discontinuation to avoid angina, MI, or ventricular arrhythmias

-selective beta1 blocker (only hits the Beta1 blockers that are in the heart)
-will slow down all activities that would usually increase in the sympathetic NS
-decreases cardiac output, decreases electrical conduction across heart, decreases heart rate, decreases oxygen consumption of the heart
-it is good bc it is selective
-can be given for HTN
-will inhibit renin release bc they block Beta1
-most selective

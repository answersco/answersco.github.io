Case-control studies: design is generally retrospective
Investigators identify a group of subjects with the disease (cases) and a group without the disease (controls) &#8594; then look back to find differences in predictor variables (risk factors) between cases and controls.
This design yields odds ratios (estimates of the strength of association between risk factors and the presence of disease)
Cannot yield prevalence or incidence of disease
Major strength: efficiency for studying rare diseases
Major weakness: susceptibility to bias, especially sampling bias and differential measurement bias (i.e. because of retrospective data)
Methods to help minimize sampling bias: using matching and hospital-based controls or disease registries.

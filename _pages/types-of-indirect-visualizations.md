1) KUB: abd x-ray (kidneys, ureter, and bladder)
2) upper gastrointestinal (UGI)/small bowel series - drink barium and then take x-ray
3) barium enema - administered rectally to look at GI tract
4) abdominal ultrasound - not used frequently for GI
5) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
6) abdominal CT scan

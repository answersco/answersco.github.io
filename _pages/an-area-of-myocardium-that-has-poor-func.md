title: "An area of myocardium that has poor function but normal perfusion is called what? A) Hibernating myocardium B) Stunned myocardium C) Microvascular obstruction D) Shocked myocardium"

B. Stunned Myocardium. When blood flow is restored to ischemic myocardium that has not yet infarcted, there is often a period of time in which this myocardium continues to be dysfunctional. This is referred to as stunned myocardium. Over time, this myocardium regains function. Hibernating myocardium is a result of chronic ischemia. As a result, the myocardium adapts by down regulating functional, and therefore metabolic, activity to preserve viability. Microvascular obstruction is the area of infarcted myocardium that receives no blood flow due to destruction of blood vessels. Shocked myocardium is not a term used in cardiac MRI.

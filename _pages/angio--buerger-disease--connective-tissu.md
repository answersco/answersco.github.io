title: "Angio: Buerger disease, connective tissue disorders, PAN"
---
Buerger disease (thromboangiitis obliterans): affects UEs in over 2/3.
-Occlusion of named arteries
-Hypertrophy of small perineural vessels and vasa vasorum (&quot;corkscrew collaterals&quot;)
-Tobacco use

SLE, scleroderma, RA, and other connective tissue disorders appear similar
-Multiple occlusions of medium to small arteries of hand, particularly in the digits, with poor collateralization
-Occlusions are usually tapered, though there may be intimal irregularity and abrupt caliber changes of patent vessels.
-Absence of intraluminal filling defects is a key feature.
-Arteries of upper arm and forearm are usually spared

Multiple small aneurysms: typical of PAN

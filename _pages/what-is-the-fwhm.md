title: "What is the FWHM?"
---
The simplest method of examining overall spatial resolution is to determine the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the line spread function. This refers to the profile response of the gamma camera to a single point source of radioactivity and reflects the number of counts seen by the crystal at different lateral distances from the source.

- The source is often placed 10 cm from the crystal for these measurements. The FWHM is expressed as the width in centi- meters at 50% of the height of the line spread peak. The narrower the peak, the better the resolution.

= Root of the sum of inherent resolution^2 + collimator resolution^2

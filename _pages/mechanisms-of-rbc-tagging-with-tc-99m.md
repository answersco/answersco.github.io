title: "Mechanisms of RBC tagging with Tc-99m"
---
Before Tc-99 can be tagged to RBC, it must first be reduced, accomplished with stannous ion (tin)

In vivo: 
1. Tin (stannous ion) injected into patient
2. Tc-99m pertechnetate injected
3. Tin binds Hgb then reduces the Tc (which then binds)
-Simple, but only gets 60-80% bound, so lots of free Tc and dirty image (poor target to background).
-May fail due to drug interaction (heparinized tubing, recent IV contrast).
-Images too poor for cardiac, but ok for GI bleeding.

In vivo-in vitro (modified in vivo)
1. Tin (stannous ion) injected into patient
2. After 15-30 min, pull 3-5 cc blood out of IV line into syringe with Tc-99m-pertechnetate and anticoagulant
3. Reinjected 10 minutes later.
-Better bindings, closer to 85%
-Drug interactions (like heparin) most common cause of failure

In vitro: 
1. Blood withdrawn and added to kit with both tin and Tc. 
2. Then reinjected.
-Most effective (98% binding) and most expensive.

title: "What are the histopath features of RDS which have radiological manifestations?"
---
Hypoventilation secondary to decreased surfactant production.
Histopath changes are alveolar collapse, interstitial thickening, bronchiolar distension. Proteinacous exudate (hyaline membranes), which is composed of necrotic cells and fibrin, is usually seen by 12-24 hours.
Immature type II alveolar cells, start surfactant production at 24wks. Surfactant lowers surface tension and prevents atelectasis.

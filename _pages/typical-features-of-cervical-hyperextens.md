title: "Typical features of cervical hyperextension versus cervical hyperflexion versus cervical hyperflexion-rotation injuries:"
---
Cervical hyperextension: typical findings include a bony defect through the posterior arch with posterior element widening. May also have widening of the anterior portion of the disc space.

Cervical hyperflexion: focal kyphosis, with widening of the posterior aspect of the disc space relative to the ventral margin. Also commonly increased space between spinous processes with widened, perched, or jumped facets. 

Cervical hyperflexion-rotation: typical findings include malalignment of adjacent facets with focal vertebral body angulation and rotation at the site of injury, involving the mid or lower cervical spine.

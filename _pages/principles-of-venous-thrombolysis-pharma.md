title: "Principles of venous thrombolysis/pharmacomechanical thrombectomy"
---
-Fresh thrombus lyses quickest
-Infuse agent over entire length of thrombus
-Establish flow quickly: consider pharmacomechanical thrombectomy first, then thrombolysis
-Anticoagulate during infusion (low dose with tissue plasminogen activators)
-Platelet inhibitors (ASA of GP-2B/3A agents)
-Stents frequently required for chronic disease
-Long-term anticoagulation

title: "Thymoma:"
---
Thymoma: most common primary tumor of anterior mediastinum, usually in middle-aged to older adults, between 45 and 60 years.
Associated with myasthenia gravis in 33% of cases (10% of MG patients have thymom)
Also associated with red cell aplasia, hypogammaglobulinemia, paraneoplastic syndromes, lymphoma, and thyroid cancer
30% are invasive&#8594; may invade adjacent structures including airways, chest wall, great vessels, and phrenic nerves.
Elevation of a hemidiaphragm: suggestive of phrenic nerve invasion
Drop metastases may occur due to spread along pleural and pericardial surfaces.
Hematogenous metastases are very rare (unlike in thymic carcinoma).

Spectrum ranging form non-invasive to invasive thymoma
Calcifications are going to make you think this is more aggressive
- Aggressive thymomas tend to eat the mediastinal fat, invade adjacent structures, and drop met
NOTE: on MRI in/out phase imaging, thymic rebound will DROP signal (it has fat) whereas thymomas will not

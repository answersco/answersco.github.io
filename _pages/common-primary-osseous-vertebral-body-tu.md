Chordoma&#8594; malignant tumor of older adults
Most commonly occurs in the sacrococcygeal region, second most commonly in clivus, and up to 15% in vertebral bodies (usually cervical).
Appears as destructive, T2-hyperintense lesion that avidly enhances.
Plasmacytoma&#8594; lytic, expansile bony lesion of late adulthood thought to represent a precursor to multiple myeloma.
Solitary lesion&#8594; if multiple, it implies diagnosis of multiple myeloma.
Chondrosarcoma&#8594; low-grade malignancy.
T2-hyperintense mass, similar to chordoma.
Chondroid ring-and-arc calcification may be present.

Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) &#8594; benign, progressively destructive lesion
Commonly have fluid levels on MRI, though this is nonspecific.
Chondroblastoma&#8594; benign, but aggressive lesion that rarely occurs in vertebral column.
May have secondary ABC.
Osteoid osteoma&#8594; benign, sclerotic lesion affecting the vertebral posterior elements in teenagers and young adults, with classic history of nocturnal pain relieved by NSAIDS.
Central radiolucent nidus.
Osteosarcoma

title: "For an object to be resolved in the axial plane using US, what separation between objects is required?"
---
The boundaries between the objects must be separated by &gt; 1/2 the spatial pulse length.
Using higher frequencies will reduce wavelength (and SPL) and thus improve axial resolution.

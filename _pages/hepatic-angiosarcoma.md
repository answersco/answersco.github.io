multiple, tend to bleed

Associated with toxic exposure: arsenic, polyvinyl chloride, XRT, and thorotrast. Also seen in hemochromatosis and NF.
Usually multifocal, and has propensity to bleed.

3 patterns
Multifocal hypervascular masses in liver &#177; spleen
May have peripheral and delayed enhancement that simulate hemangiomas
Single/multiple hepatic masses, variable necrosis
Diffuse infiltration of liver; micronodular
Often metastatic to spleen, nodes, lungs, bones
Usually T2 bright, but not as bright as hemangioma.

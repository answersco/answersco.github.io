title: "Scintillation crystal and thickness"

Once photon emerges from collimator, it impacts on the crystal
Crystal = thallium-doped sodium iodide
-When struck with a photon, it produces a pulse of light.

Thicker crystals = better sensitivity (less photons simply pass through), but worse spatial resolution

Thinner crystals: better spatial resolution, but worse sensitivity

-more prone to infections bc they were not created under sterile conditions
-have jagged or uneven edges causing it to take longer to heal

1) abrasion: rubbing or scraping of epidermal layers (scarping the knee)
2) lacerations: tearing of the skin and tissue
3) puncture wounds: when a sharp object penetrates the skin and it can take pathogens/contamination with it (dog bites)

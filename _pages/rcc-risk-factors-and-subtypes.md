title: "RCC risk factors and subtypes:"
---
RCC: risk factors include smoking, acquired cystic kidney disease, VHL, and tuberous sclerosis
Clear cell (~75% of cases): tends to enhance more avidly than the less common subtypes
Papillary: enhances only mildly due to hypovascularity
Chromophobe: best prognosis
Medullary carcinoma: mostly young adult males with sickle cell trait, and poor prognosis

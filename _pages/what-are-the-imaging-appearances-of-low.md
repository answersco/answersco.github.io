Present at birth and grow with the patient.
Similar appearnce on US with hypoechoic spaces, often with multiple septations without high flow vessels on Doppler. 

MRI, lymphatic malformations may show characteristic blood-fluid levels on T2. 

On CT or MRI: Venous malformation will show intense CENTRAL enhancement and may contain phleboliths, whereas for lymphatic malformation, only the SEPTATIONS enhance.

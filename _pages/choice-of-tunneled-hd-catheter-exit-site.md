title: "Choice of tunneled HD catheter exit site"
---
Choose an exit site several cm form entry site.
Generally a site in deltopectoral groove 3-4 cm below clavicle is best.
Later use the wire and cut the catheter by lining the wire alongside the catheter.

If the initial measurement was with the wire tip in RA, when the patient takes a deep breath under fluoro, it will simulate an upright position and bring tip up to cavoatrial junction.

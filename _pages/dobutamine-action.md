title: "Dobutamine action"
---
1) adrenergic agonist
2) strong beta1, weak beta2/alpha effects
3) positive inotropic agent -- increases force of contraction of heart muscle
4) increases CO/BP/HR
5) increases myocardial oxygen demand
6) decreases PVR (minimally)
7) IV administration - given in ICU setting
-mcg/kg/min
-careful monitoring of IV site
-central line best
8) used: 
-for short term treatment of HF - if increasing the force of muscle contraction, HR, BP, its going to increase the workload of the heart and make it tired
-cardiac test labs so if they cannot walk or exercise to get the heart popping then they will use this to artificially do it

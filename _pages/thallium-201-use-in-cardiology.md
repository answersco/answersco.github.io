title: "Thallium-201 use in cardiology"
---
Thallium-201 &#8594; produced in cyclotron
Half-life of 73 hours
Necessary to administer fairly low doses due to its long half-life&#8594; resultant lower count densities
Decays by electron capture
Emits characteristic x-rays of 69-81 keV
Relatively low energy characteristic x-rays &#8594; &#8593; attenuation artifact from chest wall soft tissues
Physiologically acts as a potassium analog&#8594; enters cells via active transport through the Na/K ATPase transmembrane pump.
Myocardial uptake&#8594; directly proportional to myocardial perfusion
50% stenosis&#8594; generally will produce a perfusion defect upon maximal exercise.
Undergoes redistribution with simultaneous cellular washout and re-extraction of blood-pool radiotracer
Since ischemic myocardium progressively extracts thallium but washes out more slowly than normal myocardium &#8594; post-redistribution images will thus show normalization of defects in ischemic but viable myocardium.
Scar will show a persistent defect.

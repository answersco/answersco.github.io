title: "IMPORTANT: How to think of modulation transfer function (MTF) in terms of spatial frequencies?"
---
MTF is a ratio of the output to input modulation 
- It gets worse (lower ratio) with focal spot, motion, and receptor size

* At low spatial frequency, MTF is close to 1.0 (due to great visibility of relatively large features)

* At high spatial frequency (for small features) the MTF falls towards ZERO (poorer visibility of small features)
- this also happens to mean LESS DQE (and requires a higher dose)

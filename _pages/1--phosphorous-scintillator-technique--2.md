title: "1. Phosphorous scintillator technique  2. Difference is that electrons remain in a higher energy state storing a latent image on the casette   3. The casette containing the latent image is then digitalized via a readout device   4. Readout machine uses a RED laser beam to stimulate the electrons to drop back down to their normal energy state   5. The falling electrons release blue light (called a photostimulated luminescence (PSL)  6. Amount of light is proportional to the amount of radiation exposure  7. Emitted light is captured with the Photomultiplier tube  8. The PMT output -&gt; ADC (analog to digital converter)  9. Then it goes to the computer can post-processing can be done   The Casette is exposed to intense light to erase the image so it can be used again"

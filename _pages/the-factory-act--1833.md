title: "The Factory Act (1833)"
---
the first major British law designed to improve factory conditions (some safety requirements) and reduce child labor (by limiting the factory workday for children between ages 9-13 to 8 hours/ 6 days a week, and that of adolescents between 14-18 to 12 hours); it broke the pattern of whole families working together in the factory and did not apply to agricultural labor at all

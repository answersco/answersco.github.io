Single-day Tc-99m sestamibi perfusion study&#8594; most commonly performed exam
Rest images&#8594; first obtained after 8-10 mCi of Tc-99m sestamibi
Stress images&#8594; obtained after an additional 20-30 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi during peak exercise or after administration of pharmacologic stress
Imaging performed ~ 30 minutes after injection to allow liver to clear
No redistribution&#8594; imaging can be delayed after tracer administration.
Gated SPECT images&#8594; show wall motion at time of imaging
Perfusion images&#8594; show perfusion at time of injection
PET perfusion
PET rest-stress myocardial perfusion &#8594; greater sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for diagnosis of coronary artery disease compared to SPECT.
Attenuation correction CT improves diagnostic accuracy 
Rubidium-82 and N-13 ammonia = perfusion agents&#8594; imaged on PET systems using coincidence detection.
Shorter half-lives&#8594; higher activities can be administered with lower overall radiation exposure.
For quantification of myocardial blood flow, N-13 ammonia is preferred as rubidium has a lower extraction fraction.
Exercise thallium
Because thallium undergoes redistribution, imaging is performed immediately post-exercise and approximately 3-4 hours later once redistribution has occurred.
Uncommonly used because of the long 73-hour thallium half life and resultant high patient dose.

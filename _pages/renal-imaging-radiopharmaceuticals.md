Tc-99m MAG3 is essentially entirely cleared by the renal tubules and therefore can assess renal tubular function. 
It also approximates effective renal plasma flow. 
Filtered and excreted by the renal tubules (&gt;50% extracted by glomerulus into tubules with each pass), with minimal filtration
Higher extraction fraction than DTPA&#8594; provides better images in patients with renal insufficiency or obstruction.
Tc-99m DTPA &#8594; cleared entirely by glomerular filtration, with no tubular secretion.
Closely approximates glomerular function (GFR)
Can also evaluate renal perfusion
Tc-99m DMSA &#8594; binds to the renal tubules, it does not assess their function.
Used in children to evaluate for the presence of renal scarring associated with pyelonephritis.
Collecting system isn't imaged.
DMSA is a specialized cortical agent &#8594; bound in renal tubules, allowing anatomic imaging of the cortex.
Only tracer for which SPECT is performed.

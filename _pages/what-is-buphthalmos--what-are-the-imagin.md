Literally Ox-eye, meaning an enlarged globe. Indicates increased intraoccular pressure as in glaucoma or in other syndromes like NF1 or Sturge Webber. CT or MRI will show enlargement of the involved globe and the sclera may appear thin and the anterior chamber may be enlarged. Enhancement of the retina may also be seen.

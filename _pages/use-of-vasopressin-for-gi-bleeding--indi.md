Indications: colonic and small bowel bleeding not amenable to embo. Useful when the general vicinity of bleeding is known, but selective catheterization isn't possible. 

Contraindications: active myocardial, limb, or bowel ischemia, uncooperative patient.
-Shouldn't be used for bleeding due to pseudoaneurysm or AVM.

Catheter location: proximal SMA or IMA so that the entire vascular bed is treated.

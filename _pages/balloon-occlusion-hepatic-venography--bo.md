title: "Balloon occlusion hepatic venography (BOHV)"
---
BOHV: can be used to image the small HVs as well as the portal vein.
-8-11 mm occlusion balloon gently inflated with dilute contrast until the HV is circumferentially engaged.
-Standard iodinated contrast or CO2 can then be injected by hand.
-Normal liver: portal vein usually not visualized because contrast drains into other HV branches.
-Cirrhosis: may see opacification of the portal vein and even retrograde flow.
-CO2 offers superior opacification of the PV due to its extremely low viscosity.
-Aggressive injection can result in hepatic fracture.

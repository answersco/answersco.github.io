Axillary arteriy: begins at lateral margin of first rib, extending to the lateral margin of the teres major muscle tendon.

All axillary and subclavian artery branches (except vertebrals) have potential anastomoses with each other.

The radial, ulnar, and median nerves lie in close proximity to the axillary artery, contained in a a connective tissue sheath with the artery.
-These are at risk for compression by even a small amount of bleeding within the sheath after axillary punctures.

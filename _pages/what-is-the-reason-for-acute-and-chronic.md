title: "What is the reason for acute and chronic myocardial abnormalities both having delayed hyperenhancement (DHE)?"

In acute infarcts, delayed washout is due to an increase in the volume of distribution of the interstitium due to destruction of myocytes and resultant edema.

In chronic infarcts, delayed washout is a result of scar tissue retaining contrast media.

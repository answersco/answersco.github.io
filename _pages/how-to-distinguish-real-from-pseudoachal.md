title: "How to distinguish real from pseudoachalasia?"
---
Pseudoachalasia is 2/2 cancer at GE junction, so the junction will never relax (it will relax in true achalasia, eventually)
- it's never as dilated as true achalasia
- narrowing is ECCENTRIC; mucosa is IRREGULAR at the site of narrowing

- Secondary achalasia = cancer, Chaga's, vagotomy

title: "What will increase your SNR in spin echo?   Increased # excitations, increased Receiver bandwidth, increased transmit bandwidth, or increased matrix size?"
---
Increased # excitations

SNR ~ voxel size * Root #excitations / Root Receiver bandwidth

(as you increase your receiver bandwidth, you sample MORE NOISE so less SNR!)

(as you increase your matrix, you decrease your voxel size, so less SNR)

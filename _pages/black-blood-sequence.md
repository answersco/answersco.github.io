title: "Black blood sequence"

This is going to be closer to a spine cho sequence
In reality this is something called &quot;double inversion recovery&quot;
Basically you are using 2 180 degree inversion pulses which effectively NULL the myocardium 
ALSO it is important to note that the BLOOD will be dark (think about the fact that SPIN ECHO blood is black)

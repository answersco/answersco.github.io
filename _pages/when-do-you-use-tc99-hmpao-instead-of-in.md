title: "When do you use Tc99 HMPAO instead of In-111 WBC for infection imaging?"
---
1. Kids = Tc99 will have lower absorbed dose &amp; shorter imaging time

2. Small parts = Tc99 is better in hands and feet

Disadvantage of Tc99 = shorter half life (6 hours) limits delayed imaging &amp; regular uptake in GI and Gallbladder limits those areas

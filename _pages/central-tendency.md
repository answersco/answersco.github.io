Central tendency (mean, median, or mode)
Mean = average
Median: defined as 50th percentile of the observed set of values. It represents the midpoint of a given range of values. Compared with the mean, the median is less influenced by unusual data points (i.e. outliers).
Mode: defined as the observed value that occurs most frequently in a data set. Most often used when variables of interest are categorical/nominal (e.g. race, sex).

Anterosuperior labrum: SLF and Buford complex

High signal between labrum and glenoid rim (SLF), or absent labrum (Buford complex)
Between origins of middle glenohumeral ligament (MGHL) and anterior band inferior glenohumeral ligament (IGHL)
Does not extend to involve superior labrum or anteroinferior labrum

SLF: Unattached but otherwise intact labrum
Extends posterior to biceps anchor in 55%

Buford complex: Thick diameter of MGHL

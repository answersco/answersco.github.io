title: "Intradecidual sac sign"
---
A small fluid collection surrounded by an echogenic ring separate from the endometrial cavity represented by an echogenic line. The gestational sac is in a subendometrial location, within the prominent decidua. This is the earliest manifestation of an intrauterine pregnancy, that can be seen on transvaginal US at 3.5 to 4 weeks. A pseudogestational sac sign is a fluid collection within the endometrial collection surrounded by a single echogenic ring without the endometrial stripe because the fluid is actually within the endometrial cavity.

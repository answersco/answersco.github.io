title: "Key differences between intra and extralobar sequestration?"
---
Both are aberrant lung formations WITHOUT connection to the bronchial tree or pulmonary arteries and WITH systemic arterial supply. LLL usually (unlike congenital lobar emphysema in the LUL)
* Neither should be filled with air unless INFECTED

1. INtralobar = in adolescents, recurrent INfections, NO PLEURAL COVER

2. Extralobar = in kids with assoc congenital heart dz, Venous drainage is via SYSTEMIC veins into the right atrium; since it's &quot;extra&quot; it has its own &quot;extra&quot; pleural cover

---
Acute ground-glass opacification (GGO)
Pulmonary edema (usually dependent)
PNA (more commonly atypical PNA such as viral or PCP)
Pulmonary hemorrhage
ARDS

Chronic GGO:
Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (tends to be focal or multifocal)
Organizing PNA (typically presenting as rounded, peripheral chronic consolidation)
Chronic eosinophilic PNA (usually upper lobe predominance)
Idiopathic pneumonias
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HSP): especially in the subacute phase, where there is GGO, centrilobular nodules, and mosaic attenuation
Alveolar proteinosis: distribution typically central, sparing the periphery.

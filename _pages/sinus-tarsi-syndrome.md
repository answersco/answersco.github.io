title: "Sinus tarsi syndrome"
---
This is where you have inflammation and scar form within the sinus tarsi
Associations with rheumatologic conditions as well as abnormal loading (flat foot)

Sinus tarsi fat obliterated

Sinus tarsi (between lateral talus and calcaneus) syndrome

Associations with rheumatologic disorders and abnormal loading (flat-foot in setting of PTT tear)
Caused by hemorrhage or inflammation of synovial recess with or without tears of the associated ligaments (talocalcaneal ligament, inferior extensor retinaculum)
MRI: obliteration of tat in the sinus tarsi space, and replacement with scar tissue

Torn ligaments of sinus tarsi. Results in subtalar instability. Granulation tissue (high T2, low T1) or scar (low T2, low T1) replaces normal fat (high T1) of sinus tarsi.

Interventional Reference Point (IRP): 
Describes the use of an ionization chamber with a set reference point (15 cm closer to the source than the isocenter of the IR system) to measure radiation emitted from the source
Skin dose can be above or below this point
Ignores geometry, table attenuation, and back-scatter&#8594; probably underestimates the patient's skin dose
The dose (outside lead) standing 1 meter from the patient is ~ 1/1000 the dose received by the patient

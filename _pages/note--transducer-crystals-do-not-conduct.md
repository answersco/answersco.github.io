title: "NOte: Transducer crystals do not conduct electricity. Instead, each site is coated with a thin layer of silver that acts as an electrode. The electrical energy causes the crystal to momentarily change shape (expand and contract). So the nonconducting crystal changes shape in response to a voltage placed on it's electrodes. The chance in shape increases and decreases the pressure in front of the transducer, thus producing ultrasound waves. BOOM AWESOME! Finally when the pressure changes by the returning ultrasound echoes, the pressure changes are converted back into electrical signals"

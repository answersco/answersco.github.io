title: "B. Subendocardial infarct. This image shows delayed hyperenhancement of the inferoseptal, inferolateral wall, and lateral LV wall. The DHE involves the subendocardium (arrow) which is suggestive of infarction, as opposed to the mid myocardial or epicardial location in myocarditis. The DHE does not involve the entire wall however, so it is a subendocardial as opposed to transmural infarct. A ventricular aneurysm would show a focal bulge of ventricular wall."

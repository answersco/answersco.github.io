Less than 1% of all breast cancer. Men greater than 60. Palpable mass.

Male breast cacner = average age 70; BRCA 2 in 25%; Klinefelter's, Cirrhosis, and alcoholism
- usually always IDC - NOS type (looks like cancer on mammo and ultrasound) = birads 5
- eccentric to nipple, unilateral, abnormal LNs, calcs in 25% (though microcalcs alone are uncommon in men)

- Only Klinefelter's patients approach teh screening range iwth regards to risk
* men with gynecomastia from gender reassignment on hormone therapy are NOT high risk enough for screening (men who became woman)

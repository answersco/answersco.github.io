title: "Proportional Mortality Ratio"
---
-reflects the proportion of deaths d/t a specific cause
-is not a rate
-does not estimate risk of death
-the number of deaths from a specific illness within a time period divided by the total number of deaths in the same time period from all other causes

EX. 
-There were 2,403,351 total deaths in the U.S. from all causes. Out of the 2,403,351 total deaths, 710,760 were from lung cancer.
-What is the proportional mortality ratio for lung cancer?

710,760 (# of deaths from lung cancer) =0.296 or 29.6 per 100
2,403,351 (total # of deaths in same time period from all causes)

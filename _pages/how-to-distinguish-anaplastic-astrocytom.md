title: "How to distinguish anaplastic astrocytoma from low-grade astrocytoma?"

Hard to tell! Requires biopsy

Low grade = Infiltrative, T2 bright cortically-based mass without necrosis and enhancement 

Anaplastic = Also presents as a T2 hyperintense infiltrative mass that may involve and expand the cortex and usually does not show any enhancement. Focal nodular or patchy enhancement is less commonly observed

title: "Dose calibrator accuracy testing:"
---
Accuracy testing&#8594; testing required after installation and repair, and on an annual basis thereafter using Dose Calibrator Accuracy
Uses one or more NIST-traceable radioisotope calibration standards.
Cs-137 source (662 keV; T1/2 ~30 years) or other long-lived source is typically used for accuracy testing.
Ideally the dose calibrator would also be tested at low and high energies
&#8594; Co-57 (122 keV, T1/2 ~282 days) and Co-60 (1.33 MeV; T1/2 ~5.3 years) are useful for this purpose.

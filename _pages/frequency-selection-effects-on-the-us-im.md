A transducer has a broad frequency bandwidth corresponding to a short emitted pulse. For example, a 3.5 MHz array transducer may emit a short ultrasound pulse that covers a frequency range from 2.0 MHz to 5.0 MHz. The nominal frequency of a transducer is usually the center frequency of the bandwidth. As the frequency increases, spatial resolution improves but penetration decreases.

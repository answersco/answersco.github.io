title: "IMPORTANT: With all things equal, if you Decrease the patient to I.I. distance in fluoro, what happens to your image contrast?"

It also DECREASES!

- When the patient is closer to the I.I., the scattered radiation will have less opportunity to diverge out of the field of view so more scatter = less contrast

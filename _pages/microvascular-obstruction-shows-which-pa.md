E. Regional subendocardial nonenhancement surrounded by a ring of DHE. Microvascular obstruction is present in the most severe acute infarctions. Gadolinium is unable to penetrate the myocytes due to necrotic blood vessels, so there is subendocardial nonenhancement. The ring of DHE represents infarcted myocardium without destruction of blood vessels, thus allowing gadolinium to reach this abnormal tissue. Isolated subendocardial enhancement is typically seen with smaller infarcts, while transmural DHE may be present in more severe infarcts. Myocarditis and other infiltrative processes demonstrate DHE in the mid myocardial wall or epicardium.

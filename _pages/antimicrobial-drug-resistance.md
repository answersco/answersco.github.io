title: "Antimicrobial drug resistance"
---
-the ability of microorganisms to resist the effects of certain drugs 
-drug can no longer be used for treatment
-microorganisms develop particular mechanisms over time
-new drug --&gt; no or very little resistance
-as drug is used --&gt; more and more microbes become resistant
EX. 
-penicillin worked great against all gram (+) infections like staphylococcus and they thought they would wipe out all infectious diseases
-penicillin began not working against patient with staphylococcus and eventually became resistant
-now, it is pretty much useless against staphylococcus and other gram (+) bacteria

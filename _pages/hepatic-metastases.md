Most are hypovascular&#8594; best appreciated on PV phase (versus HCC, which is hypervascular and best seen on late arterial phase images)

MRI: metastases tend to be T1-hypointense and T2-hyperintense
Blood products and melanin are T1-hyperintense

Pseudocirrhosis: macronodular liver contour resulting from multiple scirrhous hepatic metastases, most commonly due to treated breast cancer
Capsular retraction, if seen, is characteristic of pseudocirrhosis

title: "Factors affecting SUV values"
---
Weight: fat has low FDG uptake, so SUV values in fat people are overestimated (more sugar around for tumor)
-More accurate to use lean body mass than weight
-Super fat people can have falsely low SUV due to truncation artifact from tissue outside FOV (no data for AC).

Timing: longer uptake time = more FDG uptake
Longer time to scan = increased SUV values

Glucose: high glucose = lower SUV

Size: smaller than 1 cm = lower SUV

Dose extravasation = lower SUV

Reconstruction: more iterations = higher SUV

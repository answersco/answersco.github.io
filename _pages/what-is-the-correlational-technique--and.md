title: "What is the correlational technique, and what does it tell researchers about relationships?"
---
-Correlation is a statistical technique that allows researchers to discover and predict relationships between variables of interest.

-Positive correlations exist when increases in one variable are matched by increases in the other variable, whereas negative correlations exist when increases in one variable are matched by decreases in the other variable.

-Correlations cannot be used to prove cause-and-effect relationships.

Pulmonary sling: anomalous origin of left pulmonary artery from right pulmonary artery
Only vascular cause of stridor in a patient with a left-sided arch. Branching pattern is normal.
The anomalous left PA courses between the trachea and esophagus&#8594; usually only trachea trapped in sling, uncommonly also bronchus intermedius.
Associated with tracheal anomalies, including tracheomalacia and bronchus suis (RUL bronchus originating from trachea).
Lateral: posterior indentation of trachea, and anterior indentation of esophagus (also only one to cause anterior impression)

Lymphoma: most common splenic malignancy
Primary splenic lymphoma (rare): usually presents as a solitary hypovascular mass. 
In contrast to hamartoma or metastatic disease, primary splenic lymphoma may extend beyond the splenic capsule and involve adjacent organs.
Secondary splenic lymphoma (systemic): much more common, with 4 different imaging presentations
Miliary masses
Multiple small to moderate-sized masses
One large mass
Splenomegaly without discrete mass
Conspicuity is highest on post-contrast T1W images&#8594; involved portion of the spleen tends to be hypoenhancing
US: may appear cystic, but with internal flow on color Doppler

title: "ECMO"
---
Veno-venous
Veno-arterial

In both cases, the blood is pumped from the RIGHT ATRIUM
In VV, you then pump the blood BACK into the right atrium (this gives you lung support but does not rest the LV)
In AV, the arterial portion of the catheter attaches to the origin of the INNOMINATE (this gives you lung and LV support)
Potential complications:
VA: They ligate the right carotid when placing the arterial line, so neurologic complications are possible 
All these kids are at HIGH risk for hemorrhage (brain), bc they are already super sick and you have to fully anticoagulate when on ECMO
All these kids get screening for germinal matrix hemorrhage AND typically get followed by ultrasound ]

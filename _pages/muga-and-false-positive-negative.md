title: "MUGA and false positive/negative"
---
MUGA: equilibrium radionuclide angiogram with cardiac pool images taken after tracer has equilibrated to intravascular space
Requires gating
Tc-99m-labeled RBCs used for purpose of calculating EF

Pericardial effusion: photopenic halo around cardiac blood pool
Regional wall motion abnormality on resting MUGA: usually infarct (could also be stunned or hibernating).

False low EF: screwed up LAO view can cause overlap of LV with LA or RV or even great vessels, with falsely low EF.
Falsely high EF: wrong background ROI (over spleen)- causes subtraction of background, elevating EF.

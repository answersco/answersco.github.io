title: "Turbidity"
---
-also an indirect method - aka not seeing individual cells and counting them
-as bacteria growth in a liquid growth media, they turn the media cloudy due to the number of cells in the test tube
-increases turbidity = increases number of cells
-light is absorbed meaning the higher the number measured from light, the higher number of cells are present

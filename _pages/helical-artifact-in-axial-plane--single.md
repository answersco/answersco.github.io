Helical Artifact in Axial Plane: Single Section
Seen most frequently around the top of the skull&#8594; from anatomy changing rapidly in the Z-direction
The higher the pitch, the worse the effect
Minimizing helical artifact: Reduce variation in the z-direction
Use lower pitch
Use 180 degree instead of 360 when possible
Use thin sections instead of thick
This is why head CT is commonly done with axial scanning instead of helical

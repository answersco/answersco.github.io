title: "What is lead time bias?"
---
Lead time bias is the overestimation of survival duration among screening detected cases when survival is measured from the DATE OF DIAGNOSIS
- ex) Syndrome X detected at age 20 and they die at age 35 (survival 15 years); but new test detects it at birth, so survival falsely elevated to 35 years

* An appropriate way to avoid lead-time bias is to compare age-specific mortality rates, rather than survival rates from the time of diagnosis.

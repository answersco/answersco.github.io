title: "Sestamibi parathyroid scan"
---
Sestamibi is a cationic complex found to localize in thyroid and parathyroid tissue. The kinetics of the compound are different for both tissues. After the initial uptake, there is no significant wash-out of sestamibi from parathyroid adenoma tissue which is presumably due to mitochondrial binding. In contrast, by 2 hours, there is marked reduction in sestamibi concentration within the thyroid tissue thus resulting in high parathyroid-to-thyroid uptake ratio of the radiopharmaceutical.

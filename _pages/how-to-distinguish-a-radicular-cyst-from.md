title: "How to distinguish a radicular cyst from a DENTIGEROUS cyst?"
---
Dentigerous = &quot;from the crown of an unerupted tooth&quot;
- this is Developmental (rather than acquired like Radicular)

* DENTIGEROUS = DISPLACES&quot; and RESORPS adjacent teeth in the apical direction 
- can displace into the condylar regions of the mandible or orbital floor

title: "Main advantage and disadvantage of superconductor magnet design?"
---
Main advantage of superconductive design &#8594; significant savings in the cost of electricity needed to run the machine (compared to resistive magnet).
After energizing with DC current, the coils are shunted with a superconductive relay switch, thus completing the current loop with zero electrical resistance
&#8594; The electrical power supply can then be disconnected and the current in the coils will flow steadily for practically forever
&#8594; thus, obviates the need for external source of electrical current&#8594; electricity cost savings.

Main disadvantage&#8594; substantial costs of maintaining the magnet's cryosystem (liquid He)
Also, when the magnet is fully operational, a large amount of energy is stored in the magnetic field produced by the coil&#8594; release of the energy (e.g. during a quench) &#8594; could cause significant damage.

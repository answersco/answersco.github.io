Advantages: 
Improved lateral spatial resolution
Reduced side-lobe artifact
Removal of multiple reverberation artifact (from adjacent anatomy)
Cysts look clearer

Disadvantages: 
2nd harmonic is at a higher frequency than fundamental frequency&#8594; attenuates far more rapidly &#8594; reduced depth of penetration
The required processing generally requires 2 transmitted pulses for each line of sight in the image &#8594; reduces frame-rate by a factor of 2
Hypoechoic masses look like cysts

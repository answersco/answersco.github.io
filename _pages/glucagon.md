title: "Glucagon"
---
-released from alpha cells
-causes immediate mobilization of glycogen
-raises blood glucose levels

leads to increased cyclicAMP production making signals cross the membrane resulting in increased contractility

-located: liver
-function: increases blood glucose levels by stimulating liver to breakdown glycogen into glucose

-produced by alpha cells of the Islets
-released when glucose levels are low in blood
-encourages the breakdown of glycogen, and the release of glucose into blood

Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) &#8594; &#8595; pulmonary vascularity without cardiomegaly
Most common cause of cyanotic heart disease in children and adults.
4 components:
RV outflow tract obstruction
RV hypertrophy
VSD
Aorta overriding the VSD
Degree of cyanosis depends on degree of RV outflow obstruction.
Classic findings are boot-shaped heart (cardiac apex uplifted by RV hypertrophy, despite normal heart size) and &#8595; pulmonary vascularity
25% with right-sided aortic arch.

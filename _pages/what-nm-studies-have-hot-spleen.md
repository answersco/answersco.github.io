title: "What NM studies have hot spleen?"
---
Octreotide and WBC

Octreotide is a high-count study, so images look cleaner.
Octreotide = no bones + liver + spleen + kidneys

Tc-WBC: imaged at 4 hours at 24 hours
-4 hours: can see lung uptake
-24 hours: lungs clearing up, and starting to see bowel uptake.
-Spleen &gt; liver
-Higher count study than In-WBC (which doesn't have renal or GI uptake), so will look clear.

Sulfur colloid will have tracer in spleen, but not as much as in liver.

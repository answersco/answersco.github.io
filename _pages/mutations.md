title: "Mutations"
---
-change in one base
-when in sperm or egg cells, these are passed on to the next generation
-also may be positive (switch things and can become resistant to things such as sickle cell anemia [only heterozygous] is positive bc they cannot get malaria), negative (switch something so then it doesn't work correctly), or neutral (no difference)

-rapid reproduction of bacteria can produce beneficial mutations 
-selection of these mutants
-acquiring the trait (gene) from another microbe already resistant to the drug (intermicrobial gene transfer)

random changes in the structure or number of DNA molecules in a cell that can be inherited by offspring

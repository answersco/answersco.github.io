title: "Indium-111 oxine leukocytes"
---
Normal distribution: spleen &gt; liver &gt;&gt; bone marrow
Infection imaging is performed at 24 hours
Key advantage of indium-111 oxine WBCs compared to gallium:
Lack of physiologic bowel accumulation&#8594; allows evaluation of abdominal or bowel infection/inflammation.
Disadvantages compared to gallium:
Tedious labeling procedure
Higher radiation dose
Less accuracy in diagnosing spinal osteomyelitis
Advantages of indium-111 WBC scan compared to Tc-99m HMPAO:
Absence of interfering bowel and renal activity
Ability to perform delayed imaging
Ability to perform simultaneous Tc-99m sulfur colloid or Tc-99m MDP bone scan &#8594; very helpful for evaluation of osteomyelitis in the setting of an abnormal baseline bone scan (e.g. prosthesis evaluation).

title: "Tc MDP + Gallium Scan for Infection"
---
+ For infection = MORE gallium uptake than MDP uptake (you will still probs see some MDP uptake)

- For infection = MORE MDP uptake than gallium uptake (this is consistent with DDD)

Equivocal for infection = SAME amount of gallium and MDP uptake.

The image shows a scan that is consistent with DDD. There is MORE MDP uptake (lower images) than Gallium uptake (upper images)

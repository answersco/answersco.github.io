title: "When testing a hypothesis, what is statistical power?"

Probability of correctly rejecting a null hypothesis when it is false
The power of a study is related to the probability that a Type II error is avoided. Type II error occurs when the study results fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is false. 
The null hypothesis refers to a general statement or default position that there is no relationship between two measured phenomena

If a study does not include enough subjects to adequately test the hypothesis, then the study exposes subjects to risk when there is no potential for scientific gain. Sample size depends on the standard deviation and the smallest meaningful difference between the 2 means being compared. A study can use a smaller sample size if the standard deviation is reduced (by using a more precise measurement or a more homogeneous population) or increasing the effect size.

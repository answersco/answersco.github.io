-during infancy and childhood, the epiphyses fill with spongy bone
-cartilage in adults is limited to articular cartilage covering joint surfaces and epiphyseal plate
-by late teens to early 20's, all remaining cartilage in the epiphyseal plate is generally consumed
-any gap b/w diaphysis and epiphyses has closed and the line forms
-primary and secondary cavities fuse into one
-no more lengthening

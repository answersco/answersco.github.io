title: "LE US: response to Valsalva; augmentation"
---
Normal response to Valsalva: cessation of flow
-Blunted response indicates proximal obstruction
-Retrograde flow: indicates valvular insufficiency

Augmentation: 
Patency of nonvisualized segments can be assessed indirectly by measuring Doppler signal central to the area of interest while gently squeezing the calf.
-Sudden increase in velocity or flow is expected normal response.

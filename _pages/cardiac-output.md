title: "Cardiac output"
---
depends on stroke volume (preload, afterload, contractility) and the heart rate which is dependent on SNS activity, PNS activity, and epinephrine

HR x SV
-the amount of blood pumped out of your heart every minute

amount of blood pumped out of aorta and pumped against arterial walls (How much blood is really pumped out with each pump) - if a lot then BP will rise

-amount ejected by each ventricle in one minute
-heart rate x stroke volume

title: "Access and device selection in chronic mesenteric ischemia"

Femoral access with a curved guide catheter works well for selecting the artery and positioning devices in most cases. 
When the artery has a very steep downward angle from the aorta, brachial artery access (usually left) facilitates selection and manipulation. 

Stiff working guide wore is essential because decides must make an almost 180-degree turn in some cases. 

Full heparinization is critical. 

Balloon-expandable stents are used for ostial lesions (including for IMA if it is dominant supply to colon). 
Self-expanding stents can be useful for lesions deeper in the SMA.

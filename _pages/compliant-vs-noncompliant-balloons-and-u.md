title: "Compliant vs noncompliant balloons and usage"
---
Compliant balloons: conform to the vessel walls rather than dilate
-Commonly used to temporarily occlude flow or sweep away thrombus during balloon thrombectomy

Noncompliant balloons: reach a nominal predetermined diameter during inflation and remain close to that diameter as pressure is increased to the bursting point.
-Waist visualized in balloon at site of maximal stenosis
-Desirable for angioplasty- otherwise the balloon expands on either side of the waist without dilated the stenosis
-Very high-pressure noncompliant balloons (up to 30 atm) used in venous and nonvascular applications, with lower pressure balloons used in arterial lesions.

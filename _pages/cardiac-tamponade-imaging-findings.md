title: "Cardiac Tamponade imaging findings?"
---
- short axis imaging during deep inspiration --&gt; Flattening or inversion of IV septum towards the LV (2/2 augmented RV filling)
- CT reflux into the IVC &amp; azygos
* These are also seen in constrictive pericarditis!

* Tamponade = Look for BOWING of ventricles in DIASTOLE

* Chambers will cave in during diastole (due to pericardial pressures being &gt; any chambers' pressure)

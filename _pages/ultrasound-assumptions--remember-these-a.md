title: "Ultrasound Assumptions (remember these are not true but just what the probe assumes)"
---
All echoes originate from the main beam
All echoes return to the transducer after a 180 degree reflection
Amount of time it takes for the beam to return is completely dependent on the depth of the object
Speed of sound in human tissue is uniform (1540 m/d)
Sound beam and echo travel in a straight path
Acoustic energy is uniformly attenuated

title: "Drug monitoring"
---
-includes looking at the peak, trough, onset, and duration

EX. Vancomycin: draw a trough level on this just before the third dose bc if it is not being reabsorbed accurately in the body then administering the next dose with high levels then it could lead to more medication than needed
-worried about excretion and toxicity from too much
-if you do not have enough of the drug to make a response, then they would know they need to increase the dosage in order to fight the infection

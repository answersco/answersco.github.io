title: "Preventing the spread of drug resistance"
---
1) creating new antibiotics - stay ahead of the game
2) use antimicrobial drugs only when indicated or needed
3) reserve potent and newest antimicrobials for serious infections
4) use proper dose and treat for appropriate length of time -- making sure the patient takes the entire dose of medication and not stopping when you feel better, in order to get any straggler bacteria
5) limit use of antibiotics as growth additive for food animal production -- if you feed an animal antibiotics, it makes them grow faster but it turns out the more you expose the animals to antimicrobials, the more resistance develops
-this affects humans because we get into contact with the animals and their products like raw meat
-might not do anything to you but it can pass on their antimicrobial resistance bacteria into your system

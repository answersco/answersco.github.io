title: "Effect of gradient and slice thickness on resolution"
---
Gradient with higher amplitude (more intense) or applied for a longer period of time results in better spatial resolution

Thinner slices (decrease transmit RF pulse/slice-selection pulse or increase SSG) leads to better spatial resolution

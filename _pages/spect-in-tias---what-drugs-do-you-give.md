title: "SPECT in TIAs - what drugs do you give - what is the idea behind imaging"
---
- evaluate cerebrovascular reserve by giving acetazolamide (vasodilator), followed by perfusion tracer (HMPAO or ECD)

- TIA: in areas which have already maxed out their autoregulatory vasodilation (at risk for ischemia), they will be hypointense

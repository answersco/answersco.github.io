title: "How can ischemic cardiomyopathy be differentiated from dilated cardiomyopathy? A) The amount of ventricular dilation B) Pattern of delayed hyperenhancement C) Impaired wall thickening D) Changes in myocardial strain E) All of the above"

B. Pattern of delayed hyperenhancement. Chronic infarcts have DHE that involve the subendocardium. Dilated cardiomyopathy can have DHE, but it is usually in the mid myocardium or subepicardium. The others choices can be seen in either ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy.

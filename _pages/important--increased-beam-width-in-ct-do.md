title: "IMPORTANT: Increased beam width in CT does what to scan time, motion artifact, partial volume, and radiation dose?"
---
- Reduces scan time
- Reduces motion artifact
- INCREASES partial volume
- * NO EFFECT on radiation dose (mAs is unchanged, scan time less, but larger area of tissue scanned at the same time)

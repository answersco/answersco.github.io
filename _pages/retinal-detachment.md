Look for the V or Y sign
This is going to be the retina lifted up (the leaflets)

Note: with retinal detachment you are going to have CONVERGENCE towards the optic disc (no sparing) and it is going to be STOPPED anteriorly by the ora serrata (figure a and b on the image)

Choroidal detachment is going to SPARE The optic disc and go MORE anteriorly (figure c and d)

title: "Pseudocoarctation?"
---
Focal narrowing without hemodynamic significance. No collaterals.

Elongation with narrowing and kinking of the aorta
Looks like coarctation- but NO pressure gradient, collateral formation, or rib notching.

May develop aneurysmal dilation distal to areas of narrowing, which may become progressively dilated and should be followed.

-we all have self-care requisites such as breathing, companionship, eating/drinking

Three levels assistance:
1) Total Assistance- during more than half of what the pt needs for ADLs

2) Partial Assistance: touching pt or other stuff to help the pt, up to half of what they can do

3) Supportive or Educative: do not need to help pt physically but are still giving the education needed to continue care

title: "Callosal Dysgenesis"
---
Absent corpus callosum on sagittal, coronal
Atrium/occipital horns dilated (&quot;colpocephaly&quot;)
On CT, colpocephaly key to diagnosis
DTI: Callosal fiber tracts form Probst bundles instead of crossing, where CC is absent
Vertical/posterior course of ACA (no genu to sweep around)

defective development of the corpus callosum usually secondary to other congenital malformation, namely cyst or lipoma in the midline near the corpus.

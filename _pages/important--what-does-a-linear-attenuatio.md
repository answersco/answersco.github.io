title: "IMPORTANT: What does a linear attenuation coefficient of 0.15 cm^-1 mean?"
---
It means that after 1 cm, 15% of the incident photons will be attenuated (e.g. NOT transmitted through 1 cm of that material)

It's related to e^(-ut)

Therefore after 2 cm, intuitively you'd lose 15% in the first cm and another 15% (total 30%) in the 2nd cm. However, since it's NOT PERFECTLY LINEAR, you actually lose about 26%.

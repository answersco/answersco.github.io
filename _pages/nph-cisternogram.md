title: "NPH cisternogram"
---
The 24 and 48-hour delayed scintigraphic image in anterior and left lateral projections demonstrates activity within the lateral ventricles. There is also a paucity of activity along the outer convexity of the brain superiorly (near the vertex).

The normal radionuclide cisternogram demonstrates activity ascending to the basal cisterns by four hours. The radiopharmaceutical will extend into the interhemispheric and Sylvian fissures forming the so-called Neptune's triumvirate. Activity should be identified over the convexities of the brain by 24 hours. Normally, there is no reflux of activity into the lateral ventricles. However, a small amount of activity which is transiently present in the lateral ventricles within the first 24 hours is within the accepted limits of normal and generally disregarded. Persistent activity within the lateral ventricles after 24 hours is virtually diagnostic in the proper clinical setting.

title: "How are operational definitions, independent and dependent variables, experimental and control groups, and random assignment used in designing an experiment?"
---
-Experiments are tightly controlled manipulations of variables that allow researchers to determine cause-and-effect relationships.

-The independent variable in an experiment is the variable that is deliberately manipulated by the experimenter to see if related changes occur in the behavior or responses of the participants and is given to the experimental group.

-The dependent variable in an experiment is the measured behavior or responses of the participants.

-The control group receives either a placebo treatment or nothing.

-Random assignment of participants to experimental groups helps to control for individual differences both within and between the groups that might otherwise interfere with the experiment's outcome.

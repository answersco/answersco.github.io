leukoplakia

LEUKOPLAKIA = PRE MALIGNANT LESION (mural filling defect) before squamous cell (2/2 chronic irritations like stones or infections --&gt; Metaplasia)

Malakoplakia = Immunosuppressed women with chronic UTIs; plaque like or nodular intramural lesions; NOT PRE MALIGNNAT! 

&quot;Mal is actually NOT bad :-)&quot;

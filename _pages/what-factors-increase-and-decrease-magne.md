title: "What factors increase and decrease magnetic susceptibility artifact?"
---
Increasing receiver bandwidth: decreases magnetic susceptibility artifact by restricting geometric distortion to a smaller space.

Increasing field strength, increasing voxel size, and increasing slice thickness increase geometric distortion, and thus worsen susceptibility artifact.

title: "Most common congenital pancreatic anomaly:"
---
Pancreas divisum: failure of fusion of ventral and dorsal pancreatic ducts
Ventral duct (Wirsung) only drains a portion of the pancreas
The majority of the pancreatic exocrine gland output is drained through the smaller duct of Santorini into the minor papilla
May be a cause of pancreatitis due to obstruction at the minor papilla by a Santorinicele (focal dilation of the terminal duct)
Crossing sign: CBD crossing over the main duct to join the duct of Wirsung

title: "Thyroid cancer subtypes and response to I131"

Papillary = most common (papillary is popular) and does well with surgery + I-131

Medullary thyroid cancer (occurs in MEN 2a and 2b): does NOT take up I-131, and thus responds poorly.
10% with uptake on MIBG or Octreotide
Cold on thyroid scan

Things that can make you treatment resistant:
Medullary subtype
Prior I-131 (easy gland killed off)
Methimazole treatment (even if years ago)

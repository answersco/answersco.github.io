attempt case illustrating MPC's substantial step test; here conviction is reversed b/c his criminal intention was abandoned prior to committing the substantial step toward buying cocaine; mens rea not firmed up to coincide w/ act; just mere preparation to buy drugs; never took a substantial step; irrelevant why he refused to commit the substantial step

---
Benign aggressive neoplastm that may involve vertebral body and posterior elements.

In the hip, favors the greater trochanter (this is an epiphyseal equivalent)
These do NOT arise from locations that are not epiphyseal or equivalent lesions

Benign lesion located eccentrically in the epiphysis of a long bone in skeletally immature patient

Chondroblastoma (90% 5-25 yo) &#8594; classically shown 2 ways
Epiphysis of the tibia on a 15 year old
In an epiphyseal equivalent (patella, calcaneus, carpal bones, apophyses)
Features: thin sclerotic rim, extension across physeal plate (25-50%), periostitis (30%), +/- bone marrow and soft-tissue edema on MR
One of the only lesions that is often not T2 bright
Tend to recur after resection (30%)
Chondroblastoma in hip&#8594; tends to favor greater trochanter more than femoral epiphysis

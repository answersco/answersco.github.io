3D MRI Benefits
Allows for thinner slices (&lt;1mm)
Slices are contiguous.
&#8593; SNR compared to that with 2D acquisition.
3D voxels can be isotropic (e.g. 1mm x 1mm x 1mm) &#8594; Isotropic voxels&#8594; enable multiplanar reconstruction with good resolution in all planes.

3D MRI Problems
Many 3D techniques are GRE-based&#8594; thus susceptible to magnetic field inhomogeneity and magnetic susceptibilities.
Artifact-prone (e.g. ghosting, distortion, signal voids, motion).

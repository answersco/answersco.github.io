title: "Desquamative interstitial pneumonia"
---
hazy GG opacities in the lower lungs. small cystic spaces are common. May be confused with NSIP, RB-ILD (along the same spectrum) and hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

95% are cigarette smokers. Cannot be radiologically distinguished from UIP. Bibasilar reticular opacities. Normal or midly decreased lung volumes. May have ground-glass opacities. Honeycombing is rare.

This is thought of as END STAGE RB ILD
You are going to see more of a basilar predominance
This is going to have a lot of ground glass and has a lot of overlap with RB ILD therefore biopsy is needed if these entities are suspected

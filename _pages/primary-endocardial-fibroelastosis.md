title: "Primary endocardial fibroelastosis"
---
Endocardial fibroelastosis refers to a pronounced, diffuse thickening of the ventricular endocardium and presents as unexplained heart failure in infants and children. 
-Echocardiography may show echogenic endocardial surface and a spherical shape to the left ventricle, but this appearance has a weak correlation with endocardial fibroelastosis on histology. Perfusion MRI shows a hypointense layer at the endocardial surface that corresponds to an area of delayed enhancement.

The Congress of Vienna reorganized the 300 principalities of the Holy Roman Empire into 38 German states, ruled by Prussia and Austria. States retained independence and met at a Confederation Diet, although they had little political power. When students and liberal reformers fought for national unification, the Karlsbad Decrees were used to prevent them by controlling the liberal population.

title: "Importance of chemolithotrophy"
---
-vital step in many nutrient cycles
-nitrogen processing extremely important -- nitrogen fixation
-provides usable forms of nitrogen to higher organisms like plants
-cannot use ammonia from nitrogen fixation so chemoautotrophs take the ammonia and oxidize it which converts it to another form with nitrifying bacteria to covert to nitrate which plants can then use

Normal: bulk of flow should be antegrade (liver&#8594; heart)
Increased HV pulsatility: tricuspid regurgitation, right-sided CHF
TR: D wave (2nd curve below midline) is deep to S (first curve below midline)
R heart failure: S is deep to D
Decreased HV pulsatility: cirrhosis, hepatic venous outflow obstruction.

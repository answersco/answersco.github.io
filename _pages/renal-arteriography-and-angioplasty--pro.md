title: "Renal arteriography and angioplasty: projection of choice, and when to use angioplasty vs stent"
---
LAO: projection of choice for looking at the renal arteries.

Angioplasty: used for Tx of HTN secondary to atherosclerosis (usually ostial) or FMD (usually mid-vessel)
-CCBs can be used to decrease risk of spasm
-Heparin should be used, and most patients take ASA for 6 months.
-Indications: renal vascular HTN or azotemia (unilateral stenosis should NOT cause azotemia)

AS at ostium: angiopasty + stent
FMD (usually mid-vessel): angioplasty alone

FASI on T2WI in 70-90% of preteen children
Plexiform neurofibromas
Optic pathway gliomas
Parenchymal gliomas
Sphenoid wing and occipital bone dysplasia found in association with plexiform tumors
WM lesions may also involve cerebellar white matter, globus pallidus, thalamus, brainstem
WM lesions are hyperintense and typically poorly defined; no mass effect
Vascular dysplasias &#8594; stenosis, moyamoya, aneurysm

Bilateral plexiform neurofibromas are present at almost every visualized spinal level with extramedullary tumors that enlarge the neural foramina. Plexiform neurofibromas are pathognomonic of neurofibromatosis type 1.
In children, optic gliomas and white matter lesions dominate the clinical picture. The white matter lesions develop in early childhood, peak around age 8, and usually regress by the late teens.

Osseous findings include ANTERIOR TIBIAL BOWING and
Pseudoarthrosis at the distal fibula

Bilateral optic gliomas
Astrocytomas
Plexiform neurofibroma (pathognomonic)
GIST
Cafe au lait spots
Freckles
Large vessel aneurysm and stenosis (RAS)
Sphenoid wing dysplasia
Pseudoarthrosis in long bones
Breast cancer
Neuroblastoma

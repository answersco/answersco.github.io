title: "When to obtain SHG in a premenopausal woman with heavy periods (e.g. what endometrial thickness)?"
---
There is controversy about the optimum threshold level of endometrial thickness that should prompt further evaluation in premenopausal women. In the early proliferative phase thickness &gt; 16 mm may be considered abnormal. If the patient was in the secretory phase (days 14-28) of her cycle a follow-up scan in early proliferative phase would be the most appropriate exam.

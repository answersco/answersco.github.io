title: "Lipomatous hypertrophy of the intra-atrial septum"
---
Buzzword: DUMBELL shape fat density (because it spares the foramen ovalis)
IF foramen ovalis is not spared think LIPOMA

-This is associated with being old and fat (can cause a supraventricular arrythmia)
- Can be HOT on PET because it is often made of brown fat

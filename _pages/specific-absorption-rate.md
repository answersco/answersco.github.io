SAR
This is the measurement to make sure you are not frying the patient with the RF pulse 

Factors affecting SAR:

- Magnet strength: if you double the strength of the magnet then you QUADRUPLE the SAR 
- Flip angle - if you doubel the flip angle then you are going to QUADRUPLE the SAR (this means that a spin echo is going to have MORE SAR than a GRE that has a flip angle of less than 90)
- Duty cycle: think of this as tissue cool down and it is related to the TR. If you INCREASE the TR then you let the tissue cool down longer. This is NOT exponential.

SAR = B^2 x alpha ^2 x duty cycle
Measured in watts/kg
1 W/kg -&gt; temperature increase of 1 degree C/hr
Higher in SE (larger flip angles)
Increases with number of RF pulses
Increases with square of magnet strength
Increases with square of flip angle (alpha)
Increases with duty cycle (cool down)
Longer TR -&gt; decreased duty cycle
Highest in EPI (lots of gradient switches)

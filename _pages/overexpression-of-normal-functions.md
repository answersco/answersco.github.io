title: "Overexpression of normal functions"
---
1) viruses DNA integrated next to a proto-oncogene can cause rapid transcription when the virus is transcribed
-increased production of oncogene encoded protein switches on genes that promote mitosis, triggers changes
2) proto-oncogene may be activated when it is moved next to an actively transcribed gene
-gland synthesizes the hormone, oncogene is expressed 

EX.
-cervical and anal cancer following HPV infection
-Burkitt lymphoma (both from translocation or inversion places a proto-oncogene next to an antibody gene)

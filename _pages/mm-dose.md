Mammography Quality Standards Acts (MQSA) &#8594; limits glandular dose from mammography to 3 mGy (&lt;300 millirads) per image for an average breast using a grid
If no grid is used, the dose should be &lt; 1 mGy per image
Average breast: 4.2 cm compressed breast with 50/50 glandular/adipose tissue composition
National averages show 15% lower dose for digital mammography compared to that of analog digital (1.8 mGy for analog, 1.62 mGy for digital).

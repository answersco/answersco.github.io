title: "What are contraindications for BRTO?"
---
BRTO causes more blood flow to go to portal system, because you've destroyed the gastrorenal or gastrocaval shunt route. Thus, more blood flow to portal system = worsen ascites and esophageal varices

- Refractory ascites (will worsen)
- High-risk esophageal varies (worsen after BRTO)
- Portal vein occlusion

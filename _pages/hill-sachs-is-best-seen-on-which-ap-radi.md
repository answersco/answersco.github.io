title: "Hill-Sachs is best seen on which AP radiograph view?"
---
Internal rotation - the lesser tuberosity is brought medially and projects over inferior glenoid

- Will see the Hill-Sachs deformity on posterolateral humeral head

On external rotation, it's just a subtle rounded lucency at the superolateral humeral head with a sclerotic margin

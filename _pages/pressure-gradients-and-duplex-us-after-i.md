title: "Pressure gradients and Duplex US after intervention for chronic mesenteric ischemia."
---
Pressure gradients across visceral stenoses are often high, even after successful stent placement, and do not seem to reflect the clinical response. 

Restenosis by Duplex criteria occurs in 2/3, but only 1/2 of these (1/3 overall) develop recurrent symptoms over 3 years.

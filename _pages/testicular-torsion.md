title: "Testicular torsion"
---
-enlarged, hypo echoic testis
-absent flow
&lt;6 hours --&gt; de-torse
-causes: bell-clapper deformity = high attachment of tunica vaginalis --&gt; do orchiopexy on other side

Less than six hours - salvagable. Greater than 24 hours - poor prognosis. Hyper acute - no bloodflow, hyperechoic. Acute (a few hours to 24 hours) - enlarged and heterogeneous. Missed torsion -enlarged with increased flow and skin thickening.

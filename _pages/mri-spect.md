Notice: Choline, creatine, and NAA are in alphabetical order
- The normal upward slop line formed by these peaks is called hunters angle 
- NAA = marker of neuronal viability (will be super high in canavans disease)
- Choline = cell turnover (this is going to be HIGH in anything with high cell turnover (tumor,infarct, inflammation)
- Normal brain should NOT have lactate peak (lactate = aerobic metablism i.e. necrotic tumor and infection)

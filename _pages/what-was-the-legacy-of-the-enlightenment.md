title: "What was the legacy of the enlightenment?"
---
1) Rejected the older ideas of AUTHORITY as truth like Absolutism and the Divine Right of Kings -- the source of TRUTH was now observation and reason (scientific method) instead
2) Belief in progress -- optimistic outlook for future
3) Encouraged a secular, non-religious focus
4) Individualism and independence as reason takes center stage 
5) The old social hierarchy of nobility was irrational and should not be supported by gov't or law 6) These ideas laid the foundation for the American and French Revolution

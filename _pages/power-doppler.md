title: "Power Doppler"
---
Gives a very sensitive look for the presence of flow without information on direction.
-Still get color, but instead each pixel registers the total # of frequency shifts, and the amplitude.
-Does NOT exhibit aliasing (seen on both spectral and color Doppler)
-NO dependence on Doppler angle (can image totally perpendicular to vessel)
-Extremely sensitive to flow, even if very slow.

much more sensitive than color doppler
This has NO dependence on doppler angle, i.e., flow could be measured completely perpendicular to the direction of blood flow
This does NOT show information about flow direction

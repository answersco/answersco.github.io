title: "Diagnosis and treatment of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD):"
---
Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD): idiopathic vascular disease affecting primarily the renal and carotid arteries.
Predominantly young or middle-aged women, bilateral in &#8532; of cases.
Tends to affect the mid or distal third of the renal arteries (unlike atherosclerotic stenosis, which affects the ostia)
Most common form is the medial fibroplasia subtype (80%): features the classic string of pearls or string of beads appearance on angiography.
Intimal fibroplasia: less common form, typically in children&#8594; appears as a smooth stenosis.
Treatment: FMD responds well to angioplasty alone (unlike atherosclerotic RAS, which responds better to angioplasty + stenting)
Relatively frequent occurrence of restenosis following angioplasty (10-15%)
Stenting is not recommended&#8594; can complicate retreatment with angioplasty and lead to in-stent stenosis due to intimal hyperplasia.

title: "Difference between DTPA and MAG3 findings for renal artery stenosis in captopril study?"
---
DTPA is for GFR so it will have decreased uptake and flow due to loss of normal perfusion pressure

MAG3 is for ERPF and is secreted, so it'll have marked tracer retention without excretion

If the issue is bilateral, it's often NOT due to RAS

Has to do with refraction (change in direction of transmitted US energy at tissue boundary when beam is not perpendicular to the boundary).

Refraction is influenced by speed change (based on tissue compression) and the angle of incidence.

Sin angle1 / Sin angle2 = Speed 2 / Speed 1

No refraction occurs if the sound is the same in the 2 media or with perpendicular incidence.

Refraction is the cause of shadows seen at the edges of a fluid-filled structure (e.g. GB) as sound passes from tissue to fluid.

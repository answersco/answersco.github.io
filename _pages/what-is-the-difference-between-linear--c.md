title: "What is the difference between linear, curved, and phased-array transducers?"
---
Linear (includes curved)
Simultaneous firing of small group of adjacent elements &#8594; width of the transducer is equal to the width of the individual elements
Rectangular FOV

Curved array: trapezoidal FOV.
Scan lines diverge deeper into the image &#8594; wider FOV for deeper structures (e.g. abdominal or pelvic)

Phased array: fires elements at different times
Individual wave firing times can be adjusted to cause constructive and destructive wave summations&#224; steers and focuses the beam without having to move the probe.

title: "Transplant Ultrasound (Transplant)"

Normal liver doppler of the arteries should have a RAPID systolic upstroke
Systolic upstroke should take less than 80 msec (0.080)
Normal resistive indices is between 0.5-0.7
Hepatic artery peak velocity should be &lt; 200 cm/sec 

Syndrome of impending thrombosis:
1. 3-10 days post transplant
2. 1st wave form is normal
3. 2nd No diastolic flow (this makes sense that diastolic flow would go first)
4. Dampening systolic flow (indicated by tardus parvus wave form and/or RI &lt;0.5)
5. Last, loss of hepatic waveform

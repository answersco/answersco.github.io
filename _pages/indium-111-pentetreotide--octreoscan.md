title: "Indium 111 pentetreotide (octreoscan)"
---
Carcinoid detection primarily
cyclotron production
decay by e- capture, emitting 2 photons: 173 and 247 keV
67 hr half life
somatostatin receptors, incl amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD)
carcinoid, islet cell, gastrinoma, insulinoma, glomus tumors of head/neck (extra-adrenal pheos), paraganglioma
distribution: rena;, splenic &gt; hepatic

Primarily used to image carcinoid
Indium 111 is cyclotron produced
Decays by electron capture&#8594; emits 2 photons at 173 and 247 keV
T1/2 = 67 hours
Pentetreotide is an octreotide analog &#8594; can detect tumors with somatostatin receptors, including APUD tumors
Most commonly used to evaluate carcinoid or islet cell tumors
Good for imaging gastrinoma, with relatively reduced sensitivity for insulinoma.
Glomus tumors of the head and neck (extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas) are seen better with indium-111 pentetreotide than MIBG, though still uncommonly performed.
Normal distribution: intense renal and splenic uptake, with slightly less hepatic uptake. Also physiologic uptake in pituitary, thyroid, urinary tract, and bowel.
Specificity for carcinoid is only ~50%, especially when a hot spot is near a region of physiologic uptake in the pituitary, thyroid, liver, spleen, GU tract, or bowel. False positives may occur in benign processes such as inflammation, Graves disease, and sarcoidosis.

title: "Vessel selection for GI bleeding at angiography"
---
Suspected level of bleeding within the GI tract determines which vessel to select:
-Celiac artery for UGI sources
-IMA for sigmoid and rectum (must include anal verge)
-SMA for small bowel and R colon.

-With occlusion of IMA, the SMA injection frequently suffices to evaluate the left colon and sigmoid.
-Celiac injection should be included for lower GI bleeding when SMA and IMA injections are negative because the middle colic artery is replaced to the dorsal pancreatic artery in 1-2% of patients.
-Hypogastric artery injection may be necessary to exclude rectosigmoid bleeding when there is occlusion of IMA.

Most aneurysms &gt;/= 6 cm warrant consideration for surgical repair

Severe aortic valvular stenosis may lead to post-stenotic dilatation of ascending aorta.

Marfan: characteristically shows dilation of aortic valve and effacement of the sinotubular ridge, though this may be seen with other connective disorders.
May see isolated ectasia of aortic root without other manifestations of Marfan.
Less commonly dilation of aortic root and sinotubular ectasia can be seen in other heritable and some connective tissue disorders, such as OI, Ehlers-Danlos, and RA.

Takayasu arteritis: rarely have fusiform ascending Ao aneurysms with characteristic thickening of aortic wall.

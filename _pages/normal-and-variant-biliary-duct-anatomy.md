Ductal anatomy mimics segmental anatomy
2 main ducts (right and left) form CHD

Right hepatic duct: 
-Horizontal right posterior (segments 6 and 7) duct
-Vertical right anterior (segments 5 and 8)

Left hepatic duct: has a horizontal course and drains segments 2 and 4.

Most common variant: right posterior segment branch draining the left hepatic lobe.

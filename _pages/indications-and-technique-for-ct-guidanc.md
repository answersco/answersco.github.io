title: "Indications and technique for CT-guidance in perc gastrostomy"
---
CT guidance may be used for gastrostomy in:
-Patients with no safe perc access route to stomach by fluoro guidance.
-Patients in whom NG tube can't be placed due to esophageal obstruction
-Patients with very scaphoid abdomen with stomach tucked up underneath ribcage.
-Patients who have failed PEG because of poor transillumination from the stomach to the anterior abdominal wall.
-Sometimes in patients with prior gastric surgery.

Technique:
-For patients without NG tube and inability to ingest carbonated granules, a 22-gauge Chiba needle inserted into stomach via CT guidance.
-Contrast injected to confirm position.
-Air injected through the 22-gauge needle to distend the stomach.
-0.018 guidewire placed through needle into stomach
-5-French introducer sheath placed over guidewire, which is exchanged for a 0.038 inch J-guidewire.
-Patient moved to fluoro for completion of procedure.

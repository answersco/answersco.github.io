title: "IMPORTANT: What does increasing SID (source to image distance) mean in terms of SOD and ODD?"
---
Increased SID increases the SOD, while maintaining the ODD constant. Therefore, you get LESS focal spot blurring (and LESS mag)

* More Mag = More focal spot blurring

Practical example: Keep hand same distance from the wall, but move the flashlight way back

Xenon-133 (ventilation)
Inhaled gas with physical half-life of 5.3 days
Biologic half-life is short because the majority is exhaled
Emits 81 keV gamma photons, and is also a beta-emitter
Critical organ: trachea
10-20 mCi is administered, but there is very little radiation exposure
Must be administered in a negative pressure room to prevent accidental leakage.
Imaged posteriorly to avoid breast artifacts, as the relatively low keV is easily attenuated by soft tissue
Washin-washout imaging&#8594; can be performed to evaluate for air-trapping (common in COPD)
Requires good patient cooperation
Exhaled xenon-133 &#8594; must be carefully disposed of, either exhausted to the atmosphere or trapped in a charcoal trap until it decays
Tc-99m DTPA (ventilation)
Technetium-labeled aerosol
Unlike xenon-133, DTPA does not allow for dynamic washin-washout imaging.
Once inhaled, the particles remain in place for ~ 20-60 minutes
30 mCi typically administered
Greater ease of use than Xenon
Advantages include the ability to image in multiple projections, no need for exhaust systems, and ability to use portably.

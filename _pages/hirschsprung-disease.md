title: "Hirschsprung Disease"
---
Denervated colon is small caliber, spasmodic
Innervated more proximal colon is dilated
In newborn: Multiple loops of dilated bowel
Outside neonatal period: Large stool burden in innervated colon with varying degrees of dilation
Contrast enema particularly useful in neonatal distal bowel obstruction (excludes other causes)
Rectum smaller than sigmoid (R/S ratio &lt; 1)
Transition zone: Change in caliber from small distal colon to dilated proximal colon

Hirschsprung disease:
Up to &#8531; develop a form of enterocolitis similar to NEC, with toxic megacolon representing the fulminant form &#8594; should be considered in neonate with bowel obstruction and colitis.
XR&#8594; distal obstruction pattern
Contrast enema&#8594; typically shows a cone-shaped transition zone at the junction of the spastic, narrowed distal colon and the dilated proximal colon.
Abnormal rectosigmoid ratio &lt; 1 (i.e. with rectum smaller than sigmoid)
Initial enema may be normal in neonates with ultrashort segment involvement.
Unlike functional immaturity of the colon, Hirschsprung disease tends to cause a tapered, rather than an abrupt transition zone.

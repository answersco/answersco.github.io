title: "Tc-99m HMPAO WBC, what is the imaging protocol, timing, photopeaks, collimation?"
---
Tc-99m is preferred over In-111 due to shorted preparation and imaging times. Preferred for imaging of IBD. Image abd/pelv early, before 4 hrs when normal bowel excretion is expected. Photo peak is 140keV. High res/low energy collimator is used. Delayed images obtained at 16-24 hrs.

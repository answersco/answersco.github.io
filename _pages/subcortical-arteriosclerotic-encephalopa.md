- May also be called Binswanger disease
- Best thought of as a vascular dementia that ONLY involves the WHITE MATTER (preferentially the centrum semiovale, i.e., white matter superior to the lateral ventricles and corpus collosum)
- SPARES the subcortical U fibers
- Strong association with hypertension and older age 
- If they show you a case that looks like SAE but is in young person with migraines then they are leading you to CADASIL

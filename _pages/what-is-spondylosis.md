title: "What is spondylosis?"
---
effaced cerebral spinal fluid in the spinal canal associated with cord intramedullary T2 hyperintensity represents myelomalacia or edema. There is narrowing of the subarachnoid space due to ventral and dorsal epidural disease. Ventral low T2 signal is due to the disc/osteophyte complex. Dorsal low T2 signal is due to ligamentous thickening.

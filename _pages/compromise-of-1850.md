title: "Compromise of 1850"
---
Compromise created by Stephen Douglas to settle arguments in congress about what to do with the newly acquired states from Mexico. California would be a free state, and all others would be left for popular sovereignty. The federal government would assume all debts from Texas, slave trade would be banned in DC, and a more effective fugitive slave law would be passed. Was an ineffective treaty.

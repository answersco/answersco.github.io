---
Chemical shift MRI: when fat and water are contained within the same voxel, the out-of-phase images show fat drop-out because fat protons are more shielded and resonate at a slower frequency. Based on T1 images.
Adenomas: suppress on out-of-phase images
Metastases: typically do not suppress

Malignancies that contain intracytoplasmic lipid (also lose signal on out-of phase images)
Well-differentiated adrenocortical carcinoma (very rare)
Clear cell RCC metastatic to adrenal
HCC metastatic to adrenal
Liposarcoma

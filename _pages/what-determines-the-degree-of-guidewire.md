title: "What determines the degree of guidewire stiffness?"
---
The thickness and composition of the inner core determine the degree of guidewire thickness
-Flexible guidewires: important for negotiating tortuous or disease vessels
-Stiff guidewires (&quot;working wires&quot;): provide the most support for introducing catheters and devices
-Moveable core guidewire: provides variable stiffness via a core than can be slid in and out of the spring wrap.
-Mandril wire: springlike soft tip is limited to the tip, with the remainder of the guidewire consisting of a solid wire.

title: "IR in pelvic trauma:"
---
Pelvic trauma: 3 cm diastasis of symphysis pubis doubles the potential intrapelvic volume to ~8 L. 
Angiography usually performed prior to orthopedic surgery.
Technique: nonselective pelvic arteriogram, followed by selective bilateral internal iliac arteriograms of the anterior and posterior divisions.
Because of the rich collateral supply in the pelvis, rapid nonselective gelfoam embolization of either the entire anterior or posterior division of the internal iliac artery is often acceptable.

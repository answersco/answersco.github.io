title: "Appearance of Parathyroid adenoma"
---
A well define hypoechoic mass inferior to the lobe of the thyroid with a tissue plane (echogenic line) between the thyroid and the mass, confirming that the mass is separate from the thyroid. This is a classic ultrasound appearance of a parathyroid adenoma. Can be confirmed with serum parathyroid level; sestamibi scan could also confirm.

title: "In terms of nuclides, what is an Isomer?"
---
Isomers are nuclides that contain the same number of protons and the same number of neutrons but the isomer exists in an excited energy state.

When the excited state decays, a photon is emitted but there is not change in the number of protons or neutrons. Tc-99m decaying to Tc-99 through the emission of a 140 keV photon is an example of an isomer undergoing an isomeric transition.

True: 2 5ll keV photons from an annihilation reaction detected in the same coincident window

Scatter coincidence: one of the photons has a Compton interaction and is deflected, but still hits the detector within the coincident time window (just not in the calculated location).

Random coincidence: 2 photons from different annihilation reactions just happen to land within the same coincident window- creates the false calculation that they occurred from the same event.

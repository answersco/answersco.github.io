T2 dark area at 55 degree - will look bright
FIX- Lengthen TE or T1

This is an MSK finding where when things are curving you are going to get bright signal on sequences that have SHORT TE times (PD, T1, GRE)

55 degrees
Short TE sequences (T1, PD, GRE)
Fixed by:
- longer TE -&gt; not seen on T2
- higher field strength -&gt; greater shortening of T2

Normal tendon may have increased signal, tendons have fibers coursing along a single direction, they may have artifactually increased signal on short TE sequences (T1, PD, GRE) when oriented 55 degrees relative to the bore of the magnet.

title: "IMPORTANT: How do you improve your lateral resolution in ultrasound? (3 ways)"
---
For lateral resolution, you want 2 adjacent objects in the lateral direction to be in 2 different beams. Narrower beam is better!

Decrease the beam width, increase focusing, increase line density by narrowing element size (will make a narrow beam)

Note: Spatial pulse length affects the AXIAL resolution, not lateral

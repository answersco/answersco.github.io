title: "Renal TB"
---
Early: enlarged Late: small Eventually: Autonephrectomy
Parenchymal calcifications (putty kidney - calcs are homogenous, ground glass)
Papillary necrosis
Tuberculoma

Collecting system - irregular, infundibular stenosis, amputated calyx
Corkscrew ureter
Purse string stenosis of renal pelvis
Pipestem ureter

Renal TB: results from hematogenous dissemination
Initial renal TB infection involves both kidneys, but chronic changes tend to be unilateral
Imaging findings: parenchymal calcification, scarring, papillary necrosis, and infundibular strictures
End-stage TB: produces autonephrectomy&#8594; putty kidney appearance, which is atrophic and calcified.

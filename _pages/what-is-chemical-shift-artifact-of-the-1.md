title: "What is chemical shift artifact of the 1st kind?"
---
It is a spatial misregistration artifact in frequency encoding direction. It is the result of the inherent difference in Larmor frequency between fat and water. The difference in Larmor frequency is misinterpreted as a difference in location along the frequency encoding direction. Increasing receiver bandwidth decreases 1st kind chemical shift artifact.

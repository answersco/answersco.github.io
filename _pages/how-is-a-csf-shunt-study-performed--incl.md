title: "How is a CSF shunt study performed (including radiopharmaceutical used)?"
---
Tc99m-DTPA is injected into the CSF shunt reservoir by a physician using sterile technique. The reservoir is identified as a raised area over the scalp.
The patient should remain supine during the injection.
Dynamic imaging is then performed at a rate of 1 min/frame.
Opening pressure of the CSF reservoir can be used to reliably assess the patency of the proximal CSF tubing, indicated by normal or elevated opening pressure of the CSF shunt reservoir (elevated if &gt; 20 mmHg)

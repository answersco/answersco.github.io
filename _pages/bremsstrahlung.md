title: "Bremsstrahlung?"
---
e- from filament accelerated toward target (cathode) by high positive voltage. 
Interacts with target nucleus
e- slows losing kinetic energy in the form of a Bremsstrahlung x-ray photon
Energy spectrum:
0 - peak kilovoltage (kVp) applied to x-ray tube
Majority of x-ray photons are low energy &amp; do not escape x-ray tube
Electron exits atom with its energy reduced by that of the newly-formed Bremsstrahlung x-ray

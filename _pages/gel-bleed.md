Silicone molecules can (and do) pass through the semi-permeable implant shell
coating the exterior of the surface. This does NOT mean the implant is ruptured. The classic
look is to show you silicone in the axillary lymph nodes (remember I showed a case of this
under the lymph node section). Even with axillary lymph nodes, this does NOT mean it has
ruptured.

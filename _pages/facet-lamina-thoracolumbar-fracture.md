title: "Facet-Lamina Thoracolumbar Fracture"
---
Best diagnostic clue
Fractures of articular facets and lamina typically seen as components of more extensive patterns of thoracic and lumbar spine injury
Location
60% of thoracolumbar fractures located between T12 and L2
Rib cage and sternum provide structural stability to thoracic spine
Burst fracture
Axial loading injury, comminuted fracture of anterior and middle columns
Centrifugal displacement of fragments can cause lamina fracture(s)
Widening of interpediculate distances on radiography
Hyperflexion-distraction and Chance fractures
Forced flexion of spine around anterior fulcrum
Flexion-distraction: Diastatic (&gt; 2 mm), subluxed (articular apposition &lt; 50%), perched, or jumped facet joints
&quot;Naked facet&quot; sign on CT
Chance fracture: Horizontal fracture(s) through pedicles, articular pillar, lamina

title: "When is atypical lobular hyperplasia encountered? Why be concerned about it?"
---
Atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) is found in the terminal ductal lobular unit and is often an incidental finding at biopsy. When ALH is the most severe finding at core biopsy, excision is generally recommended due to the ~ 15% risk of upgrade to DCIS.

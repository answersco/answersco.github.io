ACR guidelines for communication of diagnostic imaging findings
Radiologists are advised to omit extraneous information and verbiage, and organize their reports in a clear, logical, and coherent fashion
Included as part of the ACR &quot;Imaging 3.0&quot; initiative
ACR practice guidelines: cover the fundamental components of a radiologist's report and outline how and when reporting outside the realm of the usual written report must be performed
Beyond these guidelines, ACR and other organizations have advocated for improving the quality, &quot;actionability,&quot; and clarity of reports, leading some practices to adopt a more structured style of reporting.

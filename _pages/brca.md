the two major breast-cancer susceptibility genes are BRCA1 and BRCA2(tumor suppressor):
1) BRCA1 encodes a protein that interacts with other proteins that counter DNA damage - can fix damaged double helix DNA - mostly breast but also involves uterine and ovarian 
-BRCA1 also controls cellular defense mechanisms 
2) BRCA2 mutation increases the risk of developing colon, kidney, prostate, pancreas, gallbladder, skin, or stomach cancer
-mutations in these genes have different incidences in different populations

petro-clival junction.

Rings and arc
Medullary location
Older individuals 

Factors favoring chondrosarcoma over enchondroma:

- PAIN
- Cortical distruction
- Scalloping of greater than 2/3 the cortex
- Size &gt; 5 cm
- Changing matrix

main ddx of chordoma in clivus, NEARLY ALWAYS lateral to midline, T2 bright, arcs &amp; rings matrix on CT

Chondrosarcoma: usually older adults, M&gt;F
Commonly flat bones, limb girdles, proximal tubular bones
Can be intramedullary or peripheral (at the end of an osteochondroma)
Most are low-grade
Risk factors: Pagets, anything cartilaginous (osteochondromas, maffucci's, etc)
Appearance suggesting chondroblastoma but in an adult, think clear cell chondrosarcoma

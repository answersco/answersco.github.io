title: "IMPORTANT: What is the amount of attenuation of US beam for soft tissue?"
---
0.5 dB/cm per MHz

e.g. 2 MHz Ultrasound beam will have twice the attenuation of a 1 MHz beam

(higher frequency = more attenuation = smaller half value thickness)
- this is why you use high frequency for SUPERFICIAL structures (depth sucks because of so much attenuation)

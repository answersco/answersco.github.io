title: "State the joint classification by structural classification (4) and by functional classification aka by how they move (3) and finally by their anatomy (number of articulation surfaces) (3)"

Structural classification: 
1) synovial (not directly joined) - there is a synovial cavity in between the bones
2) facet joint: a joint between 2 articular processes between 2 vertebrae
3) cartilaginous joint - 2 separate joints are joined by cartilage
4) fibrous joint - the bones are joined by a dense regular connective tissue that is rich in collagen fibers

functional classification:

1) synarthrosis - permits little or no mobility. Most synarthrosis joints are fibrous joints (ie, skull sutures)

2) amphiarthrosis - permits SLIGHT mobility. Most amphiarthrosis joints are CARTILAGINOIS joints (ie invtervertebral disks)

3) diarthrosis (freely movable) - these are synarthrosis joints. They are characterized into 6 subgroups - plane joint, hinge joint, pivot joint, condyloid joint, saddle joint, and ball &amp; socket joint

Biomechanical joint:

1) Simple - 2 articulation surfaces
2) Compound - 3 or more articulation surfaces (radiocarpal joint)
3) Complex joint (2 ore more articulation surfaces, PLUS an articular DISC or MENISCUS (ie, knee joint)

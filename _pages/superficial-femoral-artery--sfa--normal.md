SFA: almost complete lack of variability
-Originates from CFA anterior and medial to the PFA.
-SFA runs beneath the sartorius muscle in the thigh, anterior to the femoral vein
-Passes through the adductor canal in the distal thigh before becoming the popliteal artery.
-Usually 5-7 mm diameter
-Many muscular branches along its length that become important collateral pathways in setting of occlusive disease
-Descending or supreme genicular artery: the last large medial branch.

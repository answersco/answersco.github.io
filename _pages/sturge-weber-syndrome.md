title: "Sturge-Weber Syndrome"
---
Skin and meningeal angiomatous lesions. Port-wine nevus: skin angioma in ophthalmic division of trigeminal nerve. Pial angiomas may result in chronic ischemia, gliosis, and gyral cortical calcifications. Enlargement of deep and subependymal veins may mimic arteriovenous malformations.

Also known as encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis, Sturge-Weber syndrome is due to congenital failure of the cortical veins to develop. A facial port-wine stain in the trigeminal distribution is common (98%). Gyral calcification can be seen on CT, as demonstrated in this case. Extensive calcifications can produce the classic &quot;tram-track&quot; appearance on plain skull radiographs. Pial angiomatosis produces the pattern of leptomeningeal enhancement along the affected hemisphere and atrophy of the affected hemisphere occurs over time, both seen here. The choroid plexus is often enlarged and hypervascular on the affected side, also seen in this case. Choroidal angiomas can be seen in the eyes. Seizures and hemiparesis are the most common clinical symptoms.

- Ipsilateral cortical volume loss
- Tram track calcifications
- Hyperostosis of the inner table

Physical exam: you can see port wine stain which is a facial angiomatosis

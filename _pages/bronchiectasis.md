- Postinfectious (bacterial, TB, MAC)
- Cystic Fibrosis
- ABPA
= Obstructive lesion/mass
= Ciliary dyskinesia

Permanent dilation of bronchi. Cylindric bronchiectasis: mild diffuse dilation. Varicose bronchiectasis: cystic dilation interrupted by focal areas of narrowing. Cystic bronchiectasis: localized saccular dilation. Caused by chronic inflammation with cartilage damage and dilation. Localized bronchiectasis is most commonly a result of prior TB. Generalized bronchiectasis is seen in cystic fibrosis. Central bronchiectasis: Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Cystic fibrosis. Bronchial atresia. Acquired central bronchial obstruction.

1. Cystic Fibrosis

3. Chronic aspiration
4. Chroinic infection
5. Inhalation injury

What is your diagnosis?

chronic dilation of the bronchial tree 
ex: patients who have recurrent bronchitis can develop it

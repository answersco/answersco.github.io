title: "NEC for PET?"

Noise equivalent counting rate. describes the equivalent coincidence counting rate that would have the same noise properties as the net true counting rate, corrected for spurious coincidences arising from 2 particular sources: random (accidental) coincidences and scattered events. NEC can also be seen as being directly proportional to the square of the signal-to-noise ratio of the acquired data.

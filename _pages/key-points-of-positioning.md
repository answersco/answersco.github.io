title: "Key points of positioning"
---
1) turn patients at least every 2 hours
-documentation is extremely important especially for positioning (8 am on back, 9 am on left side, etc.), not documented then not done
-hospital wants to show we are concerned with the skin integrity of pt's
2) encourage or perform ROM when turning or bathing.
-engage them to help with activities - give them the washcloth and have them reach the right hand to left shoulder bc it it ROM exercises but also helps by seeing what they can do
3) cushion pressure points.
-put protectors on bony prominences or elevate limbs
4) maintain special mattresses.
5) use assistive devices.
-if someone is confused or not able to help, a sling can be helpful

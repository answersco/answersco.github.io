title: "Time Gain Compensation?"
---
Additional amplification, called time gain compensation (TGC) is needed as the depth increases due to attenuation and scatter. These are the sliders along the right of the image, ie depth relative gain control.

This basically makes the entire image uniform by changing the amount of amplification based on depth
Purpose is uniform brightness from top to bottom

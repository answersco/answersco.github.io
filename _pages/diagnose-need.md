Step 2 of the Planned Change Process
-analyzing symptoms/behaviors and conclude what the issue is
-describe the situation now and compare it with the ideal situation
-literature reviews must be done to get the most up to date data (called EBP).
-with the interviews and the data collection, the nurse will then create a diagnosis statement

EX. a local school teacher needs help in reinforcing hand washing to her students. The nurse will need to go to the classroom and assess the students, question the teacher to get information. The nurse may then go to the literature and gather data on handwashing, how to teach handwashing to children, and the normal learning process for childhood learning

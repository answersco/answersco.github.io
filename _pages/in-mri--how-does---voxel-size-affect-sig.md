title: "In MRI, how does &#8593; voxel size affect signal intensity and noise?"

Answer: signal intensity &#8593;, but noise is independent of voxel size
In MRI, signal intensity &#8593; with the # of excited photons contributing to the echo. Since &#8593; voxel size &#8593; the # of photons contributing to the echo, it also &#8593; the SI.
In CT, when you &#8593; the signal you automatically &#8595; the noise (or mottle). 
In MRI, on the other hand, noise tends to be independent of the voxel volume. Instead, it is a function of receiver bandwidth and RF coil characteristics.

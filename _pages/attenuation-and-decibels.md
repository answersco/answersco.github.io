title: "Attenuation and decibels:"
---
Relative sound levels are measured in decibels
In general, a 3dB change is equivalent to a change in sound intensity by a factor of 2
General rule of thumb: attenuation of the US beam in soft tissue is approximately 0.5 dB/cm/Hz
To estimate the attenuation in dB, multiply this value by the total distance the sound traveled (distance from transducer x 2) and by the frequency of the transducer.

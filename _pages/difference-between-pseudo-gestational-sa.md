title: "Difference between pseudo gestational sac and anembryonic pregnancy?"
---
Anembryonic pregnancy is a gestiaonl sac without an embryo (either very early or non-viable; should see yolk sac when GSac is 8 mm by TV)

Pseudogestaional sac = small amt of blood in uterine cavity with surrounding bright decidual endometrium (due to ECTOPIC pregnancy!)

title: "Driver mutation"
---
-provides the selective growth advantage to a cell that defines the cancerous state
-oncogenes turned on or tumor suppressor genes turned off which can be generated from abnormal chromosomes

1) cumulative effect
-&quot;gatekeeper&quot; enables a normal epithelial to divide slightly faster than others
-clone of faster-dividing cells gradually accumulates
-second mutation boosts the division rate
2) driver mutations can be identified by:
-comparing mutations in tumor cells from people at different stages of the same cancer
-studying cancer cells of patients who respond to a drug and then relapse

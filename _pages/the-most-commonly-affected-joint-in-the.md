title: "The most commonly affected joint in the foot affected by OA (and which toe)?"
---
The MTP of the great toe, which may lead to hallux rigid (a stiff big toe) from dorsal osteophytes

**This is interesting, as the MCP is not usually affected in OA (in the hands), BUT, the metaTARSALphalangeal joint is the most commonly affected joint in the foot

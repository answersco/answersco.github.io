title: "What imaging sequence is the technique of choice for DWI?"
---
Echo planar imaging (EPI): 
Can be done with SE (90+180) or GRE (90 + a bunch of gradients)
Fastest MRI acquisition method- 1 RF pulse used to acquire data for an image (AKA single shot)
Works by rapidly turning the phase and frequency encoding gradients on and off- fast filling of k-space.

Compared to GRE, EPI is more susceptible to magnetic susceptibility, gives better tissue contrast, and is faster.

Artifacts linked to EPI:
-Magnetic susceptibility- can be improved with segmented sequences instead of single shots
-Ghosting: gradient imperfections mess with spatial encoding
-Chemical shift (due to use of narrow readout bandwidth)

DWI: base sequence uses either fast GRE or EPI

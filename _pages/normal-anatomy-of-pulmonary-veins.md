Typically one upper and 2 lower veins are formed from coalescence of the segmental veins in each lung.
RML usually drains into the upper vein, but may empty directly into LA.
Anomalous venous drainage to SVC, systemic thoracic veins, or coronary sinus may be found in association with CHD, pulmonary sequestration, or as isolated occurrence.

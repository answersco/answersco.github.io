title: "3 configurations of AAA endografts"
---
Bifurcated extending into either the CIAs or EIAs
-Most common
-Usually modular in construction (assembled in the patient)

Aortounilateral iliac (AUNI) graft with surgical fem-fem bypass
-Used when patient's anatomy isn't suited to a bifurcated graft

Tube graft: rarely used owing to lack of adequate distal landing zones in the aorta below the aneurysm

Endografts that can accommodate branch arteries are becoming available and increase the spectrum of patients that can be treated.

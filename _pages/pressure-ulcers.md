title: "Pressure ulcers"
---
1) pressure intensity
-blanching (turns lighter in color)
-external pressure is greater than the capillary pressure inside the tissue causing no circulation, quickly leading to cell death and tissue necrosis
2) pressure duration: tissue tolerance, t&amp;p q2h, some more frequent, use of pillows to support natural curvature (under shoulders and under sacrum)
-#1 intervention for pressure ulcers is to prevent them bc once its there it takes a lot of time and work to reverse it
-massage, lotions, keep it dry, skin barrier, nutrition, movement, specialty mattress, seating cushion, t&amp;p

-also known as decubineous ulcers or bed sores
-when staging ulcers, you're assessing how much tissue damage has occurred
-multifactorial for pressure ulcers to develop so time when they develop is hard to determine

title: "Phase-contrast MRI (pc-MRI):"
---
Technique for noninvasive assessment of hemodynamics.
The PC image provides a method of quantifying flowing blood through vessels. By measuring the phase shift that occurs as protons in the blood move through a magnetic field, the velocity and direction of the blood can be obtained.
Stationary tissues appear gray, while tissue moving through the plane appears as shades of either white or black, depending on the direction.

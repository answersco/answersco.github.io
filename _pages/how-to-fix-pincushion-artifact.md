DECREASE FOV


A pincushion artifact is what is described in the question stem, which is due to the curvature of the input phosphor which causes a distortion and greater distance between equidistant points at the periphery of the image compared to the center. 

This is seen with systems with larger field of views, so one way to decrease this artifact is to decrease the field of view.

title: "Normal bowel rotation pattern in development? What if non-rotated?"
---
Normally rotates 270 degrees COUNTERclockwise about the SMA/SMV and is done by weeks 10-12
- results in long, broad based mesentery 

Think of Non-rotation as it only rotates 180 degrees, resulting in small bowel in right abdomen and large bowel in left 
- repair only if symptomatic

Ependymoma&#8594; most common intramedullary tumor in adults
Associated with NF2, especially when seen in children.
Often hemorrhagic, leading to a heterogeneous MRI appearance.
Peripheral hemosiderin deposition causes a dark rim on T2.
Most enhance.
Classically extensive formation of both tumoral cysts and nontumoral polar cysts. Tumoral cysts are surrounded by enhancement and must be resected with the mass.
Classic XR finding: scalloping of the vertebral bodies (rarely seen).

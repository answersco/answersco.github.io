title: "Differential diagnosis of primary pediatric liver mass based on age and lab values"
---
Child &gt; 5 years of age
HCC: the only pediatric primary hepatic tumor commonly occurring in children &gt; 5 years of age. Peak incidence of 10-15 years.
ELEVATED AFP
Solid, arterially enhancing mass in cirrhotic liver.

3 primary masses in children &lt; 5 years of age
Mesenchymal hamartoma: normal AFP
Tumors have prominent CYSTIC component

Infantile hemangioendothelioma: AFP usually normal, but VEGF may be elevated
Highly vascular solid mass with areas of HIGH DOPPLER FLOW representing AV fistulas (may cause high-output heart failure)

Hepatoblastoma: 90% with elevated AFP
Solid, enhancing mass in child &lt; 4 years of age

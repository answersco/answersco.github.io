title: "WHat type of contrast is most and least likely to cause NSF, and what is the GFR limit"
---
No gad for GFR &lt; 30
NSF risk related to chelation structure, not the actual Gadolinium.

Most likely to cause = linear non-ionic
-Omniscan, optimark
Intermediate risk = linear ionic
-Multihance, magnevist
Lowest risk = cyclic structure
-Gadovist

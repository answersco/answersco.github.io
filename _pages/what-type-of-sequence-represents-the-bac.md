title: "What type of sequence represents the backbone of cine cardiac MRI?"
---
Steady State Free Precession (SSFP) &#8594; backbone of cine cardiac MRI
SSFP sequences include Balanced Fast-Field Echo (FFE), FIESTA, and TrueFISP.
SSFP: a modification of GRE imaging that produces bright blood images with excellent contrast between myocardium and blood within the heart (blood-pool)
Relatively fast acquisition.
Image quality depends greatly on the homogeneity of the magnetic field
High temporal resolution and excellent contrast&#8594; good for evaluation of wall motion and volumetric measurements

title: "Hepatic hemangioma"

T1-Hypo, T2- hyper, +C- interuptted peripheral nodular enhancement

Most common liver lesion
Ultrasound: hyper echogenic UNLESS you are looking at a background fatty liver, will see blood vessels around the lesion but NOT in the lesion itself
CT: Peripheral discontiguous enhancement which should totally fill in @ 15 minutes. The enhancement should match that of aortic blood pool on all phases (or be close)

Pearls:

- If need to bx, you have to core as FNA just gets blood
- Atypical US appearance can be hyperechoic periphery with internal hypoechoic spot 
- Calcifications are extremely rare

title: "Gallium half-life and decay; critical organ"
---
Gallium: produced in cyclotron via bombardment of Zn68
Half-life of 78 hours
Decays by electron capture: emits gamma rays at 4 photopeaks
93 keV (40%), 184 (20%) keV, 300 (17%) keV, and 393 (5%) keV.
Images typically not performed sooner than 24 hours due to high background

Critical organ = colon

Normal localization: liver (highest uptake), bone marrow, spleen, salivary glands, lacrimal glands, breasts.
Kidneys and bladder in 1st 24 hours (faintly up to 72)
Faint uptake in lungs in &lt;24 hours
Some bowel uptake after 24 hours
Children: growth plates and thymus.

Renal uptake: normal at 24 hours
Abnormal after 48 hours.

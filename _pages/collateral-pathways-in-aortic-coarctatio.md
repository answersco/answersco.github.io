title: "Collateral pathways in aortic coarctation: proximal descending thoracic Ao"
---
More common location for coarctation is proximal descending thoracic Ao just beyond left subclavian artery.
This results in hypertrophy of both subclavian arteries and their muscular branches.
Reversal of flow in intercostal arteries distal to the obstruction (usually beginning with intercostal artery pair at T4), which are supplied from the internal mammary and other chest wall muscular arteries.
Both internal mammary arteries supply the lower extremities via the epigastric arteries.

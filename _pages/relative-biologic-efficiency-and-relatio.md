title: "Relative biologic efficiency and relationship with LET"
---
RBE: relative capability of radiation with differing LETs to produce a different biologic reaction.

RBE = dose of 250 kV x-rays / Dose in Gy of test radiation
-Use dose of 250 kV x-rays required to produce the same effect.

As LET increases, RBE will increase to a point
-Above 100 keV/micrometer, RBE decreases with increasing LET because the maximum potential damage has already been done, and any additional increase in LET is wasted dose.

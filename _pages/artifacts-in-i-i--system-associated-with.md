Pincushion distortion: 
With large FOV may see appearance of bent lines at the periphery (should be straight).
Inward bowing pattern may resemble a pincushion

S-Shaped Distortion: similar to pincushion, and also with larger FOV
Due to interference of the earth's magnetic field with the flow of electrons heading toward the I.I.
Adding &quot;mu metal&quot; can supposedly deflect the magnetic field and improve this.

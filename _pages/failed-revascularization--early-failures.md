title: "Failed revascularization: early failures"
---
Most early failures (0-30 days) due to technical issues: 
-Occlusive dissection adjacent to the intervention that impedes flow
-Elastic recoil of a fibrotic lesion
-Missed lesion that continues to impair flow
-Vessel spasm
-Thrombosis (e.g. from hypercoagulable syndromes, episodes of hypotension, or other low-flow states) can occur at any time

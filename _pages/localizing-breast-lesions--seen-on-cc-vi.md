title: "Localizing breast lesions (seen on CC view)"
---
You can do rolled CC views
-Remember you are going to rotate the breast (along the axis of the nipple) either medial or lateral
- Remember the reference point is the TOP of the breast

- SUPERIOR lesions will move TOWARDS the direction you roll
- INFERIOR lesions will move AWAY the direction you roll

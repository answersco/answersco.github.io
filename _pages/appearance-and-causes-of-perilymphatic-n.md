title: "Appearance and causes of perilymphatic nodules:"
---
Perilymphatic nodules: follow the anatomic locations of pulmonary lymphatics, which can be seen in 3 locations&#8594; subpleural, peribronchovascular, and septal 
Sarcoidosis: by far most common causes, typically with upper-lobe distribution
Nodules may become confluent&#8594; create the galaxy sign
Pneumoconioses (silicosis and CWP): imaging may look identical to sarcoidosis with perilymphatic nodules, but there is usually a history of exposure
Lymphangitis carcinomatosis

title: "Example problem: A reaction is produced by 5 Gy of test radiation. It takes 10 Gy of 250 kVp xrays to produce the same reaction. What is the RBE?"
---
RBE = dose of 250 kV xrays/dose (Gy) of test radiation

10 Gy / 5 Gy = 2 = RBE
(Test radiation is 2 times as effective in producing the biologic react that the &quot;standard&quot; 250 kVp xrays)

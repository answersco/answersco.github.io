Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is classified as a World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV neoplasm. They are rapidly enlarging malignant, diffusely infiltrating astrocytic tumors, characterized by necrosis and neovascularity. There are 2 types of GBM: primary (de novo) and secondary (degeneration from lower grade astrocytoma). GBM disseminates most commonly along the white matter tracts. Dissemination along the ependymal/subpial spread, CSF, and perivascular spaces is less common. Treatment includes biopsy/tumor debulking followed by radiation and chemotherapy.

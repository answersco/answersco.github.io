Per NCRP recommendations&#8594; a risk-benefit decision should be considered when the TI (thermal index) exceeds a value of 1.0 and the MI (mechanical index) exceeds 0.5.
Acoustic energy &gt; 100 mW/cm2 &#8594; can cause a rise of 2 degrees C.
Amplitudes &lt; 0.3 Mpa (megapascal) &#8594; result in minimal non-thermal (mechanical) damage.

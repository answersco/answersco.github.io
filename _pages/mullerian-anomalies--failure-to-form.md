Mullerian ducts &#8594; uterus, fallopian tubes, upper &#8532; of vagina
Mullerian agenesis (Mayer Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser)
Vaginal atresia
Absent or rudimentary uterus (uni- or bicornuate)
Normal ovaries
~50% with ipsilateral renal issues (agenesis, ectopia)

Unicornuate uterus: 4 subtypes (basically +/- rudimentary horn, +/- endometrial tissue)
Endometrial tissue in a non-communicating horn &#8594; pelvic pain
Endometrial tissue in rudimentary horn (communicating or not) &#8594; increased risk of miscarriage and uterine rupture.
40% with renal issues (usually agenesis) ipsilateral to rudimentary horn.

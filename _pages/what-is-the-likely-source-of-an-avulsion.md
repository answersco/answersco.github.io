title: "What is the likely source of an avulsion injury located lateral/cephalad to the lateral malleolus?"
---
Superior peroneal retinaculum avulsion: suspected when there is an avulsed fragment lateral/cephalad to the lateral malleolus.

Lateral peroneal tendon displacement due to superior peroneal retinaculum disruption requires surgical fixation to restore the position and function of the peroneal tendons.

May represent ankle sprain with injury to the anterior talofibular and/or calcaneofibular ligaments.

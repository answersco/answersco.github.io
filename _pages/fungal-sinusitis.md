Chronic allergic fungal sinusitis&#8594; noninvasive disease
Imaging: affected sinus is expanded and airless, with thin, deossified walls.
Sinus contents are typically mixed attenuation with heterogeneous curvilinear high attenuation.

Acute invasive fungal sinusitis&#8594; aggressive infection, usually in immunosuppressed patients &#8594; most frequently Aspergillus or Zygomycetes.
Early invasive disease&#8594; shows nonspecific sinus mucosal thickening.
Later in the disease process&#8594; local invasion, bone destruction, intracranial and/or intraorbital spread.
Unlike chronic allergic fungal sinusitis, invasive fungal sinusitis is not hyperdense on CT.

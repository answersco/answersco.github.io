title: "Describe amorphous vs fine pleomorphic vs coarse heterogeneous calcs?"
---
- Amorphous = powdered sugar (fibrocystic change, sclerosing adenosis, columnar cell change, DCIS)

- Coarse heterogeneous = countable with DULL TIPS &gt; 0.5 mm (fibroadenoma, papilloma, fibrocystic change, DCIS)

- Fine pleomorphic = countable with SHARP TIPS &lt; 0.5 mm (DCIS, fibrocystic change, less likely Fibroadenoma or papillloma)

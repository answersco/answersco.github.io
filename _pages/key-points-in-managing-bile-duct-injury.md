Important to delineate anatomy by PTC or prior imaging.

Define the site and nature of bile duct
-If the bile duct is intact and there is leakage only from the cystic duct stump, then ERCP is appropriate.
-If bile duct has been injured and there is associated leakage, then drainage and stenting are best performed percutaneously.
-In setting of bile duct ligation (often due to aberrant biliary anatomy), the intrahepatic BDs can be drained with an external biliary drainage catheter placed above the level of the ligation. Any associated leakage can be drained percutaenously. The patient will return weeks later for definitive reconstruction.

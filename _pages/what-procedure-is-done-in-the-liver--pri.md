title: "What procedure is done in the liver, prior to planned hepatic resection?"
---
Portal vein embolization (PVE) is increasingly being accepted as a useful procedure in the preoperative treatment of patients selected for major hepatic resection, to induce hepatic hypertrophy of the part to remain.

- also decreases risk of big bleed during resection

- Surgery is usually performed 4-5 weeks after PVE which allows sufficient time for hypertrophy of FRL to occur, but limits time for tumor growth that might potentially preclude resection.

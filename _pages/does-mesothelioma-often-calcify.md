title: "Does mesothelioma often calcify?"
---
No!! The calcified pleural plaques of asbestos are NOT associated with mesothelioma

Therefore the differential for thick pleural nodularity is mesothelioma or invasive thymoma.
- It's Invasive thymoma if there's a focus of calcification in the mediastinum

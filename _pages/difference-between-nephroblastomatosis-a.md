Neprhoblastomatosis = Persistent nephrogenic rests BEYOND 36 weeks! (precursor to Wilms)
- should not be necrotic
- homogeneous, focal homogeneous ball - diffuse perilobar rind (&quot;hypodense rind&quot; of kidney)
- ultrasound screening q3 months til age 7 --&gt; because risk of becoming WILMS


Mesoblastic nephroma = SOLID renal MEDULLARY tumor of infancy = fetal hamartoma is benign 
- Claw sign, possible at 1 day old, can have CYSTIC and HEMORRHAGIC FOCI if specific subtype
- US &quot;Concentric echogenic &amp; hypo echoic rings&quot;
- may look like Wilms, but TOO YOUNG a patient
- Do well after nephrectomy!

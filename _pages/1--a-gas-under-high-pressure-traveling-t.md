title: "1. A gas under high pressure traveling through a porous plug into an area of lower pressure allows the gas to expand and become cooler (Joule-Thomson effect) 2. Argon gas at +/- 160&#8304; C is used to form &quot;ice ball&quot; as a marker for tumor margins (approx. 10 minutes), followed by thawing using helium (approx. 8 minutes) 3. Basically: Freeze --&gt; Thaw --&gt; Freeze 4. Creates osmotic shifts resulting in cellular membrane ruption, and ultimately cell death. The resulting endothelial damage leads to platelet aggregation and microthrombosis"

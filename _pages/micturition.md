---
-process of emptying the bladder
1) detrusor muscle contracts, internal sphincter relaxes, urine enters posterior urethra
2) muscles of perineum and external sphincter relax
3) muscle of abdominal wall contracts slightly

-when you do not empty your bladder all the way, you are at increased risk for infection from the stagnate urine left behind

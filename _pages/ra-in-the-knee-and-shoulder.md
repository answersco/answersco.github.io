title: "RA in the knee and shoulder:"
---
All 3 joint spaces of knee may be affected by RA. In contrast, OA tends to first affect the medial tibiofemoral articulation. 
If osteophytes and symmetrical cartilage space narrowing are present, then secondary OA should be considered.
Unlike the smaller joints affected by RA, erosions are not a prominent manifestation of RA in the knee.

RA in shoulder:
RA causes chronic rotator cuff tears&#8594; classic high-riding humerus
Erosions tend to occur in the lateral aspect of the humeral heads
At AC joint&#8594; erosion may lead to &quot;penciling&quot; of the distal clavicle.

---
Both: intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic multifocal strictures

AIDS: focal strictures of extrahepatic duct &gt; 2 cm
Absent saccular deformities of the ducts
Associated PAPILLARY STENOSIS 60%)

PSC: extrahepatic strictures rarely &gt; 5 mm
Saccular deformities of the ducts
&quot;Cirrhotic pattern with central regenerative hypertrophy&quot;
20% recurrence after transplantation.
-Dilated intrahepatic BDs is rare in all forms of cirrhosis except PSC.

PBC has NORMAL EXTRAHEPATIC DUCTS, and 95% have anti-mitochondrial antibodies. Excellent prognosis, and responds well to medical tx.
Increased risk of HCC (cholangio in PSC)

title: "What measurements are used for diagnosis of tardus parvus"
---
Tardus = slowed systolic upstroke
Measured by acceleration time: time from end diastole to first systolic peak
Acceleration time &gt; 0.07 sec correlates with 50% stenosis of renal artery

Parvus = decreased systolic velocity
Measured by acceleration index: change in velocity from end-diastole to first systolic peak
Acceleration index &lt; 3.0 m/sec correlates with &gt; 50% stenosis of renal artery.

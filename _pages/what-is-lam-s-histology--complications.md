title: "What is LAM's histology? Complications?"
---
LAM is due to interstitial proliferation of abnormal smooth muscle resulting in dilated pulmonary lymphatics.

- It can actually also present as b/l reticulonodular densities with hyperinflation on CXR

- Recurrent pneumothorax and chylothorax are complications

- Women of CHILD-BEARING age (almost exclusively!)

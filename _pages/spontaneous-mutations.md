title: "Spontaneous mutations"
---
-de novo or new mutations
-not inherited
-not caused by exposure to known mutagen

They are errors in DNA replication:
-DNA bases have slight chemical instability
-exist in slightly different forms called tautomers (mismatch base pairs)
-as replication fork encounters unstable tautomers, mispairing can occur

title: "In general terms, how does the mullerian ducts form the kidneys and uterus?"
---
embryologic cells begin at the site of the kidneys (bowls of soup) and track downward to the pelvis (soup poured down) where the uterus will eventually live

the two halves (of embryological soup) of the cells in the pelvis are just &quot;mashed&quot; together and have two separate parts, so there needs to be a cleaving to make a single uterine cavity

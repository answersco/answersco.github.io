title: "Lobar Collapse (atelectasis)"
---
Collapsed lobes are the result of an obstruction of a proximal airway, the reasons for which vary depending on the patient's history&#8212;for example, possibly a mucus plug in a patient with severe pneumonia or an inhaled foreign body in a child. In an older patient with lobar collapse on a chest radiograph with no obvious cause, bronchial cancer must always be suspected, especially where there is a history of smoking. The patient would require follow-up by chest doctors, usually with bronchoscopy.

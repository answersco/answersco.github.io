title: "Bone scan with very abnormal huge uptake in chest region only could be due to? How to distinguish from wrong photo peak imaging?"

Due to recent I-131 therapy (if there's lung mets), will see lots of abnormal uptake in chest/lungs. You know it's not the wrong photo peak because it's only the upper half of the skeleton that is affected!

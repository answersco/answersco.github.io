title: "Why is Tc99mDTPA preferred over In-111 DTPA for CSF shunt study, but then In-111 DTPA preferred for CSF leak study?"

Has to do with their half lives

CSF shunt study is done in a few hours, so better to use Tc99m shorter 6 hour half life

But CSF leak study requires imaging at 24 hours or more and the 67-hour half life of Indium is thus preferred.

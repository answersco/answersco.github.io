title: "Ebbinghaus and the learning curve"
---
-looked at how long it takes to forget a memory
-hard to study so he studied himself
-memorized 100 nonsense words and then tested him at different intervals of time to see how much he remembered
-immediate recall: memorized all 100
-we have to forget and then relearn etc. to make it apart of long-term memory

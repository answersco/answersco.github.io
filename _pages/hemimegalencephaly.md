title: "Hemimegalencephaly"
---
Asymmetric hemispheric enlarged with polymicrogyric and pachygyric changes. May be associated with neurofibromatosis.

Large cerebral hemisphere with deviation of posterior falx and occipital pole to opposite side
Rarely affects ipsilateral cerebellum and brainstem
Thickened cortex with occasional calcification
Pachygyria, polygyria, fused gyri, and shallow sulci
Dysplastic cortex often hypointense on T2WI
Gray/white differentiation can be blurred
Large ipsilateral ventricle with abnormally shaped frontal horn
Developmental venous anomalies

-enlargement of all or part of one hemisphere
= big side + big ventricle

If big side has SMALL ventricle, then you need to be thinking about atrophy (like rasmussens encephalitis)

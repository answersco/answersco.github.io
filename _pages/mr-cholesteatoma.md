title: "MR cholesteatoma"

Cholesteatomas are of mixed intensity on T1-weighted pulse sequences and of high intensity on T2-weighted pulse sequences.
MRI is particularly useful for evaluating the extension of a cholesteatoma into the middle and/or posterior fossa, and for demonstrating possible herniation of intracranial contents into the temporal bone - especially after surgery.
After intravenous contrast MRI can distinguish granulation tissue from effusions.

Diffusion weighted MR can differentiate between a cholesteatoma, which has a restricted diffusion, and other abnormalities - especially granulation tissue - which have normal diffusion characteristics (figure).

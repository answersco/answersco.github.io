title: "Gate control theory"
---
-pain asserts that non-painful input closes the &quot;gates&quot; to painful input, which prevents pain sensation from traveling to the central nervous system
-dorsal horn cells act as a gate
-they close to prevent nociceptive impulses from reaching the brain (large diameter nerve fibers) 
-they open to allow impulses to be transmitted to the brain (small diameter nerve fibers)
-tactile stimulation pain relief: ex masotherapy 
-theory not fact but does work 
-rub the pain away

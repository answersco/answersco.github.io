Synovial cyst&#8594; epidural cyst associated with facet arthropathy
Hyperintense on T2-weighted images, variable signal intensity on T1-weighted images, depending on presence of internal hemorrhage.
MRI may or may not show continuity of the cyst with the facet joint
Epidural injection of the facet joint will show opacification of the cyst.
In contrast to a synovial cyst, a Tarlov cyst is not associated with facet arthropathy. It is a perineural cyst of the sacrum, and usually asymptomatic.

title: "XR: 1) (*)Hilgreiner's line thru triradiate cartilages &amp; Perkins line perpendicular to that at AIIS: femoral head should be in lower inner quadrant 2) Shenton's line from the medial obturator foramen tomedial femur should be continuous arc 3) teardrop distance &gt; 2mm: subluxation 4) lateral &amp; superior femoral head 5) delayed ossification femoral epiphysis 6) increased angulation acetabular roof US: 1) should not do in 1st 2 weeks b/c of physiologic laxity 2) Coronal view (better): similar to a frontal XR w/ iliac superior &amp; acetabulum posterior w/ gap in middle (triradiate cartilage) 3) Coronal: femoral head should be centered upon triradiate cartilage 4) Coronal: line drawn along the echogenic edge of the ilium should bisect femoral head. This line &amp; acetabular roof line for alpha angle (should be &gt;60) 5) Transverse: like axial CT showing the femoral head in the acetabulum (should be centered over traradiate cartilage gap 6) Flexion w/ adduction &amp; abduction done in transverse plane to look for hip dislocation or reduction. 7) Protocol: static coronal &amp; static, adduction &amp; abduction transverse Sx: F&gt;M, breech  Cz: 1) abnormal development &amp; configuration of acetabulum 2) increased ligamentous laxity around the hip Info: ossification normally starts at 2-3 months, hypothyroidism can delay  Tx: harness/brace to ensure acetabulum &amp; hip developcongruently so no perminent disability"

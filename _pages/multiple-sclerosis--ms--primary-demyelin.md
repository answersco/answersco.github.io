title: "Multiple sclerosis (MS, Primary Demyelination)"
---
Multiple CNS lesions separated in time and space. Typical lesions are high T2 signal and round or ovoid in a periventricular (perpendicular to ventricle) or subcortical location. Enhancement reflects new lesions. Dark T1 lesions are due to acutal neuronal tissue loss. Other sites affected: Cerebellar and cerebral peduncles. Corpus callosum. Medulla. Spinal cord. Conglomerate large lesions may be mistake for a neoplasm (tumefactive).

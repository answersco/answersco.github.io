title: "Inspection"
---
1) rate &amp; pattern of respiration
2) skin &amp; mucous membrane color
3) use of muscles/AP diameter (should be 1-2, if have COPD usually 1 to 1) 
4) position
5) clubbing of nails
6) cyanosis 
-central &amp; peripheral
-S/S of hypoxia

1) skin
-scars
-striae (stretch marks secondary to weight gain/loss, pregnancy, or ascites)
-rashes, lesion, or masses
2) contour:
-normal - slightly convex or flat
-obese - rounded, protuberant

3) muscle tone &amp; symmetry
4) umbilicus

-contour: innie or outie 
-location: pushed to side bc of underlying mass
5) visible peristalsis
6) pulsations
7) signs of pain (guarding)

1) skin color
2) pedal edema
3) observe for visible pulsations
-typically no cardiac pulsations are visible
-pulsation just below the sternum may indicate an abdominal aortic abnormality -- at risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm

1) shape/symmetry of the chest
2) splinting of chest wall can indicate trauma
3) retraction or bulging of intercostal spaces at ribs or clavicles (substernal retraction)
4) breathing rate
5) breathing rhythm (regular or irregular)
6) effort of breathing (use of accessory muscles)
7) oxygen supply
8) pt's position

-physical observations of the client
-general Survey: overall appearance of the client
-looking at rash or swollen joint
-first thing you always do

the idea of the Renaissance Era that refocused attention to the natural world; the idea that ethical and moral standards should be formulated and adhered to for life on earth not to accommodate the prescriptions of a deity and promises of a comfortable afterlife

The emphasis on the here-and-now rather than on the spiritual and otherworldly

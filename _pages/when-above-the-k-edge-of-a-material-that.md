title: "When above the K-edge of a material that is being imaged, increasing the tube voltage will have what effect on Compton scatter and photoelectric interactions?"
---
Both Compton and photoelectric interactions will decrease
Both Compton scatter and PLE are inversely proportional to the energy of the incident x-ray photons. Thus, when you increase tube voltage, you get less Compton interactions (1/E) and a lot less PLE (1/E3). This is why higher x-ray beams are more penetrating.

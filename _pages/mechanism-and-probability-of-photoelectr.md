Photoelectric Effect (PLE) (good) 
X-ray hits an inner shell electron &#8594; if energy great enough to overcome the k-shell binding, the inner shell electron will be ejected (photoelectron)
All or nothing reaction
Creates inner electron vacancy&#8594; downward cascade and release of characteristic x-ray OR production of an Auger electron
Since Auger electron production tends to dominate in tissues (unlike Tungsten) &#8594; some biologic damage
PLE contributes to image contrast (Compton only makes noise)

Probability of PLE:
Directly proportional to the atomic # Z3
Probability &#8593; with object density
Probability inversely proportional to the energy cubed

Chance of PLE sharply &#8593; when photon energy and electron binding energy are the same

title: "Asbestos exposure"

Asbestosis: refers to the changes of pulmonary fibrosis, not the actual exposure.
Appears similar to UIP, with parietal pleural thickening representing the best way to distinguish from IPF.
20 year latency between initial exposure and development of lung cancer or mesothelioma.
Association with extrathoracic cancer: peritoneal mesothelioma, GI cancer, renal cancer, laryngeal cancer, and leukemia.
Benign pleural effusion: earliest pleural based phenomenon, about 5 years after expsoure.

Pleural plaques develop ~20-30 years, with calcifications around 40 years
Plaques tend to spare the apices and costophrenic angles
Round atelectasis commonly associated

Malignant mesothelioma: lag time ~30-40 years
&quot;Pleural rind&quot;
Tendency for direct invasion
Extension into fissure highly suggestive.

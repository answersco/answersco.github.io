title: "What is isomeric transition?"
---
After isobaric transition (e.g. Beta plus, Beta minus, electron capture), the left over energy is emitted to drop the nuclide into its ground state.
- i.e. same mass number and atomic number after the transition

- mostly emitted in the form of gamma radiation

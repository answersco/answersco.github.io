title: "T1 is due to giving energy back to lattice. So what affects T2?"
---
Small magnetic field inhomogeneities (due to magnetic noise), e.g. fluctuations of the local magnetic field due to random movement of charged particles.
*If the charged particles can move around well, e.g. in water, it's hard to get them to &quot;settle down&quot; and promote T2 relaxation --&gt; thus long T2.

However, if you add protein to the water, the movement of the charged particles is slowed so you get lower frequency magnetic noise and they settle down more quickly.

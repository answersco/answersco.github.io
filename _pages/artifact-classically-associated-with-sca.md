Photon Starvation: 
High-attenuating areas (classically the shoulders) &#8594; can result in photon starvation &#8594; manifests as streaking
Seen when the beam travels horizontally through the area of greatest attenuation

Fixing photon starvation:
Automated tube current modulation&#8594; increases the dose through the area of greater attenuation
Adaptive filtration&#8594; corrects the attenuation profile by &quot;smoothing&quot; the data in the high attenuation portions.

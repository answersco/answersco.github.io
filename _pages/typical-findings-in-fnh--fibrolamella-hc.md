title: "Typical findings in FNH, fibrolamella HCC, and hepatic adenoma:"
---
FNH: usually homogeneously hypervascular on arterial phase and nearly isodense to liver on other phases, with a delayed-enhancing central scar.
Central scar bright on T2WI; shows delayed persistent enhancement on CT and MR.
Fibrolamellar HCC: over 60% have a large central scar with calcification. The tumors are large at presentation, and show much more heterogeneous enhancement than FNH. At presentation, they usually have lymphatic or other metastases, with peak age of 23 years.
Hepatic adenoma: usually heterogeneously hypervascular, often with foci of fat, necrosis, and/or hemorrhage.

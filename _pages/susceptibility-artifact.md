title: "Susceptibility artifact"
---
This is when another substance becomes magnetized (traditionally seen with meta)
This is going to be least noticeable on FSE or spin echo sequences because of the 180 degree refocusing pulse
Also this is going to be better on STIR images than frequency selected fat supression
This is also going to be better on OUT OF PHASE imaginng relative to IN PHASE imaging (this is because IN PHASE imaging is normally done second and therefore more time has passed which means more DEPHASING)

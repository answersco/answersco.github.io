title: "Use of segmental limb pressures in PAD"
---
Segmental limb pressures are frequently combined with Doppler waveform analysis at each level
Enhances the utility of the study by providing an assessment of flow in addition to pressure
Changes in the shape and amplitude of the waveform reflect increasing severity of disease, becoming biphasic or even flat.

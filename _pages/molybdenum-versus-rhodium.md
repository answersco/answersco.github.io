title: "Molybdenum versus Rhodium"
---
Molybdenum: low kVp and low Z&#8594; gives Moly high characteristic x-ray production and low Bremsstrahlung.
Z = 42 K-edge = 20.0 keV Characteristic x-rays&#8594; 17.9 and 19.5 keV
K-edge filter: placed on outside of tube with goal of creating a nearly mono-energetic beam in target range of 16-23 keV.

Rhodium: better for thicker/denser breasts than Mo due to higher energy spectrum (Rh/Rh)
Z = 45 K-edge = 23.2 keV Char. x-rays = 20.2 and 22.7 (more penetrating)

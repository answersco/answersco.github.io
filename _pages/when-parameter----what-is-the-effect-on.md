title: "When parameter &#8593;, what is the effect on spatial resolution (SR), SNR, and acquisition time: FOV, slice thickness, image matrix."
---
&#8593; FOV &#8594; &#8595; SR, &#8593; SNR, no change of acquisition time.
&#8593; slice thickness &#8594; &#8595; SR, &#8593; SNR, no change of acquisition time.
&#8593; image matrix &#8594; &#8593; SR, &#8595; SNR, &#8593; acquisition time.

&#8593; signal averages &#8594; no change SR, &#8593; SNR, &#8593; acquisition time (SNR &#8593; as the square root of the # of excitations)
&#8593; receiver bandwidth&#8594; no change SR, &#8595; SNR, and &#8595; acquisition time.
&#8593; field strength&#8594; no change SR, &#8593; SNR, no change of acquisition time.
&#8593; partial k-space sampling&#8594; no change SR, &#8595; SNR, &#8595; acquisition time.

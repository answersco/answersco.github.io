title: "Hawthorne effect"
---
The simple awareness by workers that they are being observed changes behavior and increases productivity.

Hawthorne effect (AKA the observer effect): has been observed in medicine and radiology.
A QI project may have an initial rise in the undesired measures (e.g. patient falls), where the increase is attributable to the Hawthorne effect. 
Results in a characteristic &quot;QI curve&quot; &#8594; incidence of the undesired event plotted versus time initially rises, then reaches a plateau, and then falls as a result of the improvement intervention.
Hawthorne effect was implicated in explaining shortened fluoroscopic times under observation/monitoring.

People behave differently when they think they're being watched

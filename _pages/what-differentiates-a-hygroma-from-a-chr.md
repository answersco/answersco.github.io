title: "What differentiates a hygroma from a chronic subdural, from a enlarged subarachnoid space, and from subdural effusion?"
---
Hygroma is due to a tear in the arachnoid and is usually post traumatic or post surgical.
Chronic Subacute hematoma is post hemorrhagic and more common.
Look for the inward displacement of the subarachnoid bridging veins which differentiate this from a subarachnoid collection (which is seen in infancy or with pronounced volume loss.)
Subdural effsuion is post meningitis with plasma and not CSF.

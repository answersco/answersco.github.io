Acute mesenteric ischemia: 
SMA embolism distal to the middle colic artery carries highest risk of intestinal ischemia, as there are few native distal collaterals.
Middle colic artery anastomoses with the IMA via the marginal artery of Drummond and the arc of Riolan.
In select patients with acute embolic mesenteric ischemia without peritoneal signs or clinical findings suggestive of bowel necrosis, endovascular therapy with thrombolysis or suction embolectomy may be performed.
Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI, AKA intestinal necrosis with a patent arterial tree): highly lethal form of acute mesenteric ischemia
Features spasm and narrowing of multiple branches of the mesenteric arteries
Primary treatment: direct arterial infusion of the vasodilator papaverine (30-60 mg/h)
Chronic mesenteric ischemia: 
Angiography shows ostial narrowing of the mesenteric vessels, often with post-stenotic dilatation.
Because of extensive mesenteric collaterals, at least 2 of 3 mesenteric arteries (celiac, SMA, IMA) must be diseased to produce symptoms.

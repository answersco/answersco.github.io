title: "Odds ratio and relative risk"
---
Odds ratio (OR): odds of a disease in the exposed (or test positive) group divided by the odds of disease in the unexposed (or test negative) group
OR = (TP x TN) / (FN x TN)

Relative risk (RR): the probability of disease in the exposed group divided by the probability of disease in the unexposed group
For rare diseases, the OR is a close approximation of the RR

Bilateral: think Potter sequence
Unilateral (usually sporadic):
Women: 70% with genital anomalies, usually unicornuate uterus
Men: 20% with absent ipsilateral epididymis and vas deferens or ipsilateral seminal vesicle cyst.
Both may also have absent ipsilateral ureter or hemitrigone.

Potter sequence: insult (maybe ACE-inhibitors) &#8594; kidneys don't form&#8594; pulmonary hypoplasia.
Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser: Mullerian duct anomalies including absence or atresia of uterus. Associated with ipsilateral renal agenesis.
Lying-down adrenal or &quot;pancake&quot; adrenal sign: describes the elongated appearance of the adrenal not normally molded by the adjacent kidney.

title: "How can intraventricular meningioma be distinguished from other intraventricular masses?"
---
Low SI on T2 and intense Gd enhancement favor meningioma.
Unlike meningioma of the falx, intraventricular meningioma will not have dural tail.

Choroid plexus pap/carc, ependymoma, and intraventricular mets will be intensely bright on T2, and also have Gd enhancement.
Xanthogranuloma cyst of choroid plexus does not enhance but is DWI +.

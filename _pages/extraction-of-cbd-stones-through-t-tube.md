title: "Extraction of CBD stones through T-tube tract: procedure"
---
-T-tube removed over guidewire and access to duodenum achieved using a combination of a hydrophilic wire and Kumpe catheter.
-Superstiff wire placed in duodenum and left as a safety-wire.
-A steerable catheter (Burhenne) is placed in the bile duct through the T-tube tract. The handle of the Burhenne is used to deflect the tip of the catheter so that the catheter can be manipulated either up or down the bile duct, depending on where the stone is located.
-The Burhenne catheter is placed a little distal to the stone and a basket placed through the catheter. The basket is opened distal to the stone, and the catheter and basket are slowly withdrawn until the stone is reached.
-The catheter and basket are jiggled so that stone falls within basket. The basket is then pulled back against the end of the Burhenne catheter to grip the stone, and the catheter and basket are removed as a unit.
-If the stone is too large to be removed from the tract, the stone can be fragmented by electrohydraulic, laser, or mechanical lithotripsy.
-After the procedure, if significant edema is present at the ampulla, a 12-Fr catheter is left in the duodenum for 2-3 days. No catheter is left for an atraumatic procedure.

title: "Diagnosis of alzheimer's"
---
1) detailed pt history

2) information from family and friends

3) laboratory and diagnostic tests like:
-rule out vit B12 and folate deficiency
-rule out hypothyroidism with TFT tests
-blood cell count, serum electrolyte, and LFT
-CT, PET, or MRI scans may aid in diagnosis

**Important to look at all aspects before diagnosing because other things mimic this but are reversible

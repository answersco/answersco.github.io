title: "Fluoro technique vs XR: mA, kVp, exposure time, focal spot"
---
mA: 0-5 (versus 200-800 in regular XR)
kVp: 50-120 (same as XR)
Exposure times: much longer than in XR
Focal spot: 0.3-0.6 (1-1.2 XR) in order to limit geometrical blurring
Larger focal spot used for the spot image (same as conventional XR) because greater tube current is needed. '
Fluoro frame shot has more quantum mottle than spot image (fewer photons)
Grid used (same as regular x-ray, ~10:1)

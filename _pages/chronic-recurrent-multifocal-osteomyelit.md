title: "Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO)"
---
Nonpyogenic inflammatory disorder that tends to occur in lower extremity long bones, and can mimic osteomyelitis. It is typically a self-limited diagnosis.
Associated with SAPHO syndrome: synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis.
Key imaging finding: migratory lytic and sclerotic lesions separated in time in space. 
CRMO can be indistinguishable from pyogenic OM on XR and MRI, but CRMO doesn't feature soft tissue abscess, bony sequestra, or fistula.

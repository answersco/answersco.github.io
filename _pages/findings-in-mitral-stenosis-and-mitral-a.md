Mitral stenosis: 
Appears as a normal-sized heart with LA enlargement.
Pulmonary venous pressures are typically &#8593;.

Mitral annular calcification (MAC): degenerative process 
May be associated with &#8593; risk of stroke, adverse CV events, and Afib.
Can be associated with mitral regurgitation, but not associated with mitral stenosis (where there may be mitral VALVE calcification).

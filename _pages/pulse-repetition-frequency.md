title: "Pulse repetition frequency"
---
Basically think about this as how frequently the probe is sending out pulses versus how often it is LISTENING for returning pulses
You want the probe to be LISTENING A LOT if you are trying to detect slow flow
You want the probe to be PULSING a lot if you are looking for HIGH flows

If you have a LOW PRF and you encounter HIGH flows, you will alias and you will get ambiguity in the signal (it's too much similar information - too much listening)

If you have a HIGH PRF , you will be able to detect HIGH flows and you will not see the low flows (the low flow will not cause enough doppler shift)

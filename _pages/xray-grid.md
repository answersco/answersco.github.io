title: "XRAY Grid"
---
This blocks all of the XRAYS that are NOT traveling within a straight line (which ultimately give you scatter/noise)
This is almost equivalent to a collimator in nuclear radiology imaging
Grid ratio = density of the grid. As grid ratio goes UP (density goes up), there is LESS scatter and BETTER contrast
HOWEVER, the delivered dose will INCREASE with a grid
Because you are having fewer photons contact the receptor, the brightness control (which is related to the mAs) INCREASES to compensate 

Important points:

When you use a grid vs. no grid, you INCREASE dose
When you use a grid with a higher grid ratio, you INCREASE dose

Respiratory bronchiolitis-interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD)
Respiratory bronchiolitis is very common in smokers, where pigmented macrophages are found in respiratory bronchioles. RB is usually asymptomatic, but if symptoms are present (usually cough and SOB), the clinical syndrome is called RB-ILD.
Key imaging features of RB-ILD: centrilobular nodules and patchy ground-glass opacities.
In contrast to NSIP, the distribution of GGO in RB-ILD is more random than the peripherally predominant pattern of NSIP.

Respiratory bronchiolitis (thought that desquamative interstitial pneumonia is same process just on the far end of the bad spectrum)
Findings = centrilobular pulmonary nodules (ground glass) in an apical distribution
This is a SMOKING related lung disease (as is desquamative IP)

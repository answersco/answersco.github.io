drunk driving case illustrating depraved indifference to human life; speeding, driving in different lanes, extremely reckless conduct; can determine defendant acted w/ &quot;malice aforethought&quot; as a result of his recklessness-plus

POW case reflecting the harsh common-law imminence standard for duress; can't use duress defense until brought to the last ditch; you basically have to start walking, show that danger of death was imminent from marching north

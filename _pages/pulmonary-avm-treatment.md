Pulmonary AVM: abnormal connection between pulmonary artery (PA) and pulmonary veins (PV) &#8594; right-to-left shunt
Multiple pulmonary AVMs: 
Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome
Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) &#8594; can present clinically with brain abscess, stroke, or recurrent epistaxis (due to nasal mucosal telangiectasia)
Treatment:
Coils must be used for pulmonary AVM. Particles are contraindicated as the right-to-left shunt would cause brain emboli and infarction.
Most pulmonary AVMs have a single feeding artery&#8594; coiling of this inflow artery (via PA approach) is usually sufficient for treatment.
Treatment of peripheral (e.g. extremity) AVM generally requires elimination of the entire nidus, which is often fed from multiple arterial branches.
Asymptomatic lesion with feeding artery size &gt; 3 mm or a symptomatic lesion (i.e. prior infarct or brain abscess) is an indication for treatment.

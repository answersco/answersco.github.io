title: "Focal zone, and the effect of multiple focal zones"
---
Focal Zone: narrowest portion of the beam &#8594; point of maximum intensity and lateral resolution.

Multiple focal zones: by repeatedly acquiring data over the same volume, but with changes in the phase timing of the array elements
Each focal zone requires an independent set of pulses &#8594; increasing the # of focal zones decreases frame rate and temporal resolution

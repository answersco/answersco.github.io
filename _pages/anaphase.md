title: "Anaphase"
---
-centromeres divide
-chromatids separate and become independent chromosomes
-the newly independent chromosomes move to opposite ends of the cell

-centromeres divide in two
-spindle fibers pull sister chromatids to opposite poles of cell
-each pole (future daughter cell) now has an identical set of genes
-cleavage furrow forms after this stage

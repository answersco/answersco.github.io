In eukaryotes, mRNA transcripts are modified before they leave the nucleus

Several steps process pre-mRNA into mature mRNA:
1) A methylated cap is added to the 5' end
- Recognition site for protein synthesis
2) A poly-A tail is added to the 3' end
- Stabilizes the mRNA
3) Splicing occurs
- Introns (&quot;intervening sequences&quot;) are removed
- Exons (&quot;expressed sequences&quot;) are spliced together
- Note that introns may outnumber and outsize exons

Finally, the mature mRNA is sent out of the nucleus

Pre-mRNA have introns present unlike mature mRNA

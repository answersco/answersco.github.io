title: "Disadvantages of source-oriented records"
---
-requires time 
-may be hard to read
-may lack information concerning client outcomes
-quality assurance monitoring more difficult
-relevant data found in several places
-confidentiality is difficult to protect
-the big disadvantage is that it takes time and in some cases are difficult to read
-the data is often fragmented, making it difficult to track problems chronologically with input from different groups of professionals
-also, anyone can pick up the chart and read it -- there is no checking on who reads the chart so confidentiality is shaky

Factors Affecting SAR
SAR &#8593; with the square of the magnetic field strength
SAR limits can be easily surpassed with high field (&gt; 3T) system
SAR &#8593; with the square of the flip angle
Fast sequences typically use a low flip angle (10-40&#176;), but TR is also usually low &#8594; energy deposition as a function of time may still be high.
SAR &#8595; with &#8593; (lengthened) TR &#8594; this &#8593; the overall time in which energy is deposited, thus &#8595; deposited power
SAR &#8593; with the # of RF pulses per cycle (TR), for example, in high echo train length spin echo sequences.
SAR &#8593; with &#8593; patient size in order to deposit signal throughout a larger interrogated volume.

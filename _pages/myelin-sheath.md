title: "Myelin Sheath"
---
-lipid cells that surround the axon to increase speed and efficiency of impulse
-protects electrical signal from going from one axon to another
-no energy is lost which helps to increase speed
EX. Jalapeno: myelin sheath not protecting axon so the signal takes longer

-glial cells form electrical insulation
-allows signal to move faster and not dissipate or move to another cell

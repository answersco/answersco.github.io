title: "Hypocalcemia"
---
-net loss of Ca+ from extracellular fluid in greater quantities than can be replaced by intestines or bone.
-causes increased contractility and nerves
-vitamin D takes up calcium and helps the absorption of calcium
-Chvosteks Sign: tapping on facial nerve just anterior to the ear produces tetany (involuntary twitching on the ipsilateral (same) side of the patients face/upper lip.
-Trousseau Sign: inflate a BP cuff above NSBP range. Positive response in a patient with hypocalcemia is a wrist, metacarpal and phalangeal/thumb flexion.

-deficient in blood calcium levels
-changes in membrance potentials specifically nervous system is overly excitable
-causes tetany which is muscle spasms from the overly excitable nerves and when it gets super bad causes larnyospasms which is suffocation

title: "IMPORTANT EQUATION: How do you calculate the near field in ultrasound?"

Element^2 / Wavelength

* Wavelength is in the denominator! Thus, with an increased probe frequency, you get decreased wavelength, which INCREASES your NEAR FIELD.

* Good because Near field is where imaging is performed and a longer one can improve the quality and efficiency of imaging

Spatial resolution = (1 / 2*FWHM)

Ex) If FWHM is 0.2 mm, then spatial resolution = (1 / 2*.2) = (1/.4) = 2.5 lp/mm

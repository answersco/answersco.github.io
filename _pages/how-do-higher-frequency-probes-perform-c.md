title: "How do higher frequency probes perform compared to lower frequency probes?"
---
Higher frequency probes have better axial resolution but poor penetration, while lower frequency probes have poor axial resolution but better penetration.

Axial resolution = spatial pulse length / 2 &#8594; as spatial pulse length &#8595;, axial resolution improves.
Since pulse lengths are fairly constant at 2-3 wavelengths, the most obvious way to shorten the spatial pulse length is to shorten the wavelength (i.e. &#8593; the pulse frequency). By &#8593; the pulse frequency, you &#8595; the spatial pulse length and &#8593; axial resolution.

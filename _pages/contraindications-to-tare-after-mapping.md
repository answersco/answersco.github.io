Contraindications to TARE after mapping:
-Pulmonary shunt fraction that would result in dose of &gt; or equal to 30 Gy in single treatment (50 Gy cumulative) = results in risk of XRT pneumonitis.
-Uncorrectable vascular anatomy that would allow nontarget organ exposure and thus risk of GI ulceration.

title: "Diagnostic films imaged with 20-40 keV x-rays result in high-contrast images of bone. This is due mainly to what photon interaction?"
---
Photoelectric effect.
Photoelectric effect cross-section increases dramatically for lower-energy x-rays.
Compton effect becomes important only at energies &gt; 50 keV.
Pair production and photo-nuclear interactions only occur at &gt; 1.02 MeV.

title: "Advantages of cryoablation"
---
Cryo offers many of the minimally invasive advantages of RFA.
Advantages over RFA include decreased procedure-related pain in some applications and improved real-time visualization of the treated area.
Generally, the attainable zone of ablation is largest with cryo for comparable length of treatment given the routine placement of multiple simultaneous applicators. However the time spent placing multiple applicators may be similar to that for repositioning RFA electrodes for overlapping ablations.

Hepatic adenoma: benign neoplasm containing hepatocytes, scattered Kupffer cells, and no bile ducts
Absence of bile ducts renders HIDA a useful test to distinguish between FNH (contains bile ducts, and should be + on HIDA) and adenoma (no bile ducts, HIDA negative).
F&gt;&gt;&gt;M, especially with prolonged OCP use, or anabolic steroids for male patient
Relatively high risk of hemorrhage&#8594; incidental lesions usually resected
Multiple hepatic adenomas seen in von Gierke disease (type 1 glycogen storage disease)
May have pseudocapsule, which tends to enhance late
Adenomas lack PV drainage&#8594; hypervascular on arterial phase images
Microscopic fat (when present): best seen on in- and out-of-phase MRI
Intralesional hemorrhage&#8594; may cause T1 hyperintensity
Adenomas may be difficult to differentiate from other hypervascular lesions in the absence of fat or hemorrhage.

Benign hepatic neoplasm containing hepatocytes, scattered Kupffer cells and NO bile ducts.

Gallium-67
Cyclotron-produced
Decays by electron capture&#8594; emits multiple gamma rays
93, 184, 296, and 388 keV (easier to remember as 90, 190, 290, and 390 keV)
T1/2 = 78 hours
Binds to transferrin&#8594; found in infection, inflammation, and neoplasm
Normal distribution: high activity in bowel and colon, and less in liver, skull, bone marrow, and salivary glands
Use in the abdomen is limited due to high bowel and liver activity
Persistent gallium in the kidneys is never normal after 24 hours and signifies renal disease.
Diffuse pulmonary uptake is also abnormal, with a wide differential of infectious and inflammatory conditions (PCP PNA, IPF, sarcoidosis, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, miliary TB, and fungal infection).
Gallium scans have been largely replaced by PET-CT
Evaluation of spinal osteomyelitis remains a first-line application

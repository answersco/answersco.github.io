1) fill with warm water and fill to prescribed level
2) sometimes a soap suds enema to make it slippery and reduce surface tension and irritating to the mucosa to stimulate it to move
3) insert 2-3 inches into rectum then open clamp
4) tell pt to hold the fluid
5) can lower the bag to make fluid go slower or clamp it
6) deep breathes or panting to help relax until spasm has passed then keep going
7) the more volume you get in, the more likely it will be effective

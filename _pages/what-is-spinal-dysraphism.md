title: "What is spinal dysraphism?"
---
A spectrum of disease from spina bifida occulta (benign bony defect) to open neural tube defect. Cutaneous manifestations at the lumbosacral spine may indicate the presence of an occult dysraphism. These are associated with folic acid deficiency during fetal development and with anorectal and geniturinary malformations (especially tethered cord)

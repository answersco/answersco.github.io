title: "Pulsed fluoro vs regular fluoro"
---
Basically, regular has a constant low mA (higher s)
Pulsed fluoro has short bursts of high mA 

IF the frame rate is 30/s then there is NO DIFFERENCE in dose 

Benefits of pulse fluoro:

- Good for moving patients because it gives less motion blur
- Pulse fluoro CAN reduce dose when the pulse rate is LOW than 30/s. 50% reduction in pulse rate = 30% reduction in dose

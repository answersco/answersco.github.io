title: "Metabolism"
---
-also called biotransformation
-drugs can be metabolized in both the GI tract and the liver
-the liver is the primary site of metabolism
-drugs are altered by enzyme activity to: become active, form active metabolites, become inactive, and become water soluble for easier excretion
-liver disease such as cirrhosis or hepatitis will decrease metabolic processes - takes longer to metabolize drugs so medications can build up quickly in their system
-metabolic pathways can be &quot;overloaded&quot; by particular drugs (for example: acetaminophen)

-includes anabolism and catabolism
-all reaction require enzymes bc they are catalysts which help speed up the processes

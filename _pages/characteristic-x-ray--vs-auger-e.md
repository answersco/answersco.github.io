title: "Characteristic X-ray (vs Auger e-)"
---
When a vacancy in an inner shell is created (by incoming e- or photon), an outer shell e- promptly fills the vacancy. The energy may appear as an x-ray (or Auger e-). If the energy is emitted as an x-rays it carries an exact and discrete energy and are called characteristic x-rays equal to the difference in binding energies.

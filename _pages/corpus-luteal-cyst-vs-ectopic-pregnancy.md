title: "Corpus luteal cyst vs Ectopic pregnancy"
---
REMEMBER: corpus luteal cyst will move WITH the ovary (this makes sense because the vast majority of ectopic pregnancies are EXTRAovarian).
REMEMBER: Ectopic pregnancy can be PUSHED AWAY from the ovary (this also makes sense because the majority of these things are TUBAL in location)

title: "Translation"
---
post-transcriptional modification affected by protein folding, polypeptides shortening, sugar and lipids added, and polypeptides aggregate

-production of protein using mRNA as a template
-process of reading the mRNA base sequence to assemble an amino acid chain (protein)
-occurs on ribosomes in the cytoplasm
-requires mRNA, tRNAs with amino acids, ribosomes, energy molecules (ATP, GTP) and protein factors
-divided into three steps: initiation, elongation, and termination

RNA --&gt; Protein

-mRNA leaves nucleus and begins process through ribosomes
-anticodons of mRNA bind to codons of tRNA
-the ribosome grabs tRNA to see of it fits in any codons (occurs in cytoplasm)

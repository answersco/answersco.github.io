title: "Portal to portal collateral pathways"
---
Portal-to-portal collaterals become apparent when focal occlusions develop within the portal circulation.

Splenic vein occlusion: retrograde flow can occur through the short gastric veins to the left gastric vein.

Occlusion of central SMV: can result in collateral drainage through mesenteric, paraduodenal, and marginal veins.
-Collateral pathways for splenic vein and SMV occlusion are frequently submucosal and thus prone to bleeding in GI tract.

Portal vein occlusion: results in enlargement of the pericholedochal and epicholedochal veins in the gastrohepatic ligament (termed cavernous transformation).
-A small, residual, or recanalized MPV may exist within this network but can be difficult to identify.

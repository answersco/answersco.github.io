-environmental factors contribute to cancer by mutating or altering the expression of genes that control the cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair
-inheriting a susceptibility gene places a person farther along the road to cancer - does not mean you will get cancer but means you are at increased chance (however, cancer can happen in somatic cells in anyone)
-interactions between genes and the environment exist --

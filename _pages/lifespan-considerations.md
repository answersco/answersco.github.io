title: "Lifespan considerations"

1) Infants: lack object permeance until about 4-7 months old
2) Toddler/Preschooler: are into magical thinking and so they may think death is reversible, may think they did something to cause the loss because their life experience is limited
3) School Age/Adolescent: usually when people experience death for the first time, understand it is permanent, internalize and figure it out for themselves
4) Adult/Older Adult: experience more losses but not necessarily death, have experienced grief in certain circumstances
-older adults have different perspective - have shrinking support system from death of loved ones, losing independence with living, driving, or finances

1) newborn/infant - under treatment of pain
2) toddler/preschooler- cannot ID pain
3) school age/adolescent- can rationalize pain
4) adult/older adult- MS (musculoskeletal) pain
-start low and slow for elders bc it can cause confusion and sedation
5) cultural- communication /devalued

1) newborn and infant: immunity fully functional at 6 months
2) toddler and pre-schooler: needs supervision, handwashing, good toileting skills, eating well
3) child and adolescent- skin disease, lice, staph infections
4) adult and older adult: nutrition, immunity established, chronic disease, HAI, bed bugs

1) younger people may be independent with self-care
2) older adult
-skin less elastic, thinner so it is more prone to injury (temperature too hot or rubbing too vigorously)
-hair is thinner
-dentures, hearing aides, glasses, and other assistive devices
-may be HOH (hard of hearing)

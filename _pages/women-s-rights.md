title: "Women's rights"
---
post WWII women are now, more than ever, seen as an integral part to European society. Since they already have the right to vote in most nations women start to push for cheaper birth control, equal pay, equal work benefits, equal representation in politics. EWL (European Women's Lobby) started in 1990 and is the largest women's rights group in Europe. Once women start to gain more rights in the late 1980s, the LGBT movement starts to gain momentum for equal rights as well.

No single accepted criterion.
Common historical criterion is absolute increase in serum creatinine from baseline of at least 0.5 mg/dl, but other definitions require increase of up to 2 mg/dl.
Another approach is defined as 25-50% increase in baseline serum creatinine.
Typical clinical course is a rise in serum creatinine within 24 hours of CM, which peaks at about 4 days, and returns to baseline within 7-10 days, usually without permanent renal dysfunction.
Risk factors include serum Cr of 2.0 mg/dl in patients with CKD; AKI; DM; dehydration; cardiovascular disease; diuretic use; advanced age, multiple myeloma; HTN; hyperuricemia; and multiple administrations of CM within 24 hours.

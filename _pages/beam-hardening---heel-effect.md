title: "Beam hardening = heel effect"
---
Attenuation also occurs in the anode of the x-ray tube. Because the target is angled, there is a difference in the intensity of the beam exiting the target. The result is greater attenuation and beam hardening in the direction towards the anode, known as the heel effect. Compensation for the heel effect can be made by placing denser portions of the body on the cathode side and thinner portions of the body on the anode side of the tube, as is commonly done with upright chest x-ray imaging.

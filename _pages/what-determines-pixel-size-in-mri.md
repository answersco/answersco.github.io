title: "What determines pixel size in MRI?"
---
Pixel size&#8594; corresponds to in-plane resolution
Pixel size = FOV / matrix size
Pixel size (In-plane resolution)&#8594; inversely proportional to the product of the gradient amplitude and duration.
The more intense (higher amplitude) a gradient or the longer a gradient is applied (&#8593; product) &#8594; the smaller the pixel size and the better the spatial resolution.
As with matrix size and FOV, the pixel size can be different along the 2 axes &#8594; thus, the pixel size along the readout axis will be controlled by the product of the readout gradient amplitude and duration.

Hemangioblastoma = avidly enhancing mass on pial surface of spinal cord associated with enlarged feeding vessels and flow voids

Ependymoma = Circumscribed, with symmetric CORD EXPANSION, Cysts, and old hemorrhage. Little edema with variable enhancement 
* HETEROGENEOUS enhancement
- arise from central canal
- LONG SEGMENT
- HEMORRHAGIC CAP T2 DARK

Astrocytoma = Kids; SHORT SEGMENT; T1 Dark, T2 Bright, Enhance HOMOGENEOUSLY, ECCENTRIC with more indistinct margins

title: "Ion chamber"

USED for calculating rate of dosage delivered (typical range 30 microCi to 2 Ci)
Dose should be within 5% of the computed activity and this should be checked DAILY
Measuring HIGHER dose of radiations 
Lower sensitivity 
Stable across a wide voltage range - excellent for accurate estimates
Can detect exposure rates 0.1 to 100 R/h

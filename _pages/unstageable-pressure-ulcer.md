title: "Unstageable pressure ulcer"
---
-full-thickness loss covered by slough or eschar
-difference between unstageable and stage 3 or 4 is that we cannot see the bottom bc it is covered in slough or eschar

-full-thickness tissue loss
-wound covered by slough(slimy brown/tan and stuck to the wound) or eschar (black piece of dead tissue that scabbed or crusted but adhered or stuck to the wound)
-must be debrided to remove slough or eschar before it can be staged
-because it has slough or eschar does not make it unstageable, what makes it unstageable bc the underlying tissue is unable to be seen
-almost always stage 3 or 4 so treatment is same as a stage 3/4

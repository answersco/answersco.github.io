title: "Peritubular capillaries"
---
-reabsorb water and solutes that leave the basal surface of the tubular epithelium 
-reabsorption occurs by osmosis and solvent drag
-three factors promote osmosis into the capillaries:
1) High interstitial fluid pressure 
2) Low blood hydrostatic pressure in peritubular capillaries 
3) High colloid osmotic pressure in blood

Silver (can be used as a filter for tungsten target, as can Rh):
K = 47 K-edge = 25.5 keV 
Highest effective energy beam and &#8593; heating capacity &#8594; allowing shorter exposure times, increased penetration, and lower dose.
Contrast is lost, but can be accommodated by post-processing.

Mo anode with Rhodium filter&#8594; used for intermediate energy spectrum between Mo/Mo and Rh/Rh

Never use Rh target (21 keV) with Mo filter (20 keV k-edge)

Mo anode can be combined with aluminum filter&#8594; harder beam to penetrate denser breasts.

title: "Where are ganglion cysts most commonly located in the wrist? What is the typical enhancement pattern?"
---
Location: In the volar radial aspect of the wrist adjacent to the radiocarpal joint.

Ganglion cysts are frequently septated. Enhancement will occur in the capsule and septations. Depending on imaging timing after contrast, diffusion of Gad within a cyst may may produce homogeneous enhancement on delayed images.

Solid enhancement and heterogeneous enhancement of soft tissue masses are worrisome for mass lesions like synovial sarcoma or nerve sheath tumors.

StatDx:
Adjacent to joint or tendon sheath
Dorsal or volar to wrist
Smooth, well-defined margin; round, oblong, or teardrop-shaped
Often multilocular
Often see narrow neck extending to joint
Homogeneous low signal intensity on T1WI
High signal intensity on T2WI, STIR, &#177; signal heterogeneity
Rim enhancement with gadolinium administration

Tx: US-guided aspiration

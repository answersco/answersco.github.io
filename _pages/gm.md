More sensitive. Causes avalanche of ionizations so not accurate. Also down time during spread of ionization wi chamber. Voltage is applied to two plates across the gas chamber and as ion pairs are produced they are pulled apart and to plates and turned to electric charge- carried to sound. ---to differentiate types you can turn GM over so aluminum side rather than thin detector side is facing source. Alpha and some beta will not penetrate- high E gamma will.

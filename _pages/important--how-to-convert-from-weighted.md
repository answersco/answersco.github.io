title: "IMPORTANT: How to convert from Weighted CTDI to CTDI vol, then to DLP?"
---
1. Weighted CTDI = 1/3 central CTDI + 2/3 Peripheral CTDI (dose = mGy)
2. CTDI vol = Weighted CTDI/pitch 
3. DLP = CTDI vol * Length of scan (in mGy-cm)
4. Effective dose = k * DLP (k is the body part constant) (units Sv)

title: "Appearance and treatment of aortic coarctation"

Coarctation of thoracic Ao: congenital fibrous narrowing of distal arch, or more commonly proximal descending thoracic Ao distal to left subclavian artery.
-Hemodynamically significant lesions present with UE HTN with decreased LE pressures, dissection, LV hypertrophy or dysfunction.
-Hypertrophy of collaterals is a hallmark of severe stenosis.

Pseudocoarctation:
-In older, hypertensive adults, the descending thoracic Ao may become elongated and tortuous, simulating a congenital coarctation.
-The absence of significant pressure gradient (&lt;20 mmHg) distinguishes this as pseudocoarctation.

Treatment: surgical preferred for kids &lt;5
Angioplasty alone has high rate of restenosis
Stent placement results approach those of surgical repair, with balloon-expandable stents offering advantage of later dilation as patient grows.

title: "In US imaging, the half-value thickness (HVT) in soft tissue is the thickness of tissue necessary to attenuate signal intensity by how many decibels?"
---
3 dB
HVT is defined as the tissue thickness that reduces the intensity of the US beam by 50%. Using the logarithmic relationship for attenuation, the decibel reduction is equal to 3 dB.

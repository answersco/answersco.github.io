title: "Classic BT shunt versus modified BTS"
---
Classic BTS: originally developed for TOF
Shunt created between subclavian artery and pulmonary artery
Constructed on opposite side of the arch.
Technically difficult.
Often distorts anatomy of the PA

Modified BTS: gortex shunt between the subclavian artery and PA
Same side as the arch
Easier procedure

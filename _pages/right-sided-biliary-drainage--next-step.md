title: "Right-sided biliary drainage: next step after 5-French sheath"
---
Once good purchase is obtained, the 4-Fr inner plastic cannula and 0.018 guidewire are removed
-A 0.035 or 0.038 in J-guidewire is placed through the 5-Fr sheath into the biliary tree.
-The 5-Fr sheath is removed
-A hockey-stick type catheter is placed over the J-wire
-J-wire exchanged for a 0.035 in hydrophilic guidewire with a straight tip
-The hockey-stick catheter and glidewire are manipulated down to a level just above the stricture.
-Glidewire is removed and contrast is injected, often showing a small nipple of compressed duct above the stricture.
-Stricture is probed with the hydrophilic guidewire until it is crossed.
-Hockey-stick catheter advanced through stricture over the hydrophilic guidewire, and both are then manipulated into the proximal jejunum.

The hydrophilic guidewire is exchanged for a 0.035 inch superstiff guidewire before tract dilatation.
-Tract through liver is dilated with a 7-Fr dilator and a 9-Fr peel-away sheath. 
-If the lesion is not appropriate for stenting, an internal/external biliary drainage catheter is placed, commonly an 8.3-Fr Ring catheter with 32 or 42 side-holes (32 for low CBD obstruction, 42 for hilar obstruction).
-The peel-away sheath protects liver parenchyma, prevents buckling of guidewire and catheter in the perihepatic space, and helps direct the pushing force applied to the catheter down the BD.
-The Ring catheter is placed well into the duodenum, and the guidewire is removed. CM is injected and the catheter withdrawn until CM is seen to opacify the biliary tree proximal to the obstruction, implying that there are catheter side-holes above and below the level of obstruction.
-Catheter placed to gravity drainage and attached to a bag.

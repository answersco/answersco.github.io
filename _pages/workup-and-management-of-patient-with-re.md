title: "Workup and management of patient with recurrent PE despite IVC filter"
---
If patient can be anticoagulation, no further evaluation is needed. Treat appropriately.

Patients who can't be anticoagulation require evaluation of source of PE.
Discovery of new LE DVT, trapped thrombus in filter, or thrombus extending above filter suggest filter failure. In these situations, a second device should be placed, usually in suprarenal IVC.

Lateral resolution: ability to resolve objects in a distance perpendicular to the beam direction &#8594; depends on transducer element width
Lateral resolution improves with a thinner beam&#8594; thinnest at the end of the near-field (at the focal zone)
Lateral resolution is highest at the focal zone
Worst in areas close to and far from the transducer surface (away from the focal zone)
Depth-dependent &#8594; lateral resolution worsens in the deeper field

Lateral resolution: ability to resolve objects in a distance perpendicular to the beam direction &#8594; depends on transducer element width

Depth-dependent &#8594; lateral resolution worsens in the deeper field
Increasing gain worsens lateral resolution, because it widens the beam. 

Improved by:
- narrowing the beam in the proximal field (adding an acoustic lens)
-minimizing gain
-using phased array with multiple focal zones
-increasing the line density (lines/cm).

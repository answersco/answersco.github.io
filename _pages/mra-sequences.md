2D-TOF MRA: uses GRE sequence with saturation pulse employed to null venous or arterial blood flow
-Small voxel size

3D-TOF MRA: Collected as 3D volume instead of slices, and allows for smaller voxels than 2D. Well-suited for high-flow arterial systems like COW.
-Benefits include higher SNR than 2D, shorter imaging time, smoother vessel contours, and better saturation.

Phase-contrast MRA: uses bipolar gradients to create contrast from flow. High velocity encoding time (VENC) is needed for arterial imaging, lower VENC for veins and sinuses. 
-Phase contrast MRA is a quantitative image: can measure mean blood flow velocity and direction.

In general, TOF MRA is faster and less sensitive to signal loss from turbulent vessels than phase-contrast.
Phase contrast has advantages of better background suppression and decreased sensitivity to intravoxel dephasing.

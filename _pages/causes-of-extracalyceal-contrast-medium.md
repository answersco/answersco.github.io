title: "Causes of extracalyceal contrast medium:"
---
Extracalyceal contrast medium: contrast shouldn't normally be seen beyond the calyces on excretory urogram&#8594; may be due to papillary necrosis, tubular ectasia, or calyceal diverticulum
Tubular ectasia: causes paintbrush-like streaks of contrast that extend from the papillae into the tubules on excretory urogram
Medullary sponge kidney: tubular ectasia with associated calcifications of the renal medullary pyramids
Calyceal diverticulum: outpouching of the collecting system in the corticomedullary region. May have depending sediment or small stones.
Papillary necrosis

title: "Rationale for gastropexy"

Literature indicates that routine use is probably not necessary.
Theoretical advantages:
-Larger catheters can be placed de novo
-Catheters and guidewires don't buckle into peritoneal cavity
-Peritoneal leakage of gastric contents less likely
-Catheter can be replaced if inadvertently pulled out soon after procedure.

Gastropexy is important in patients with ascites in whom gastropexy and regular paracentesis are necessary to prevent tube dislodgement.

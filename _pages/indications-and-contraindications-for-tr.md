title: "Indications and contraindications for treatment of uterine fibroids"
---
Indications for intervention: symptomatic fibroids that cause heavy, prolonged periods (menorrhagia), pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and pressure symptoms on adjacent symptoms (bowel, bladder, ureter).
Hormonal therapy and pharmacologic induction of menopause (GnRH agonists) are often effective, but often can't be used long-term.

UAE: indications are identical to those for surgical therapy = symptomatic fibroids that have not responded to conservative therapy.
-Currently not performed for non-fibroid causes of pelvic pain other than selected cases of adenomyosis.
-# of fibroids is not a limitation for UAE
-Fibroids that are largely intracavitary may be expelled after embo, but are not a contraindication.
-Some consider very large fibroids (&gt;10-12 cm) to be a contraindication, but this is debated.
-Suspected active pelvic or GU infection, pregnancy, fibroids enlarging after menopause, vaginal bleeding after menopause, or suspected pelvic malignancy should not be embolized.

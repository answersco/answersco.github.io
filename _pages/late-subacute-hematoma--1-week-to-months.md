Late subacute hematoma (1 week to months) &#8594; extracellular methemoglobin (after RBC lysis).
Methemoglobin PEDDI effect persists&#8594; continued hyperintensity on T1-weighted images.
Paramagnetic effects of methemoglobin lessen&#8594; signal intensity on T2 increases to that of CSF.
May be peripheral enhancement of a subacute to chronic hematoma.

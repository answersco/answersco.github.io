title: "Creation of antibody diversity"
---
1) antibody genes
-human body can shuffle these in many different ways to make a seemingly limitless variety of antibodies
2) early development of B cells
-sections of the antibody genes are rearranged along their chromosome, cut and spliced back together again so they are unique
3) rearrangement due to enzymes cutting and pasting
-different combinations of V (Variable), D (Diversity), and J (Joining) genes creates new versions of the antibody proteins - found on heavy chains on antibodies which is the biggest chain

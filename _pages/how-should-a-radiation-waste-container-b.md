title: "How should a radiation waste container be labeled?"
---
The containers must not provide any radiation shielding for the material.

When full, they should be sealed. Attach identification tag that includes the date sealed and the longest lived radionuclide in the container. It should then be transferred to the decay-in-storage area. It can be discarded as in-house waste when its activity cannot be distinguished from background. Record disposal date, survey instrument used, background date, dose rate measured at the surface of each waste container, and the person who performed the disposal.

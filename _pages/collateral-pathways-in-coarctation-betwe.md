title: "Collateral pathways in coarctation between left CCA and left subclavian artery origins"
---
In the unusual situation of coarctation of Ao between left CCA and left subclavian artery origins, there is low or reversed flow in the left subclavian arteries.
Descending thoracic Ao also receives collateral supply form right subclavian artery branches through communication with mediastinal and intercostal arteries.
Lower extremities receive blood via communication between the right internal mammary artery and the inferior epigastric artery in the anterior abdominal wall.
The right subclavian artery and its branches can become quite enlarged with longstanding distal arch coarctation.

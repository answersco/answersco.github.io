title: "Imaging in popliteal artery aneurysm"
---
Imaging should include the abdominal Ao and both popliteal arteries
US: excellent initial modality.
-Presence of mural thrombus is diagnostic of aneurysm even if diameter is &lt; 2 cm.
-Proportionally large pop in setting of diffuse arteriomegaly doesn't constitute an aneurysm.
-Angio is useful for accurate delineation of runoff before intervention, but can fail to detect aneurysms that are noncalcified and lined with mural thrombus

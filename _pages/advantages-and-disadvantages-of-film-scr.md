title: "Advantages and disadvantages of film-screen and DR"
---
Film-screen limitations:
Intolerant to errors in exposure &#8594; leads to loss of contrast
Noise&#8594; compton scatter increases with increasing film size
Quality of films breaks down over time
No post-processing

Film-screen advantage: slightly better spatial resolution than CR (5 lp/mm versus 2.5 lp/mm)

DR advantages:
Easily stored and manipulated with post-processing
Higher dose efficiency
Wider dynamic range of detection
Superior contrast resolution

Current is passed through tungsten (reason tungsten is because it has an extremely high melting point)
This make electrons extremely energetic and then some &quot;boil off&quot; which is called THERMIONIC EMISSION
Note the tungsten filament is a CATHODE (negative charge) which repels the electrons toward an ANODE (positively charged)
As they accelerate, they gain kinetic energy KeV, and when they hit the anode they lose energy via three means: 
1. Excitation: only makes HEAT, NO x-ray
2. Ionization: xray producing
3. Radiative loss: xray producing

Electron cup: This thing sits by the cathode and makes sure the electron beam strikes the target in an acceptable size
Anode fact: the smaller the anode, the higher the spatial resolution however you also generate more heat

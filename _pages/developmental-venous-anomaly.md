title: "Developmental Venous Anomaly"
---
Best diagnostic clue
&quot;Medusa head&quot; (dilated medullary white matter veins)
Location
At angle of ventricle
Most common site: Near frontal horn
Other: Adjacent to 4th ventricle
Size
Varies (may be extensive) but usually &lt; 3 cm
Morphology
Umbrella-like collection of enlarged medullary (white matter) veins
Large &quot;collector&quot; vein drains into dural sinus or deep ependymal vein
Usually solitary
Can be multiple in blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome

No a true vascular malformation
&quot;Caput medusa&quot; or &quot;large tree with multiple small branches&quot; are buzz words
This is just variation in normal venous drainage
DO NOT ressect as you'd end up with a venous infarct
Associated with cavernous malformations

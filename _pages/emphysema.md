Permanent enlargement of airspaces distal to terminal bronchiole. Destruction of alveolar walls without obvious fibrosis.

Progressively destroys the walls of the alveoli without clear fibrosis

Flattening of the hemidiaphrams is the most reliable finding
 - enlarge APD and retrosternal space
 - pruning of the blood vessels

-Centri-lobular: MC, aw smoking, favors Upper zones of each lobe (apical to basal gradient)
 - central dot sign: bronchovascular bundle in a lucent expanded 2nd pulmonary lobule 

Panlobular - favors LL, more uniform across the 2 PL
 - Alpha 1 antitrypsin, ritalin lung
 - smoking accerates the process

Para-septal: adjacent to the pleura and septal lines with a peripheral distrobution with inthe 2PL
 - looks like honeycoming

Saber Sheath trachea: narrowed INTRA thoraic trachea
 = COPD

aw PAHTN, 

surgery for volume reduction

-Impaired oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange

-Destruction of the walls of over distended alveoli from oxygen being trapped
causes barrel-chested

-End stage 

-Progresses slowly for years

-Breakdown of alveolar walls from over-distention 
--Increase in dead space
--No gas exchange can occur
--Impaired diffusion so develops hypoxemia
--CO2 elimination is impaired &#8594; Hypercapnia &#8594; Respiratory acidosis
--Over inflation of alveoli and air trapping

damaged alveolar walls means less surface area and lower rate of exchange

-alveolar walls break down meaning lungs has fewer and larger spaces = much less respiratory membrane for gas exchange
-lungs fibrotic and less elastic
-lungs become flabby and cavitated with large spaces
-air passages collapse which obstructs outflow of air
-air trapped in lungs; person becomes barrel-chested
-weaken thoracic muscles b/c spending three to four times the amount of energy just to breathe

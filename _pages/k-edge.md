title: "K-Edge"
---
This is the KeV that corresponds closely to the inner (K shell) binding energy for a given element.
Why is this important: you should select a kVp that is going to give you an xray spectrum that is NEAR the K-edge of a contrast agent like iodine or barium

Practical application: You should have the kVp up to AT LEAST twice the k-edge of whatever contrast material you're using.

EXAMPLE:
- We use a kVp of 60-90 when we image with barium because the K-edge of barium is 33.
REMEMBER: kVp = the maximum energy of the photon beam (but VERY FEW xrays are actually at the maximum energy)
The MAJORITY of the stream is going to be at 1/2 to 1/3 of the kVp putting the average beam energy right at the K-edge for our contrast agent.

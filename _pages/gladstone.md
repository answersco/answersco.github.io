college kids selling weed case that tells us we need PURPOSE for aiding and abetting; can't infer purpose from knowledge; need a NEXUS b/w the accused party and the party he's accused of aiding and abetting; he aided and abetted the buyer, but the Court is looking at if he A&amp;A the seller (which he didn't b/c he lacked this nexus); knowledge is NOT enough to demonstrate purposive intent; specific intent can't be inferred w/o nexus

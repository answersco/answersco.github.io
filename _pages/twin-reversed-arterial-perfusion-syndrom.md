title: "Twin reversed arterial perfusion syndrome"
---
Intraplacental shunting resulting in a pump twin who will supply blood to the other twin.
The recipient twin will not develop a heart: acardiac twin.
The pump twin, unlike the acardiac twin, is usually normal, unless the acardiac is big enough to cause significant heart strain.

Could show with Doppler demonstrating umbilical artery flow toward the acardiac twin, or umbilical vein flow away from the acardiac twin.

-Monochorionic
-one twin pumps blood to other twin
-acardiac twin = no structures upper body
-pump twin = normal
-umbilical artery/vein flow reversed in acardiac twin

This is where one of twins becomes the HEART for the other twin. The other twin literally doesnt develop a heart

The sonographic findings that could be shown are umbilical arterial flow TOWARDS the acardiac twin and umbilical vein flow AWAY from the acardiac twin (THIS IS REVERSED)

title: "Patient with Tuberous sclerosis has a mass at the foramen of Monro. How can the two most common etiologies be distinguished?"
---
Most likely SEGA or subependymal nodule&#8594; best distinguished by size, with lesion &gt; 1 cm suggesting SEGA. If &lt; 1 cm, it should still be followed to exclude a small but growing SEGA.
SEGA: typically 2-3 cm at time of presentation, often causing obstructive hydrocephalus. Subependymal nodules tend to remain &lt; 1 cm and don't cause symptoms.
Both occur in adolescent tuberous sclerosis patients, may calcify, and may show enhancement.

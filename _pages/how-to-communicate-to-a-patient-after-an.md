title: "How to communicate to a patient after an adverse event?"
---
Communication after an adverse event removes barriers that affect patient-practitioner interactions. Examples of good communication include: (1) telling the patient and family what happened in terms they can understand, (2) taking responsibility, (3) apologizing, and (4) explaining what will be done to prevent similar errors, improved transitions of care-specific strategies. Discounting or dismissing errors should be avoided.

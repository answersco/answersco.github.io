title: "IMPORTANT: All things being unchanged (e.g. no AEC), how does entrance skin dose change with your kV?"
---
Entrance skin dose increases as the SQUARE of the kVp change (e.g. quadruples if you double kVp)

- IN practice, increasing kVp will increase your beam penetration and potentially allow you to decrease mA with AEC, which potentially reduces the patient dose

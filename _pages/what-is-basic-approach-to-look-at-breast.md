title: "What is basic approach to look at breast MRI (4 steps)"
---
1) look at background uptake (adjusts sensitivity level)

2) look for masses or foci (little dots)
- associated features such as spiculated

3) look at washout curve
- morphology of lesion trumps washout curve

4) New masses --&gt; BR4 or 5
NMLE --&gt; BR4 if new
T2 stuff --&gt; BR2 mostly

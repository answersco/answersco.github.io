title: "Biliary Atresia"
---
Best diagnostic clue
Hepatobiliary scans show lack of radiotracer excretion into intestines
Initially, hepatocyte function is preserved, but with prolonged symptoms, hepatocyte function deteriorates
Morphology
Often confused with neonatal hepatitis, a nonsurgical disease
Gallbladder is present in up to 25%

Obstructive/conjugated bili.
Progressive cirrhosis and death. 

Tracer not excreted into small bowel or gallbladder (usually)

Treatment is kasai portoenterostomy - palliative. Jejunum anastomosed to liver capsule. 80% 10 year survival

Failure to form or early destruction of extrahepatic biliary tree (actually have proliferation of the INTRAHEPATIC ducts)
Clinical: Think about this in kids who have newborn jaundice BEYOND 2 weeks (also think about neonatal hepatitis)
Tx: Need corrective surgey BEFORE 3 months or else they will develop cirrhosis
Dx: best test is HIDA
Fact 1: Associated with trisomy 18 and polysplenia
Fact 2: gallbladder may or may not be abscent IF GB is normal this SUPPORTS hepatitis over atresa
Fact 3: A lot of these kids get biopsy to RULEOUT Alagille syndrome which is heredetary cholestasis from PAUCITY of intrahepatic bile ducts

look for triangle cord sign (this is echogenic material anterior to the portal vein at the porta hepatic) - see image

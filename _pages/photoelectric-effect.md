Photoelectric absorption occurs when an incoming photon (or e-) transfers all its energy to an inner shell electron, ejecting it from the atom (called the photoelectron). Either a characteristic x-rays is subsequently emitted when outer shell e- falls to fill the inner e- void or an Auger e- is emitted. These characteristic x-rays are usually locally absorbed (because in soft tissue they are generally &lt;10keV and never leave the body). The photoelectron (and the Auger e-, if created) can cause subsequent ionizations depending on the energy (delta ray).

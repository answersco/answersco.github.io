title: "How to remember which anterior oblique to use to open up femoral and iliac bifurcations?"
---
&quot;IO in SF&quot;

Opposite for iliac (RAO for left iliac)
Same for femoral (RAO for RIGHT femoral)

You also use the SAME side for subclavian and renals!
 (When in doubt, pick the ipsilateral; unless it's the ILIACS!)

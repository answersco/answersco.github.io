title: "IPMN"
---
Elderly males, grandfather tumor, greatest age and sex variability, benign to aggressive, main duct type has greatest malignant potential, continuity with duct or side branch, nodular or enhancing component raises concern, resected &gt;3cm, mural nodule or &gt;1 cm pancreatic duct dilitation

IPMN: most commonly elderly males (grandfather tumor), but greatest age and sex variability of cystic pancreatic neoplasms
Spectrum of biological behavior from benign to aggressive carcinoma (&#8593; malignant potential for main duct IPMNs)
Classic endoscopic appearance: fish-mouth papilla pouring out mucin
Any nodular or enhancing component should raise concern for malignancy
Controversial imaging recommendations:
Simple pancreatic cysts &lt; 1 cm should be followed annually with imaging (usually MRI)
Suspected IPMN generally resected if &gt; 3 cm in size, if it has a mural nodule, or if there is associated dilatation of pancreatic duct to &gt; 10 mm

SIDE branch &gt; 3 cm

MAIN duct &gt; 10 mm --&gt; cancer
-can look like chronic pancreatitis

IPMN: mucin-producing tumors that arise from duct epithelium.
Side-branch: &quot;common one&quot;
Typically appears as a small, cystic mass, often head or uncinate process.
If large amounts of mucin are produced, it may cause main duct enlargement.
Lesions &lt; 3 cm are usually benign.

Main-Branch: much higher risk of malignancy than side-branch
Produces diffuse dilation of main duct
May see atrophy of the gland and dystrophic calcifications&#8594; mimics chronic pancreatitis.
All are considered malignant, and should be resected.

Features worrisome for malignancy:
Main duct &gt; 10 mm (some say &gt; 1.5 cm)
DIffuse or multifocal involvement
Enhancing nodules
Solid hypovascular mass.

SIDE branch &gt; 3 cm bad, small cystic mass in the head with main duct enlargement

MAIN duct &gt; 10 mm --&gt; higher risk for cancer
-can look like chronic pancreatitis

Malignant features = main duct &gt;10mm, diffuse or multifocal, enhancing nodule or solid hypovascular mass

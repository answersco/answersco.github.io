title: "Subependymoma"

...

frontal horn or floor of 4th ventricle - attached to septum pellucidum. may have patchy/solid enhancement. may calcify.

WHO grade I. Most are asymptomatic. Well-circumscribed lobulated intraventricular mass. Isodense to hypodense at CT. Frequent calcification (33%) and cystic degeneration (20%). Low T1 and high T2 signal. Hypointensity on T1WIs and hyperintensity on T2WIs are seen on MR. Enhancement not as diffuse as in central neurocytoma.

CT isointense + T1 Isointense + nonenhancing + T2 slight hyperintense. 
Older adults, inferior fourth ventricle/obex + foramen of Monroe * easy to miss + low-grade

Subependymomas are uncommon, benign (WHO grade I) tumours which are slow growing and non-invasive. middle aged to older individuals (typically 5th to 6th decades 3) . There is a slight male predilection (M:F 2.3:1) 6. 

Clinical presentation
Typically patients are asymptomatic and small lesions are discovered incidentally. 

fourth ventricle: 50-60%
lateral ventricles: 30-40%
third ventricle: rare
central canal of the spinal cord: rare

DDX:
ependymoma
intraventricular meningioma
central neurocytoma (particularly if close to 3rd ventricle)
cerebral metastasis

Found in ADULTS
Most common at the foramen of monroe and the 4th ventricle

-older adults
-inferior aspect of fourth ventricle, foramen of Munro
-NO ENHANCEMENT
-T2 bright

ADULT tumor, 4th &amp; lateral vents near foramen of Monroe, &lt; 2cm, a/w obstructive hydrocephalus, calcs and T2 bright, NO enhancement

title: "Magic angle in the knee"
---
PCL and patellar tendon may have foci of intermediate signal on sagittal images with short TE sequences (T1, PD, GRE) where tendon forms an angle of 55 degrees with magnetic field&#8594; magic angle phenomenon
Goes away on T2 sequences (long TE)
Reduced at higher field strengths (due to greater shortening of T2 relaxation times)

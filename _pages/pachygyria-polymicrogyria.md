title: "Pachygyria-Polymicrogyria"
---
Excessively small and prominent convolutions
Predilection for perisylvian regions; when bilateral, often syndromic
Small irregular gyri, but cortex appears normal or thick on MR
May appear as deep infolding of thick cortex
MR comprehensively assesses malformation; NECT for suspected Ca++ (TORCH)
Best Sequence: Volume 3D SPGR (T1-weighted) in mature brain; thin section T2WI if unmyelinated

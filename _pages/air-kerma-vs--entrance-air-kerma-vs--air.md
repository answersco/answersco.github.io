title: "Air kerma vs. entrance air kerma vs. air kerma product (KAP)"
---
Air kerma: the sum of kinetic energy of all charged particles made when an x-ray or gamma ray passes through a unit mass of air.

Entrance air kerma: this is the air where the x-ray beam would enter the patient (measured without the patient).

KAP: supposed to account for the total amount of radiation on the patient.
-Calculated by multiplying the entrance air kerma and the cross-sectional area.
-KAP IS INDEPENDENT OF THE SOURCE DISTANCE. This is because changes in beam intensity (from inverse square law) are matched exactly by changes in cross-sectional area.

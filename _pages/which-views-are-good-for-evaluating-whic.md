title: "Which views are good for evaluating which areas?"
---
Vertical long-axis&#8594; good for evaluating the anterior and inferior walls and apex of the LV
Plane chosen on axial image that bisects the mitral valve and intersects the LV apex

Horizontal long-axis (4-chamber view) &#8594; good for evaluating the septal and lateral walls and apex of the LV, the RV free wall, and overall chamber size
Also good visualization of mitral and tricuspid valves
The chosen plane is perpendicular to the vertical long-axis image, intersecting the lower &#8531; of the MV and the LV apex

Short axis: shows cross-sections of the LV and RV&#8594; useful for volumetric measurements
Series of slices are perpendicular to the long axis of the LV

Three-Chamber View: shows the aortic root and aortic valve, the LV outflow tract, the mitral valve, and the anteroseptal and inferolateral walls of the LV

Aortic (&quot;Candy-Cane&quot;) view&#8594; shows entire thoracic aorta and some of its branches
Axial image plane bisects the ascending and descending aorta

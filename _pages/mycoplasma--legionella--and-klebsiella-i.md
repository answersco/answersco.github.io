Mycoplasma PNA: varied appearance, and can produce consolidation, areas of GGO, centrilobular nodules, and tree-in-bud nodules
Legionella (most commonly elderly smokers): peripheral consolidation often progresses to lobar and multifocal PNA
Klebsiella (alcoholics and aspirators): classically leads to voluminous inflammatory exudates, causing the bulging fissure sign.

Best diagnostic clue
Calcified subependymal nodules (hamartomas)
98% have subependymal nodules (SENs)
Location
Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) arise in 15%; most located at foramen of Monro
Cortical/subcortical tubers (95%)
Frontal &gt; parietal &gt; occipital &gt; temporal &gt; cerebellum
&#8593; number tubers &#8594; &#8593; neurologic symptoms
White matter radial migration lines (WMRMLs)
Represent heterotopic glia + neurons along path of cortical migration from ventricle to cortex
Cyst-like white matter lesions (cystoid brain degeneration)
Size
Thickened cortex, enlarged gyri associated with cortical/subcortical tubers
SEN that grows over time and measures &gt; 1.3 cm = SEGA
Morphology
Pyramidal-shaped gyral expansion
20% have &quot;eye-of-potato&quot; central depression

The presence of subependymal nodules (Fig. 1, ) and the numerous cortical/subcortical hyperintensities (best seen on the FLAIR scans, Figs. 2-3, ) are classic for tuberous sclerosis complex. In this setting, an enhancing nodule at the foramen of Monro (Figs. 4-5, ) is most likely a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA). As these tumors are WHO grade I lesions and typically do not invade the brain, surveillance imaging for enlargement or the development of obstructive hydrocephalus is indicated. In many cases, SEGAs are now treated with mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus.

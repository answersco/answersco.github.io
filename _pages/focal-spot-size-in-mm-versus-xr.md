title: "Focal spot size in MM versus XR"
---
MM: 0.3 mm, 0.1 mm (mag)
XR: 0.6 mm and 1.2 mm

Requires lower mA (due to heat tolerance of small focal spot) &#8594; limited to 50 mA for 0.1 mm, 100 for 0.3 mm
Also longer exposure times (try to keep below 2 seconds)

Cathode side aligned with chest wall
Loss of energy on anode side (nipple side) compensated for by angling the tube up to about 20 degrees
Effective anode angle = anode angle + tube angle

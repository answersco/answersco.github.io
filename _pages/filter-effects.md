title: "Filter effects:"
---
- Decreases beam intensity
- Increases mean beam energy
- Slightly decreases contrast
Advantages:
- Gross reduction in patient dose over unfiltered beam
Disadvantages:
- Reduction in beam intensity
-X-ray technique must be increased to compensate
-- Increased tube loading
-- Longer exposure times
-- Patient motion

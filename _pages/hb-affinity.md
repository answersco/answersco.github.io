title: "Hb affinity"

Which has a better affinity for oxygen between fetal and adult? 

Fetal because they are stealing oxygen from mother's hemoglobin, it is better that their affinity is higher than the mother's bc the hemoglobin in fetuses cells could not get to the oxygen if the mom's hemoglobin was higher than fetuses bc they would steal the oxygen and never give it to the child

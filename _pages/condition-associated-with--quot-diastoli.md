title: "Condition associated with &quot;diastolic bounce&quot; of the interventricular septum"
---
Constrictive pericarditis: historically was secondary to TB or viral, now more commonly iatrogenic form CABG or XRT.

Pericardium is thick (&gt;0.4 cm). Calcification is diagnostic, usually largest over AV groove.

&quot;Sigmoidization&quot; on SSFP cine imaging: ventricular septum moves toward the LV in a wavy pattern during early diastole (&quot;diastolic bounce&quot;). The bounce is most pronounced during inspiration (indicating ventricular interdependence).

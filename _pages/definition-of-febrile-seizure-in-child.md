---
Febrile seizures that last &#8804; 15 minutes and do not recur within 24 hours are termed &quot;simple&quot; febrile seizures. Note that 2-5% of all children between the ages of 3 months and 5 years experience a febrile seizure. Approximately 1/3 of them will have at least 1 recurrence. Imaging is not indicated in a simple childhood febrile seizure.

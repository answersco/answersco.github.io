title: "Graphical tools in quality and safety: Control chart"

Control chart (AKA Shewart chart): aim to analyze the performance of a process or system in a common language and as a function of time.

By analyzing performance, a control chart (CC) is used to control, monitor, and enhance process performance over time by recognizing changes and their sources.

CC uses samples of success as the numerator and total opportunities as the denominator, with events graphed to show how a process changes over time. 
A line can be used to illustrate deviations of data from the average, with upper and lower control limits used to represent the acceptable range. These lines can help determine whether the process change is stable (consistent) or unstable (unpredictable), which helps determine whether process variations are in or out of the team's control.

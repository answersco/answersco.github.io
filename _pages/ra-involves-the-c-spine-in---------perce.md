title: "RA involves the C-spine in _______ percent of patients with RA? What about the Thoracic and lumbar spine?"
---
70% in the C-spine; as the disease is more long-standing (and more severe) the incidence of c-spine involvement increases

The thoracic and lumbar spine are ALMOST NEVER involved in RA

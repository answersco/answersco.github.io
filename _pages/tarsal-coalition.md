Type types: fibrous/cartilaginous &amp; Osseous 
Fibrous/cartilaginous = more common 
You can have coalition between the talus and the calcaneus as well as between the talus and navicular
Talocalcaneal: occurs between the middle facet, continuous C SIGN, Talar beak (spur on the anterior talus) seen in about 25% of cases (image)
Calcaneonavicular coalition: This occurs between the ANTERIOR facet and causes the ant eater sign (which is the communication or osseous bridge between the talus and the navicular)

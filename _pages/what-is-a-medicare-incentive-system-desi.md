title: "What is a Medicare incentive system designed to promote reporting of quality information, and an example of its use?"

PQRS (Physician Quality Reporting System): 
Provides cash incentives to physicians who report certain medical conditions (example of pay-for-performance).
Participation is currently voluntary, but may become mandatory for full Medicare reimbursement.
Example: reporting of the presence or absence of carotid artery stenosis according to the NASCET (N American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) criteria, which calculates the degree of stenosis with reference to the lumen of the carotid distal to the stenosis.

Dx is made by lack of flow to the brain through the internal carotid arteries. With brain specific agents, no uptake will be seen on delayed images. The 'hot nose' sign is diverted blood flow to the c-spine region.

False negatives can occur when scalp perfusion is mistaken for intra-cerebral blood flow. This can happen in the setting of scalp trauma. Additionally, some activity within the superior sagittal sinus can be seen even in brain death.

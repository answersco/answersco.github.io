Balloon-expandable: higher radial force upon deployment, but will not rebound if crushed. 
Suboptimal for sites prone to external compression (e.g. around joints or the adductor canal in the leg).
Self-expandable: more flexible and trackable through vessels than balloon-expandable. 
Use is favored when the route to the lesion is tortuous or when the anatomy is prone to external compression.
Stent should generally be selected that is 1-2 cm longer than the stenosis, with a diameter that is 1-2 mm wider than the unstenosed vessel lumen.
Rule of thumb: 10% oversizing of arterial stent; 20% oversizing of venous stent.
Most stents are fenestrated and provide only a scaffolding-like support.
Covered stents are employed for treatment of pseudoaneurysm, dissection, and TIPS.

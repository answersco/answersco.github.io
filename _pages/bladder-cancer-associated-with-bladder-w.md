Bladder wall calcification: think TB or schistosomiasis
Schistosomiasis&#8594; can lead to squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder
See heavily calcified bladder (usually entire bladder) and distal ureters.

TB: more commonly involves upper GU tract, but can lead to a thick, contracted bladder, +/- calcifications.
Leukoplakia: associated with ureteral SCC

title: "How is linearity measured"
---
High activity Tc-99m source (50-300 mCi) measured at T0 and at 48 h (or other predetermined time but must be less than 48h) Then the expected and actual measurements are compared. From this comparison it is determined if the instrument is linear throughout the activity range.
: the test passed because the activity decreased with time as expected

title: "Failed revascularization: &gt; 30 days"
---
After 3 months, and up to 1 year after the intervention, intimal hyperplasia is the main cause of failure
-The more extensive the area treated, the higher likelihood.
-Drug-eluting balloons/stents, and stent-grafts show some promise in improving success rates.

Kinked or crushed stents can cause failure at any point

After 1 year, failure is more likely due to progression of the original disease in the inflow or outflow vessels.

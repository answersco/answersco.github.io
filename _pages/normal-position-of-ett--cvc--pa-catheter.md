title: "Normal position of ETT, CVC, PA catheter:"
---
ETT: should be ~4-6 cm above the carina with neck in neutral alignment
In situations with low pulmonary compliance (e.g. ARDS), tip position closer to carina may reduce barotrauma

CVC: tip should be in lower SVC or cavoatrial junction
Azygos malposition: associated with &#8593; risk of venous perforation and catheter-associated thrombosis&#8594; repositioning recommended.
Dialysis catheter should terminate in RA.

PA catheter (Swan-Ganz): tip should be in either main, R, or L PA
If tip is distal to the proximal interlobar PA&#8594; risk of PA rupture or pseudoaneurysm.

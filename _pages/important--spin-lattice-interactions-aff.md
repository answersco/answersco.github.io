title: "IMPORTANT: Spin lattice interactions affect which parameter, T1 or T2 and how?"
---
Increased spin-lattice interactions cause faster recovery of T1 longitudinal mag. It provides the &quot;kick (energy transfer)&quot; required to recover longitudinal mag. SO if there are MORE spin lattice interactions, T1 is faster and if there are MINIMAL spin lattice interactions, T1 recovery is slower (i.e. in CSF)

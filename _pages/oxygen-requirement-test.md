title: "Oxygen requirement test"
---
-oxygen gradient in test tubes meaning the most oxygen is towards the top of the tube and the further you go down, the less oxygen there is 
-the microbe will only grow in the special media test tube where they prefer their oxygen
EX. cloudiest at top = microbes requires oxygen
cloudiest at bottom = microbes prefer zero to no oxygen

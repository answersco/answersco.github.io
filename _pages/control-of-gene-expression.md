title: "Control of gene expression"
---
-a protein-encoding gene contains some controls over its own expression: the promoter sequence and extra copies of gene
-much control of gene expression occurs in two general processes:
1) chromatin remodeling = &quot;on/off&quot; switch
2) microRNA's = &quot;dimmer&quot; switch

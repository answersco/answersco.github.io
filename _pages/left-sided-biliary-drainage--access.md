title: "Left-sided biliary drainage: access"
---
Left-sided biliary drainage is typically performed when the patient has a hilar stricture, and may be more technically challenging.
-Segment-3 BD usually chosen for entry. It courses inferiorly toward the inferior margin of the left lobe.
-If the patient has a large enough left lobe, it may permit access of a segment-2 duct, which has a more horizontal course in the left lobe, offering the advantage of a more gentle curve with less acute angle.
-For patients with hilar obstruction, it is important to gain access to the left biliary system in as peripheral a location as the anatomy allows.
-22-g Chiba needle used to access the segment 2 or 3 duct, and contrast is injected to outline biliary system. 
-0.018 wire is manipulated toward hilum, followed by the 5-Fr sheath system as on the right.
-The hydrophilic guidewire and Kumpe catheter are used to negotiate the stricture and placed in proximal jejunum.
-Tract dilated over a 0.035 in superstiff guidewire.
-9-Fr sheath is particularly important for access of a segment-3 duct because it helps direct the pushing force down the CBD, making catheter placement easier.

title: "Penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU): diagnosis and treatment"
---
PAU: the result of unroofing of an atherosclerotic aortic intimal plaque, resulting in focal partial or full thickness defect in the aortic wall.
-Almost always in setting of pre-existing aortic athero, usually in descending thoracic Ao, with 1/3 having more than one ulceration.

Imaging:
-Ao diameter often normal
-Characteristic punched-out, undermined appearance. 
-Evidence of intramural blood, periaortic stranding, pleural effusion (30%), focal aneurysm formation, or periaortic hematoma should also be present.
-DDX includes mycotic aneurysm and trauma.

Tx:
-Medical treatment, unless in ascending thoracic aorta (surgical).
-Descending thoracic aortic PAU is an ideal lesion for endograft repair.
-Covering ulcer prevents progression, controls pain, and can be accomplished with a single short endograft.

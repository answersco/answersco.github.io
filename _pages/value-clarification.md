title: "Value clarification"
---
-essential for nurses
-when nurses understand the values that motivate pt's decisions and behaviors, they can tap into these values when teaching and counseling pt's
-this means: if I have a pt who does not value heath by not takin meds or following diet. But you found out he values being a good dad. So you can go with that if he wants to be a good dad, he needs to take care of himself to be there for his kids and be a dad.

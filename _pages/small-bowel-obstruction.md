title: "Small Bowel Obstruction"
---
SB &gt; 3 cm diameter on radiographs, 2.5 cm on CT
Air-fluid levels on upright or decubitus radiograph
Transition zone between dilated and collapsed bowel is critical to define presence, site, and cause of obstruction 
All better determined on CT than on plain films (accuracy near 100% for high-grade SBO)
Small bowel feces sign: Gas bubbles mixed with particulate matter in dilated loops just proximal to site of obstruction 
 &quot;Positive&quot; oral contrast medium for CT is rarely useful
Closed loop obstruction
 SB segments are markedly distended (&gt; 4 cm) by fluid, little gas
Whirl sign due to tightly twisted mesenteric vessels
&quot;Balloons-on-strings&quot;: Dilated SB tethered by stretched mesenteric vessels
Strangulating SBO: Impaired blood supply to SB
Absent, decreased, or delayed bowel wall enhancement 
Bowel wall thickening (edema or hemorrhage)
Mesenteric and interloop edema &#177; ascites
Vessels: Congested, thrombosed, or obscured 
Obscured margins among affected SB segments

loops stack up on one another creating a &quot;step ladder&quot; appearance

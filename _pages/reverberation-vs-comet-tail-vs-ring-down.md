title: "Reverberation vs comet tail vs ring-down artifact"
---
Reverberation artifact: looks like multiple equidistantly-spaced linear reflections
Sound wave encounters 2 parallel highly-reflective surfaces&#8594; echoes generated from a primary US beam are repeatedly reflected back and forth
Recorded and displayed as multiple echoes

Comet-tail artifact = a form of reverberation
2 parallel highly-reflective surfaces are closer together, so the sequential echoes are closely spaced.
If the distance between them is less than &#189; the SPL (required for axial resolution) &#8594; displayed echoes look like a triangle

Ring-down artifact: line or series of parallel bands extending posterior to a collection of gas
Sound wave encounters fluid trapped between a tetrahedron of air bubbles &#8594; the vibrations create a nearly continuous sound wave transmitted back to the probe

title: "Infiltrate:"
---
Non specific term &quot;loosely&quot; used to describe substance other than air/normal lung tissue on chest radiograph. Examples of infiltrates include fluid/pulmonary edema, consolidation/infection, and even some tumors such as bronchiolavolar carcinoma. Consolidation may be thought of as a dense more &quot;solid&quot; infiltrate and is usually caused by pneumonia.

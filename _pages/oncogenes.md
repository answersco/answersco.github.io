-proto-oncogenes are genes that promote cell division
-expression at the wrong time of development or place in the body leads them to function as oncogenes
-activation is associated with: point mutation, chromosomal translocation, &amp; inversion
-activation causes a gain-of-function

-when proto-oncogenes that have mutated are cancer-causing genes
-more than 100
-cause cancer if inappropriately activated 
-activation causes a gain-of-function
-activation is associated with:
1) point mutation
2) chromosomal translocation
3) inversion

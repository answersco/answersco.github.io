1) single cell when an oncogene is turned on or tumor suppressor gene turned off, lifting controls on cell division and making the cell immortal
-may result from inherited mutation or exposure to radiation, viruses, or chemicals that cause mutation in a somatic cell
2) malignancy results from a series of mutations
-an affected cell divides more often than the cell type it descends from and eventually loses its specialized characteristics
3) grow and spread by inducing formation of blood vessels to nourish them and breaking away from original location
-abnormal cells undergo further genetic and surface changes as they travel

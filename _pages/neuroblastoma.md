title: "Neuroblastoma"
---
Most common abdominal malignancy in newborn
Rare
Neural crest tissue: adrenal medulla, sympathetic chain, zuckerkandl
Age 2 years (better prognosis &lt;1year)
Elevated VMA and HVA 
paraneoplastic syndromes
US:
solid tumor, hyperechoic, calcifications 85%, crosses midline, encases vessles
METS: 
bone, neural foramina, LN, liver,lung

Neuroblastoma &#8594; mean age at diagnosis of 2 years
Typically suprarenal mass, with calcification in 50%
Tends to encase vessels, while Wilms usually displaces vessels
Positive on I-123 MIBG
Often invades into neural foramina and spinal canal, often with restricted diffusion.
75% with metastases, commonly bone marrow (usually permeative and lytic), classically with intracranial, subdural mass originating from marrow.

I123/131 MIBG and bone scan

Nontender abdominal mass associated with elevated VMA and HVA.
Most common extracranial malignancy in childhood
Typically kids are very young. You CAN be born with this tumor

STAGING OF NEUROBLASTOMA
1. Becomes upstaged if it CROSSED MIDLINE, has CONTRALATERAL NODES. Both of these make the tumor stage 3
2. Stage 4S: this is if diagnosed before 1 year of age and distant mets are confined to the liver, skin, or bone MARROW (not the cortex). Thoracic primary also does better

Also, really the ONLY pediatric tumor that mets to bones

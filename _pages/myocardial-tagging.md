Myocardial tagging: technique that is useful in assessing ventricular function
By modulating the magnetization gradient, the signal from myocardium can be nulled in a grid pattern prior to the onset of image acquisition
At imaging, this dark-appearing grid moves with the tissue that was tagged by the null signal.
Areas of myocardium that are not contracting appropriately will demonstrate decreased deformation of the grid during the cardiac cycle
Can be used to calculate &quot;Strain&quot; by degree of deformation of grid lines

Tagging can also be applied to imaging pericardial disease &#8594; evaluate for areas of thickened pericardium adhered to myocardium

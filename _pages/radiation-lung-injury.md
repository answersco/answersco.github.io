title: "Radiation lung injury:"
---
Radiation lung injury: up to 40% develop imaging abnormalities, but most are asymptomatic
Radiographic abnormality is largely confined to the radiation port, usually with non-anatomic linear margins.
Radiation pneumonitis: early stage of XRT injury
Can occur within 1 month of XRT, most severe 3-4 months post-treatment.
Features ground-glass centered on the radiation port, although extension out of the port is relatively common.
Radiation fibrosis: late stage of XRT injury
Becomes apparent ~6-12 months after therapy
Key finding is the distribution of fibrosis and traction bronchiectasis within the radiation port
Fibrosis may extend outside the port in 20%

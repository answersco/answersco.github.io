title: "Relationship between relative biological effectiveness (RBE) and linear energy transfer (LET)"
---
RBE: Defined as the dose of 250 kVp x-rays necessary to produce a specific radiobiological effect, divided by the dose of test radiation required to produce that same radiobiological effect.
RBE increases as LET increases, with a peak around an LET value of 100 keV/micrometer, which corresponds to the approximate diameter of the DNA double helix

title: "In SE sequences, flow artifacts are (dark/bright) In GRE sequences, flow artifacts are (dark/bright)"

SE: flow looks dark 
- 90 degree pulse moves the blood photons out of the way
- since blood flows fast those photons are missed by the 180 degree pulse and no echo is formed (180 refocusing pulse required for an echo)

GRE: flowing blood is bright

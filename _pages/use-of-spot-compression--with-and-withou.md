Spot compression (with or without magnification)
Compression of a focal region&#8594; better compression allows better resolution
Spot compression magnification&#8594; typically used to evaluate calcifications
Usually not needed for mass or asymmetry
Areas of architectural distortion may appear less apparent on magnification views.
If an abnormality doesn't significantly change shape when compressed, it is considered suspicious.

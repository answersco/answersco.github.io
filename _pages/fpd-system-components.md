title: "FPD system components"
---
Entrance surface of FPD: carbon fiber to protect components
CsI needles: act as a phosphor&#8594; convert photons to light
Photodiode array: absorbs light and converts to electrons
Readout elements (transistors and gates):
Determine charges of elements in photodiode array and construct images
No TV camera needed in FPD systems

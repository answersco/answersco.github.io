title: "What things effect specific absorption rate (SAR)? and what are the limits"
---
SAR (watts/kg) estimates the amount of energy deposited in a patient - measures rate the RF pulse dissipates in tissue

SAR = Bo^2 x alpha^2 x duty cycle
-Doubling Bo quadruples SAR
-Doubling flip angle quadruples SAR
-Doubling duty cycle (making TR 1/2) doubles SAR
-SE has higher SAR than GRE due to higher flip angles (especially inversions)

Limits: 
-No tissue shall endure temp increase of &gt; 1 deg C
--FDA limits of 4 W/kg over 15 minutes, and 3 W/kg over 10 minutes.

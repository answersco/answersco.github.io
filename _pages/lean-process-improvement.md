Lean Process Improvement (Lean): an organizational style of continuous improvement workflow management
Emphasis on smoothness of workflow from end to end
Distinct from the 6 Sigma method, which is best used for closing performance gaps or inducing breakthrough improvement in a segment of the overall process

2 core management principles:
1. Relentless elimination of waste
2. Respect for people with long-term business relationships based on continuous improvement and mutual trust
Places large emphasis on standardized work in order to reduce unnecessary variation and eliminate non-value added work. fluctuations in quality and volume, and idiosyncratic behaviors.
Poor flow results from unreasonable work due to poor organization and pushing beyond natural limits.
Organizational culture can be a stumbling block to implementation of Lean because Lean relies heavily on employee engagement at a community level.

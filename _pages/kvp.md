title: "KVP"
---
60-120. ABC control kvp and mAs. As kvp increases 15% there is a able in number of photon. Ideal KVP of 60-80 for k-edge of iodine (33.2 kev)- however with larger its thats not always possible (thus more scatter, noise et).

increasing will decrease contrast but also decr dose (as will Rh/rh and HVL), increases scatter

decreasing cause less scatter, more contrast etc but mA will ramp up and increase dose

a political and economic theory of social organization that advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole (usually in the form of a democratic government)

A theory or system of social organization that advocates the vesting of the ownership and control of the means of production and distribution, of capital, land, etc., in the community as a whole.

Industrialization led to groups that opposed what they saw as exploitation of workers and instead promoted an alternative vision of society where everyone would be equal. What is this belief called?

Socialists advocated government protection of workers from exploitation by property owners and government ownership of industries. This ideology led to the founding of socialist or labor parties in the late 1800s. (709)

Political movement originating in 19 century Europe; emphasized state control of the major means of production

Robert Owens, a key figure in this economic theory, believed profit motive should not be the primary shaper of society; rather, he said he could create a community in which workers were paid what they were worth and shared, rather than competed, in all areas of life.

title: "IR management of obstructed branch vessel in acute dissection"
---
Critical organ ischemia due to dynamic obstruction of a branch vessel can be relieved by covering the entry tear with an endograft.

When this is unsuccessful, and in cases of static obstruction, placement of bare stents from the true lumen of the Ao into the true lumen of the branch vessel may restore flow.

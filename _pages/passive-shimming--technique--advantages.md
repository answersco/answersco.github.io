title: "Passive shimming: technique, advantages, disadvantages."
---
Passive shimming &#8594; relies on strategic placement of small pieces of soft iron around the magnet bore 
&#8594; introduces small, local deviations in the distribution of the magnetic field.
&#8594; If performed correctly, these small changes will counteract the inhomogeneities of the main field &#8594; more uniform field overall.
Advantage: relatively inexpensive
Disadvantage&#8594; very slow, requiring special hardware and software.
The resulting final effect is static
If changes are required at a later time, re-shimming will require substantial downtime (up to several days) to recalculate the shim requirements and modify the amounts of shimming material inside the magnet's bore.

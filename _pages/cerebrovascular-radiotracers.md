Tc-99m DTPA: transient perfusion agent. No uptake within brain parenchyma, as it doesn't cross BBB. Used for planar imaging, and uncommonly.

Tc-99m HMPAO/Tc-99m ECD: perfusion agents that cross the BBB. To be retained in cell, ECD is enzymatically modified. HMPAO simply needs to be protonated to be trapped. ECD is only taken up by living cells, while HMPAO uptake is a marker of perfusion. In evaluation of subacute infarct, luxury perfusion can cause HMPAO uptake to increase (due to increased perfusion), while ECD will show true defect.
ECD generally preferred over HMPAO for brain imaging. Compared to HMPAO, ECD has more rapid blood pool clearance, better shelf life, more accurate characterization of perfusion, and is only taken up by living cells. Both are used for SPECT.

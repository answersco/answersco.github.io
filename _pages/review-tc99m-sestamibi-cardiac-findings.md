title: "Review Tc99m-Sestamibi cardiac findings: - Ischemia - Scar - Stunned myocardium - Hibernating"
---
Ischemia
- decreased perfusion on stress that resolves on rest
- poor contractility

Scar:
- decreased perfusion on stress and rest
- abnormal contractility

Stunned myocardium:
- perfusion normal on stress and rest
- abnormal contractility

Hibernating myocardium:
- decreased perfusion on rest and stress
- take up FDG and redistribute Thallium

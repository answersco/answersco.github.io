title: "Bowel incontinence"
---
-the inability of the anal sphincter to control the discharge of fecal and gaseous material
-the cause of incontinence is usually an organic disease, resulting either in a mechanical condition that hinders the proper functioning of the anal sphincter or an impairment in the nerve supply to the anal sphincter
-mental illness may also cause a patient to be indifferent to the passage of stool
-although bowel incontinence is seldom life-threatening, patients with bowel incontinence suffer embarrassment, may become depressed, and pose a challenge for nurses because of the risk for skin breakdown

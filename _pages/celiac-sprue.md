-malabsorption of gluten

-flocculations
-reversal of jejunal and ileal folds
-Moulage sign = toothpaste from effacement of folds
-cavitary mesenteric lymph nodes
-splenic atrophy

-iron deficiency anemia
-idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis
-dermatitis herpetiformis
-increased risk of T-cell lymphoma and adenocarcinoma

This is malabsorption related to inflammatory response against gluten
Findings:
1. Reversal of small bowel pattern (jejunum becomes more featureless than ileum)
2. Necrotic lymph nodes (low density) - these can had fat fluid levels (see image)
3. Splenic atrophy



Other important associations:
1. Can cause malabsorption of iron
2. Assicated ideopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis
3. Increased risk of bowel wall lymphoma

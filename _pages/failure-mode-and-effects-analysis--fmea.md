Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA): common process used to prospectively identify error risk within a particular process
Begins with a complete process mapping &#8594; identifies all the steps that must take place for a given process to occur
It then identifies the ways in which each step can go wrong (i.e. the failure modes for each step); the probability that each error will be detected; and the consequences or impact of the error if not detected.
The estimates of the likelihood of a particular process, the chance of detecting the failure, and its impact are combined numerically &#8594; produce a criticality index.

The criticality index provides a rough quantitative estimate of the magnitude of hazard posed by each step in a high-risk process &#8594; allows prioritization of targets for improvement.
Using the estimates made to produce the criticality index, all of the steps in a process can be ranked (according to the product of the likelihood and impact estimates)
Steps at the top (those with highest criticality index) can be prioritized for error-proofing.

Pitfalls: reliability is unclear
Different teams analyzing the same process may identify different steps in the process, assign different risks to the steps, and prioritize differently.

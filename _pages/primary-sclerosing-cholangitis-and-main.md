title: "Primary sclerosing cholangitis and main imaging differential consideration:"

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC): associated with UC, and more common in males
Biliary imaging: shows characteristic beaded, irregular appearance of the CBD and intrahepatic bile ducts
Appears similar to HIV-cholangiopathy, although cholangitis in HIV patients is more commonly associated with papillary stenosis
Can lead to cirrhosis, cholangiocarcinoma, and recurrent biliary infections

AIDS cholangitis (AIDS cholangiopathy): patients with AIDS are susceptible to biliary infection with Cryptosporidium and CMV&#8594; present with RUQ pain, fever, and &#8593; LFTs
Imaging is nearly identical to PSC, with multiple strictures and a beaded appearance of the bile ducts.
Distinguishing feature of AIDS cholangitis is papillary stenosis, which is not typically seen in PSC

title: "Elderly and pediatric considerations"
---
-you have learned in other classes that adjustments have to be made for developmental differences in patient care &amp; pharmacology is no different. 
-the nurse needs to consider how the pharmacokinetics is different in these 2 populations, especially due to physiological differences in: kidney function, liver function, &amp; body composition
-most info about drugs has been from healthy adult testing for many reasons, less is known about the effects, uses, and dosages of pediatric medications. 
-only about 25 % of drugs are FDA approved for indications in children but 75 % are used.
-must think about effects of normal growth and development on pharmacokinetics

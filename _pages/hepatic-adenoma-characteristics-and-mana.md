US and CT variable
MRI: fat containing on In/Out of phase
Cold on sulfur colloid

If multiple, consider glycogen storage disease (Von Gierke) or liver adenomatosis
No reliable imaging features to differentiate from HCC
Rarely degenerate into HCC
Often regress after OCPs are stopped.
75% in R hepatic lobe

Management: stop OCPs and re-image- should get smaller
If &lt; 5 cm, they are watched
Often resected if &gt; 5 cm due to propensity for bleeding and rare degeneration into HCC.

title: "IMPORTANT: Explain Weighted CTDI, CTDIvol, DLP, etc?"

Weighted CTDI --&gt; CTDI vol --&gt; DLP --&gt; Effective Dose (&quot;We Can Do Everything!&quot;)

1. Weighted CTDI = 1/3 central CTDI + 2/3 Peripheral CTDI (dose = mGy)

2. CTDI vol = Weighted CTDI/PITCH 
(therefore, pitch relationship to dose is linear; half the pitch doubles dose; triple the pitch 1/3 the dose)

3. DLP = CTDI vol * Length of scan (in mGy-cm)

4. Effective dose = k * DLP (k is the body part constant) = (Sv)

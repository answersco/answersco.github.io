title: "Endoleak types"
---
1: leak at the top (A) or bottom (B) of the graft
-Typically high pressure and require intervention.

2: Most common. Filling of sac via a feeder artery, usually IMA or lumbar artery. Most resolve, but should be followed to ensure stability.

3: Defect/fracture in the graft, usually from pieces that don't fully overlap.

4: Porosity of the graft (4 is from the pore). Doesn't happen with modern grafts.

5: Endotension. Not a true leak, and may be due to pulsation of the graft wall.

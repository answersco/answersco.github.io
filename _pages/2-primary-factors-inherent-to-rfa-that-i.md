Tissue boiling and charring occur with temp &gt; 100 C, acting as an electrical insulator, limiting heat conduction to tumor beyond the area of charring.

Heat-sink effect: ability to obtain adequate thermal heating may be limited by adjacent large blood vessels, wherein rapidly flowing blood carries heat away from the treatment zone.
-Methods to counteract heat sink include: preprocedural hepatic artery embo or temporary occlusion of the hepatic artery and PV during procedure (Pringle maneuver).

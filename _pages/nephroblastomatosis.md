title: "Nephroblastomatosis"

possible precursor to Wilms, association with Beckwith-Wiedemann, hemihypertrophy, Perlman syndrome, trisomy 18, Drash syndrome, sporadic aniridia, WAGR syndrome

Primitive metanephric blastema thought to be precursor of Wilms tumor. Commonly seen in neonate kidneys. Normally regress by 4 months of age. Bilateral lobulated and enlarged kidneys. Marked compression and stretching of pelvicaliceal structures. Large echogenic and lobular kidneys. May demonstrate diffuse hypoechoic cortical thickening. Nephrogenic rests are generally cortical, hypoechoic, low attenuationand T1 hypointense.

foci of metanephric blastema beyond 36 weeks gestation
malignant transformation to Wilms
Multiple solid subcapsular mass lesions
Hypovascular - little enhancement on CT; Hypoechoic on US
Low on T1 and T2

can also be small solitary homogenous lesions- metanephric rests- can be precursor to wilms

Persistent nephrogenic rests beyond 36 weeks. Look for a &quot;rind&quot;. This can turn into Wilms so needs to be followed by ultrasound

title: "Contrast resolution depends on what?"

&quot;kVp &amp; Collimation&quot;

Low kVp = high contrast Because more photoelectric effect

Collimation, smaller FOV, grid = REDUCE SCATTER --&gt; and thus improve contrast

Misc: 
- More bits = more contrast
- Narrow window width = INCREASES contrast (BRAIN WINDOW)
- LUT (look up table) in digital

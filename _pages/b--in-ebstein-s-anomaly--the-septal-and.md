title: "B. In Ebstein's anomaly, the septal and posterior leaflets of the tricuspid valve (arrows) are displaced apically resulting in atrialization of the base of the right ventricle. The tricuspid annulus, however, is normally positioned between the right atrium and ventricle. The atrialized portion of the RV is thinned and prone to aneurysmal dilation.  There is no connection between the two sides of the heart that would suggest a ASD or VSD. None of the findings of Tetralogy of Fallot are present. The pulmonic valve and aortic arch are not visualized in this slice."

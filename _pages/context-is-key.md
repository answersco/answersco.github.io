title: "CONTEXT IS KEY"
---
-Bruises/pressure sores/fractures are each caused by the same thing (EX. Bruises = ruptured blood vessel which extravasates into surrounding tissue)

-Our job is to find out WHY these signs/injuries happened

-Context is key 

-Some are obvious and no context is needed (obvious bruises, cigarette burns, etc)

title: "Lemon sign and banana sign:"
---
Lemon sign: appearance of indented frontal bone
Classically Chiari II, though also in 90% of spina bifida cases
Typically seen before 24 weeks, and disappears after 24 weeks

Banana sign: cerebellum wraps around the brainstem as a result of cord tethering (and downward migration of posterior fossa), looking like a banana. It obliterates the cisterna magna.
Seen with Chiari II and spina bifida (which also has small BPD and enlarged ventricles).

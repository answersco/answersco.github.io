title: "MDGs vs. SDGs"
---
-First, the SDGs encompass specific targets for each goal. In total for the 17 SDGs there are 169 targets and these are not just for low resource countries to aim for, but they are goals for all of us. 
-In fact, the SDGs move beyond a global approach to a planetary approach. 
-They are a whole-person approach to confront and deal with problems that threaten the planet.
-MDGs were considered to be more limited in scope and something for other countries to achieve, which did not include the U.S. and other high resource countries

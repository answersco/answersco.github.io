Nonaneurysmal perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage is clinically benign subarachnoid hemorrhage confined to perimesencephalic and prepontine cisterns. NECT is very sensitive and shows hyperdense CSF in the prepontine and perimesencephalic cisterns. Although FLAIR sequence can show hyperintense CSF due to subarachnoid hemorrhage, it is often limited by CSF pulsation artifact.

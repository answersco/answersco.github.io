Power and sample size
&#946;: the probability of making a Type II error (defined as failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false)
Power: defined as (1-&#946;) &#8594; power is the probability of avoiding a Type II error
In planning a study, researchers typically need to determine the sample size necessary to provide a desired power level.
Required sample size depends on the ratio between SD and the smallest meaningful difference (effect size).
Decreasing the SD (e.g. by using more precise measurement techniques or using a more homogeneous patient population) or increasing the effect size are ways to decrease the sample size.

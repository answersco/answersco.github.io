Astrocytoma

Astrocytoma&#8594; most common intramedullary tumor in children; usually low-grade.
Usually extends over several vertebral levels and causes fusiform dilation of spinal cord.
Cystic components are seen in ~ &#8531;, and syrinx may be present.
Tumors almost always enhance.
Hemorrhage is rare (unlike ependymoma)
Cannot be reliably differentiated from ependymoma based on imaging features, though hemorrhage (usually ependymoma) may be a helpful discriminating feature.

Astrocytoma: most common intramedullary tumor in children&#8594; favors cervical and upper thoracic cord
Fusiform dilation of cord over multiple segments
Dark on T1, bright on T2, and enhance
+/- rostral or caudal cysts
-Often eccentric

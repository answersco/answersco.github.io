Cognitive (interpretive) errors

Perceptual errors: far more common, accounting for 60-80%
Occur during the initial detection phase of image interpretation
Deemed to have occurred when an abnormality is determined to have been present in retrospect on a diagnostic image but was not seen by the interpreting radiologist at the time
Increased incidence of perceptual error may be attributable to certain risk factors, including poor lesion conspicuity, reader fatigue, overly rapid pace of performing interpretations, distracting phone calls, and &quot;satisfaction of search.&quot;
Most are without obvious cause.

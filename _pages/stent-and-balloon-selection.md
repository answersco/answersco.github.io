title: "Stent and balloon selection"
---
Balloon: should be 10-20% larger than the vessel diameter
-Patient should be anticoagulated, and will need 1-3 months of ASA and/or plavix.

Primary stenting = angioplasty, then stent placement
-Stent should be 1-2 cm longer than the stenosis, and 1-2 mm wider than the normal vessel lumen.
-Self-expandable: good for areas that might get 
compressed (superficial locations like cervical carotid or SFA)
-Balloon-expandable: for more precise deployment (e.g. renal ostium).
-Closed cell: each stent segment connected by a link- less flexible, but better radial force.
-Open-cell: some segment connections are absent- flexible, conforming to tortuous vessels, but less radial force.
-Nitinol (used with self-expanding stents): has &quot;thermal memory&quot; - soft at room temperature, but becomes more rigid at body temperature.
-Drug-eluting stents: used to combat neointimal hyperplasia.

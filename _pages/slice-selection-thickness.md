title: "Slice selection thickness"

This is going to be determined by the SLOPE (strength) of the slice select gradient
The larger the gradient the NARROWER the slice (because there are larger differences in frequency)
The smaller the gradient the THICKER the slices (because adjacent protons are going to be very close in frequency)

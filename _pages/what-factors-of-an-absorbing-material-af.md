title: "What factors of an absorbing material affect absorbed dose?"
---
Absorbed dose (measured in gray or rad): depends on physical parameters such as density and average atomic #
Materials with low atomic # such as fat will absorb less radiation dose than materials with higher atomic #, such as bone.
For some materials, &#8593; x-ray beam energy can &#8595; the absorbed dose, as more x-rays penetrate the material without being absorbed.

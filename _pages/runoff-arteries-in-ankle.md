title: "Runoff arteries in ankle"
---
The AT and PT arteries continue into the foot in 95%, while the peroneal artery terminates above the ankle in 95%.
-5%: one of the runoff vessels is absent (if the AT or PT is congenitally absent in the calf, the peroneal artery may instead continue into the foot).

title: "Imaging of struma ovarii?"
---
mature cystic teratoma that is entirely or predominantly made of thyroid tissue. 

It usually presents as a multilocular cystic mass where the cysts are filled with colloid. The solid component usually shows high attenuation on precontrast images reflecting its high iodine contents.

* CAN CONTAIN FAT (and helps distinguish from serous cystadenocarcinoma!)

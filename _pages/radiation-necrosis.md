title: "Radiation necrosis"
---
Indistinguishable from recurrent tumor on conventional imaging. May demonstrate mass effect and enhancement. Radiation necrosis may have elevated lactate peak (necrosis) on MRS. Recurrent tumor may have elevated choline peak and depressed n-acetyl aspartate (NAA) peak.

Commonly occurs 6 to 24 months postradiation. Enhancing lesion with mass effect and ring enhancement. Or multiple foci of enhancement, Mimicks recurrent neoplasm. MR spectroscopy (MRS): Elevated lactate and lipids (0.9 to 1.3 ppm). Reduced other major metabolites (choline, creatine, and N-acetylaspartate).

title: "Smallwood"

case that tells us about the MENS REA for attempt under the COMMON LAW: you need PURPOSE, not knowledge); attempt requires specific intent to produce the proscribed result; can't infer intent to kill solely from exposure to risk (insufficient evidence to infer purpose); distinguish from other HIV case (Hinkhouse) in that there, the defendant engaged in active concealment, lying, saying he would spread the disease (letting us infer purpose)

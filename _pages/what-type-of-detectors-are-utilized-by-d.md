title: "What type of detectors are utilized by dose calibrators, well-counters, and Geiger-Muller counters?"
---
Dose calibrators: use Ion chamber for detection and measurement of ionizing radiation
Well counters: used to measure radioactivity in small samples (e.g. wipe test): use a sodium iodide detector for detection and measurement of ionizing radiation
Geiger-Muller counters: used for hand-held radiation surveys &#8594; use a Geiger-Muller tube (containing low-pressure inert gas) for detection and measurement of ionizing radiation.

MAG-3 Renal scan will show increasing uptake in the parenchyma (focal or diffuse) with delayed peak on BASELINE scan at 24-48 hrs post. Usually renal function will improve with improved renal scan in subsequent weeks. Acute rejection is typically later with scans at 1-2 weeks showing decreased function compared to baseline.

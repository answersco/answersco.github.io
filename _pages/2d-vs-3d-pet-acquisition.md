title: "2D vs 3D PET acquisition?"
---
The 3D mode (septa retracted) increases coincidence efficiency by about 5X in comparison to a 2D acquisition (septa extended) at the expense of increasing randoms and scattered coincidences and system dead-time. It has been shown that the maximum is reached by the NEC in 3D at a lower activity concentration than in 2D as expected from the behavior of the true coincidence rate.

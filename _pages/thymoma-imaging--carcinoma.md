title: "Thymoma imaging? Carcinoma?"

Thymoma = smooth soft tissue mass with possible necrosis or cystic change 
* Cystic mass with mural nodules
* T1 low to intermediate; T2 high (esp in the intracystic change)
* peripheral curvilinear calcification along the capsule

5th to 6th decade in life - Adults males mean age 40 yo

Does NOT often cross midline (usually one lobe of the thymus)

In a female, think of LYMPHOMA first if large anterior mediastinal mass. Females RARELY get malignant neoplasm of germ cell origin

Thymic hyperplasia has microscopic fat/intravoxel fat so it will DROP on out of phase imaging. Thymoma will NOT do that
(Both are usually T2 bright)

Malignant thymoma = MORE likely to calcify!
_________
- Thymic carcinoma = look for LAD and local invasion; calcification makes it more worrisome

Which sequence is most sensitive for detection of prostate canceR?

Desiccated discs are dark on ___

This is the time to decay to 37% of the TRANSVERSE magnetization (Which is ZERO) - i.e. you have lost 63% of transverse magnitization
T2 is SHORTER than T1 i.e. it takes less time to lose the transverse magnitization

T2 weighted = LONG T1 and LONG T2

AKA transverse relaxation or spin-spin relaxation
Defined as 63% decay (37% transverse magnetization remaining)
Long T2 -&gt; bright
Due to magnetic field inhomogeneities and spin-spin interactions
Always shorter than T1
Maximized by long TE

Tissue-spin interactions and magnetic field inhomogeneities
Always shorter than T2
Effects canceled with 180 degree refocusing at 1/2 TE (recoverable)
Higher strength magnet -&gt; larger magnetic field inhomogeneities -&gt; shorter T2*

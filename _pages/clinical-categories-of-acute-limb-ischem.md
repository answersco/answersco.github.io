title: "Clinical categories of acute limb ischemia: I and II"
---
Category I: Viable
-Not immediately threatened
-No sensory loss or muscle weakness
-+ arterial and venous Doppler signals

Category II: threatened
-A: marginally threatened- salveageable with prompt treatment.
-Minimal sensory loss (toes), no muscle weakness
-Arterial signal occasionally +, frequently -
-Venous Doppler signal +

-B: immediately threatened- salveageable with immediate treatment
-Sensory loss more than toes; rest pain
-Mild to moderate muscle weakness
-Doppler signal rarely +, usually -
-Venous Doppler signal positive

Category III = irreversibe
-Prognosis: major permanent tissue loss
-Sensory loss: anesthetic
-Muscle weakness: paralysis
-Negative arterial and venous Doppler signals.

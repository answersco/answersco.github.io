Nephrobastomatosis:
1. Persistent nephrogenic rests after 36 weeks 
2. Can be a precursor to wilms tumor
3. NOTE: when wilms is bilateral, 99% of the time the tumors started of a nephroblastomatosis
4. If you see NECROSIS, then you need to be thinking about wilms tumor
5. Imaging appearance: Reniform enlarge with HYPODENSE RIND, enhances less than normal renal parynchyma 
6. Follow up: you need to screen with ultrasound q3 months until age 7-8

Mesoblastic nephroma
1. Fetal hamartoma, generally benign
2. 80% diagnosed w/n first month of life
3. These things look pretty aggro but they are generally benign

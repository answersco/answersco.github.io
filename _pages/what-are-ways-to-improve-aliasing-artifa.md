title: "What are ways to improve aliasing artifact in US?"
---
Answer: using a lower frequency probe or imaging the vessel in a different location where it is closer to the US transducer.
Since the size of the Doppler shift is proportional to the fundamental imaging frequency, using a lower frequency probe will result in a relatively smaller Doppler shift, which will decrease aliasing.
Reducing the distance between the US probe and the vessel allows for higher pulse repetition frequencies, which will also reduce aliasing.
Unlike color Doppler, power Doppler is not affected by aliasing artifacts.

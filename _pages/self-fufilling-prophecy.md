title: "Self-fufilling prophecy"

expectations cause individuals to act in way that make the expectations come true
EX. people in Akron are known to argue so when someone approaches a person from Akron they will act defensive and argue about something with the person which causes them to argue back their opinion and they go &quot;See, I told you people from Akron like to argue!&quot;

CT Window Width and Level
Level = midpoint of the gray-scale display
Want level at the attenuation of your target (e.g. for bone, high level)

Width: selected based on what you are comparing
For things with very different densities, you want a wide width
For similar densities (e.g. white and gray matter), you want a narrow window width
Things above the upper width level will be solid white, and below lower level will be solid black.

---
* T1 Hetero hypo mass
* T2 Hyper periphery (cellular tumor) + large central hypo (fibrosis). Hyper central foci may represent necrosis, mucin
* Progressive, gradual, and concentric filling (centripetal) on delayed-phase images
* Substantial delayed enhancement &gt; liver parenchyma in 74% of PCC, attributed to fibrous stroma.
*Capsular retraction (frequent), with parenchymal atrophy of liver segments peripheral to tumor.
* Upstream biliary dilatation
* Not isodense to vessels (unlike hemangioma)

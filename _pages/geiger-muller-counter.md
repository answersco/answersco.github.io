title: "Geiger Muller counter"
---
Used to detect small amounts of radioactive contamination
Very sensitive
Great for low-level radioactive survey
Terrible for very high radiation fields (dead time)

Has a gas-filled chamber.
Dead time: vulnerable to being overloaded by a large dose of radiation. With dead time, the ionization must dissipate before it can respond again.
Max dose it can handle is about 100 mR/h

Discoid meniscus: involves lateral &gt; medial meniscus
To make the dx, the bow-tie appearance should be present on at least 3 consecutive images, assucming 5mm thick sagittal sections.

Coronal images: dx made if the meniscus, from the free edge margin to the periphery of the body of the meniscus measures &gt; 1.4 cm.

May be the source of pain or locking even in the absence of a tear (which is still more likely to occur).

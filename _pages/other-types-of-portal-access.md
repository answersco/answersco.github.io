Transvenous: via cannula introduced into a hepatic vein from the jugular vein (TIPS).

Splenoportography: portal system opacified by inserting a needle into splenic pulp and injecting iodinated contrast or CO2. 
-Rarely used for diagnostic imaging, but useful alternative approach for splenic vein interventions.

Retrograde catheterization of a recanalized umbilical vein allows access to the left portal vein.

Arterioportography: indirect opacification of portal venous system by injection of SMA and/or IMA, resulting in opacification of the mesenteric tributatry veins and portal vein as contrast drains from splanchnic capillary bed.
-Rate and density of opacification after SMA/IMA injection improved by injecting NG.
-SMA 5-8 mL/sec and IMA 2-4 mL/sec for 6-10 sec with rapid filming (&gt;/=4 frames/sec) for a few seconds followed by 1 frame/sec in venous phase.
-Injection of celiac artery opacifies PV with blood draining from spleen, stomach, and pancreas.
-Injection of splenic artery

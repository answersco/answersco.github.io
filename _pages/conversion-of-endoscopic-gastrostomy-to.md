Most PEG tubes have inner bumpers designed to hold tube in place.
-Usually not possible to pull these bumpers through the perc tract. 
-Options: leave PEG tube in situ and place a new tube with a new tract, or cut PEG tube at skin and allow inner bumper to fall into stomach. Downside to this is rare development of GI obstruction.

Often the perc tract of PEG tubes is angled toward the fundus, making it difficult to redirect the tract toward the antrum.
-Use of a large 15-16-Fr peel-away sheath and dilator is helpful at angling the wire toward the antrum. 
-The dilator is then removed, leaving peel-away and guidewire in the antrum.
-Kumpe catheter and glidewire then used to negotiate the pyloric canal.
-Subsequent steps then follow those of perc G-J

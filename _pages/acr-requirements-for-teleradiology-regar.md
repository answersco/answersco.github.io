title: "ACR requirements for teleradiology regarding the transmission and review of images/patient data"
---
New technology systems should include the ACR/NEMA data format standard and the DICOM network standard.
Display: ACR requires that the luminance of grayscale monitors should be at least 50 foot-lamberts (170 cd/m2)
For large matrix displays: ACR requires interactive windowing, magnification, inversion and rotation functions, and the capability of making accurate linear measurements.
For small matrix systems: ACR requires accurate reproduction of the original study.

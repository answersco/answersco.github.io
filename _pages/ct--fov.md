title: "CT: FOV"
---
Scanned field of view (SFOV) usually 50-55 cm in diameter
Matrix size of 512 x 512 is usually held constant
Pixel size = FOV / matrix size
Typically ~0.6 mm (versus 0.2 mm in CXR)
Each pixel is normally represented by 12 bits, or 4096 gray levels
Voxel volume = pixel area x slice thickness

PET/CT
This is where there is a mismatch between the PET field of view (FOV) and the CT FOV
Lesions at the margin will be affected in the below way:
1. Part of lesion in the CT FOV AND PET FOV will appear too HOT
2. Part of lesion OUT of the CT FOC but IN the PET FOV will appear too COLD (because there is no attenuation correction)

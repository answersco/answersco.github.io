Perfusion: Tc-99m-MAA most common
-Half life around 4 hours
-Normal perfusion excludes PE

Ventilation: xenon-133 (gas) or Tc-99m-DTPA (aerosol)
-Xe-133: physical half life 5.3 days, biologic half-life 30 seconds. 
-Low energy (80 keV): MUST DO THIS PART OF TEST 1ST
-Can only do one view (usually posterior, due to short half-life) with a single detector (dual detector can do anterior and posterior)
-3 phases: wash in (single max inspiration &amp; breath-hold), equilibrium, and wash-out.
-Activity homogeneous in the lungs

Tc-99m-DTPA: requires patient cooperation
-Also must be performed first.
-Multiple projections (slower wash-out_
-Clumping common in mouth, central airways, and stomach.

title: "Converging hole versus diverging collimator"
---
Converging hole collimator (cone beam): holes are close together on the object side and far apart on the crystal side
-Magnifies WITHOUT inverting the image

Diverging collimator: opposite of converging, with holes far apart on the object side, and close together on the camera side.
-Takes a large object and minimizes it- results in image of a large part of the body on a small crystal.
-Increased area, decreased sensitivity and resolution.

title: "Congenital anomalies of SVC:"
---
Normally the embryologic left anterior cardinal vein regresses and the right anterior cardinal vein develops into the SVC
Left-sided SVC: due to persistence of the embryological left anterior cardinal vein and regression of the right anterior cardinal vein.
Left SVC: usually drains into the coronary sinus &#8594; right atrium
Rarely the left SVC drains directly into the left atrium, causing a right-to-left shunt.
Weakly associated with congenital heart disease (CHD)
Duplicated SVC: due to persistence of both the left and right anterior cardinal veins.
Associated with CHD.

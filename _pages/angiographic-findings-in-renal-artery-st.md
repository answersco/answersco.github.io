title: "Angiographic findings in renal artery stenosis"
---
Renal artery stenosis suggested by the degree of luminal narrowing (50-75%), post-stenotic dilatation, slow flow distal to the lesion, presence of collateral circulation, and decreased renal mass
Delayed filming may be necessary to visualize a reconstituted artery distal to a proximal occlusion.

Mean systolic pressure gradient &gt; 10 mmHg or peak systolic gradient &gt; 20 mmHg between Ao and renal artery distal to the lesion is suggestive of a hemodynamically significant stenosis.
-Generally the larger the gradient, the more confident that one can be that treating the stenosis will benefit the patient.

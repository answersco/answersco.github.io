1. TCC = most commonly in the bladder; most common subtype in the bladder is &quot;superficial papillary&quot;

2. Squamous cell = Schistosomiasis (heavily calcified bladder and distal ureters)

3. AdenoCa of bladder = URACHAL (midline at bladder dome)

4. Rhabdomyosarcoma = &lt; 10 yo; often infiltrative with paratesticular mass; mets can go to lungs/bones/Lns
- Botryoid variant produces a polypoid mass (looks like bunch of grapes)

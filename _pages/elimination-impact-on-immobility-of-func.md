title: "Elimination impact on immobility of function"
---
1) urinary stasis: bodies are designed to be upright so when laying down, it makes it harder for the fluid to reach the bladder bc it creates a kind of equilibrium (think of a water bottle upright and on its side) 
2) urinary tract infection: can be caused by urinary stasis 
3) renal calculi: can be caused by urinary stasis and lack of mobility, increased bone breakdown releasing calcium into the blood stream 
4) constipation: nervous system signals to the GI tract to slow down as well bc the whole body systems are slowing down when not in use

title: "What is hydrocephalus?"
---
Hydrocephalus is an active expansion of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume at the expense of the brain tissue (excluding atrophy or ventriculomegaly in congenital maldevelopment). Hydrocephalus is a common 2ndary complication of any disorder that results in abnormal kinetics of the CSF. It is also a disease by itself with a specific natural history and deterioration of brain function if untreated.

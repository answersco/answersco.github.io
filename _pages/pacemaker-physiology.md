-SA node does not have a stable resting membrane potential
-RMP is about -60 mV but steadily depolarizes
-At threshold, Na+ and Ca2+ channels open
-peak around 0 mV
-K+ repolarization, reset, start over
-slow, upward drift from leaky Na+ flow
-when SA node fires it sets off heartbeat in about .8 seconds

gun-bump A&amp;A case that tells us about ACT and INTENT; he A&amp;A the drug sale, but did he A&amp;A the ARMED part? No, need TRUE PURPOSE for the entire offense; we can infer true purpose via advance knowledge (giving a realistic opportunity to back out once he found out his friend had a gun); act requirement = just ONE component of the crime

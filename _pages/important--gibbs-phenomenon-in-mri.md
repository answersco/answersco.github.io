title: "IMPORTANT: Gibbs phenomenon in MRI?"
---
Gibbs phenomenon, also known as ringing atria
ct, has the appearance of multiple,
regularly spaced bands that are parallel to one another. They typically present as alternating
bright and dark signal bands that slowly fade as the distance from the source of the artifact
increases. 
* They often occur at sharp boundaries, which have high contrast transitions in the
image. This artifact is caused by insufficient sampling of high frequencies, which may occur at sharp discontinuities in signal.

Classically where? CSF-cord interface or skull-brain

Improve: Increased # phase encoding steps, bigger matrix, smaller pixel, or decrease receiver bandwidth (longer sampling time to get those high frequencies) --&gt; decreased SNR (due to voxel) and longer scan time

title: "Expanding repeats"
---
-insertion of triplet repeats leads to extra amino acids
-some genes are particularly prone to expansion of repeats
-number of repeats correlates with age of onset and severity of phenotype
-expect the expansion of the triplet repeat and an increase in severity of phenotype in subsequent generations -- gets worse with every generation

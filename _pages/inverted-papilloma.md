Benign epithelial tumor of the sinus mucosa. Remodels bone.

centered in the sinus cavity
cerebreform enhancement.
remoddels bone, instead of eroding bone. 
may degenerate into or coexist with SCCA

Inverted papilloma&#8594; benign, lobulated epithelial tumor of the sinus mucosa
10-20% associated with SCC.
Classic finding on enhanced study of cerebriform pattern of enhancement&#8594; curvilinear, gyriform pattern.
In contrast to a mucocele or obstructed secretions, the entire solid tumor will enhance.
Tumor tends to remodel bone.
15% recurrence after resection.

Typically going to be located along the lateral nasal wall (most likely to involve the middle turbinate)
10% of these guys harbor squamous cell carcinoma
There can be a focal periosteal reaction at the site of the tumor along its wall
You can see cerebriform pattern on MRI

Lateral wall of nasal cavity with &quot;cerebriform&quot; pattern. 10% harbor squamous cell CA!

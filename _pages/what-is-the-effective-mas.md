title: "What is the effective mAs?"
---
mAs/pitch is used in helical CT scanning. As the pitch increases with all other settings remaining constant, the number of x-ray photons contributing to the slice data will decrease (effective mAs). The effective mAs determines the dose to the slice (CTDIvol) and signal to noise.

title: "Types of anatomic popliteal entrapment syndrome"
---
I: medial deviation of pop artery around normal medial insertion of gastrocs muscle

II: aberrant lateral insertion of medial head of gastrocs causing medial deviation of pop 

III: aberrant lateral slips of medial gastrocs entrap normally-situated pop artery

IV: popliteus muscle or fibrous band entraps pop artery; artery may also pass medial to medial head of gastrocs in some cases

V: entrapment of both popliteal artery and vein by medial head of gastrocs

title: "Alvarez"
---
conspiracy case that serves as a limit to Pinkerton liability; significance of your role in the conspiracy (could be a limit b/c it's not ALL co-conspirators, depends on how major/minor your role is); issues of notice and knowledge (how much you knew about the conspiracy); constrains Pinkerton doctrine to those with MORE than minor roles + those w/ actual knowledge of reasonably foreseeable consequences

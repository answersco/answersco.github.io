title: "Ancient water control systems"

These systems emerged during the ancient time because most early civilization grew around river valleys. Flood control systems helped prevent disastrous river flooding, while irrigation sustems aided crop cultivation and thus contributed to population growth. The construction of such widespread projects encouraged the development of concentrated population centers, including the first cities.

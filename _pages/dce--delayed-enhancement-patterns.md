title: "DCE: delayed enhancement patterns"
---
Delayed &#8594; persistent (type I), plateau (type II), and washout (type III)
Type I (persistent) &#8594; continuously increasing (&gt; 10%) enhancement in the delayed phase.
83% are benign, up to 9% malignant
Type II (plateau) &#8594; early rise in enhancement, but levels off (within 10%) in the delayed phase.
Suspicious, but less so than Type III curve.
PPV ~ 64-77%
Type III (washout) &#8594; has a &gt; 10% &#8595; in signal intensity in the delayed phase
Suspicious for malignancy&#8594; PPV of 87-92%, but only seen in 21% of malignant lesions.

Morphology trumps kinetics in evaluation of a lesion (e.g. lesions that looks like classic LN with type III kinetics should not be biopsied).

title: "Toscano"
---
case showing NJ's change to common-law duress, getting rid of the imminence requirement (that the act was committed in response to a threat of present, imminent, and impending death/serious bodily harm); immediacy element allows potential for injustice; changes it (looks more like MPC now); looking to see whether defendant's conduct was that of &quot;a person of reasonable firmness in his situation&quot;

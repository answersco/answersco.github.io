title: "LE angiography: proximal imaging"
---
Angio eval of LEs should include, at a minimum, the aortic bifurcation to the ankle
-Abdominal aortogram with a pigtail or other high-flow nonselective catheter is performed before imaging the LEs, particularly when renovascular or visceral artery occlusive disease is suspected. Catheter should be positioned with sideholes in the visceral segment when the celiac and SMA are to be included.
-Pelvic arteriography- performed with same catheter just proximal to aortic bifurcation. AP and bilateral oblique views should be obtained whenever iliac artery pathology is suspected.
-Typical pelvic angio parameters: 8-10 mL/sec for 2-3 seconds, with imaging at 2-4/sec.
-Pressure gradients should be obtained across any suspicious stenosis.

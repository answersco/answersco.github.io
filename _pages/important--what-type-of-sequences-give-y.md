title: "IMPORTANT: What type of sequences give you a Type II chemical shift artifact?"
---
GRE only (Spin echo gets rid of india ink/ out of phase phenomenon with its refocusing pulse)

However, regular type I chemical shift in freq encoding direction is present in both GRE and spin echo

The refocusing pulse in a spin-echo sequence corrects for chemical shift artifact of the 2nd kind (in- and out-of-phase phenomenon) but not for chemical shift artifact of the 1st kind (spatial misregistration in frequency encoding direction).

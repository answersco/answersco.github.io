title: "Magnification views"
---
When doing magnification views you get a CC and a TRUE lateral (ML)
- Reason for the true lateral is to be able to catch milk of calcium

How to decide if you should use a ML or an LM
Think about always trying to get the lesion closer to the receptor
Trick: if you see the lesion LATERALLY on your cc then get the ML, If you see the lesion MEDIALLY on your cc then get the LM
If you see the lesion on the MLO then get the ML (because most breast cancers are in the LATERAL aspect)

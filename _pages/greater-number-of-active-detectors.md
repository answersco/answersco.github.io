title: "* Greater number of active detectors =   *Increased total beam width =   *Penumbra of the beam outside the detectors is a SMALLER fraction of the total pt volume exposed to xrays  ***** LESS WASTED DOSE =   ********More Efficient"

Greater number of ACTIVE DETECTORS would have what effect on GEOMETRIC EFFICIENCY ?

Vignetting artifact: edges look darker than the center
Because distances from the focusing point to the outer phosphor tend to vary, with the closest path in the center and the farthest path at the edge &#8594; can get dark periphery and light center

Vignetting artifact: edges look darker than the center

Edges are darker than center

Because distances from the focusing point to the outer phosphor tend to vary, with the closest path in the center and the farthest path at the edge &#8594; can get dark periphery and light center

This is associated with fluroscopy units that are attached to a display
The CENTER of the image will appear brighter than the periphery

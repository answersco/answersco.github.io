title: "Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HSP):"
---
Acute HSP: characterized by inflammatory exudate filling the alveoli, which manifests on imaging as nonspecific GGO or consolidation.
Small, ill-defined centrilobular nodules may also be present
Subacute HSP: hallmark is centrilobular ground-glass nodules
Mosaic attenuation (geographic areas of lucency) and GGO may also be seen
Mosaic attenuation secondary to mosaic perfusion on inspiration and air-trapping on expiration.
Abnormalities of subacute HSP involve the entire axial cross-section of lung.
Head-cheese sign: describes the combination of patchy ground-glass and areas of lucency due to mosaic perfusion or air-trapping.
Chronic HSP: from long-term exposure to the offending antigen
Leads to upper-lobe predominant pulmonary fibrosis
Often the findings of subacute disease (including centrilobular nodules, ground-glass, and mosaic attenuation) may be superimposed
Unlike IPF, honeycombing is not common in HSP&#8594; when present, it may involve the upper lobes. If there is relative sparing of the bases, chronic HSP is much more likely than IPF.

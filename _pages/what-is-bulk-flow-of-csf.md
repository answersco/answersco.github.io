title: "What is bulk flow of CSF?"
---
The overall flow from secretion to absorption and is approx 500mL/day and follow the pressure gradient from arterial pressure to venous pressure. 60% of CSF is produced by the choroid plexus and 60% is absorbed by the periphery. Obstructive hydrocephalus impedes bulk flow.

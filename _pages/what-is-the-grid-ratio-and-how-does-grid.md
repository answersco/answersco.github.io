title: "What is the grid ratio and how does grid ratio relate to dose?"
---
The grid ratio is the height of the septa to the distance of the septa. Higher grid ratios mean decreased scatter but also higher radiation dose (more radiation needed to get the same exposure at the detector). It is calculated by multiplying the equivalent dose imparted on that tissue with the tissue weighting factor of this organ (ICRP publication 103). It allows estimation of risk of stochastic effects in a large population.

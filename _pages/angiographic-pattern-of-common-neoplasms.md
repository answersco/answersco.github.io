title: "Angiographic pattern of common neoplasms: LIVER"
---
HCC: hypervascular, bizarre neovascularity, arterioportal sunting, portal vein occlusion

FNH: hypervascular, central scar, spoke-wheel appearance, not bizarre like HCC

Adenoma: hypervascular, diffuse inhomogeneous staining, not as bizarre as HCC

Cavernous hemangioma: focal (2-5mm hyperdense, sharply marginated punctate staining appearing in mid-capillary phase and persisting through late venous phase. Angiography is pathognomonic

Metastases: multiple round lesions of different sizes:
Hypervascular: carcinoid, islet cell adenocarcinoma, thyroid, renal, leiomyosarcoma, melanoma.
Hypovascular: GI adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, lung (usually), breast.

RCC: usually extremely hypervascular with multiple abnormal vascular channels. Frequent arteriovenous shunting. Papillary subtype is hypovascular

Oncocytoma: hypervascular, occasionally with spoke-wheel appearance. Cannot be reliably differentiated from RCC

AML: hypervascular, often with microaneurysms. Cannot be reliably differentiated from RCC angiographically. CT shows fat.

Adenocarcinoma: hypovascular, encasing both arteries and veins

Islet cell tumors: often hypervascular, may be occult

Cystadenocarcinoma: hypervascular with dense blush

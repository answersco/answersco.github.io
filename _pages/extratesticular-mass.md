Paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma: Most common malignant extratesticular mass in young men. If you see a MASS within the scrotum not arising from the testes without a trauma history THINK paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma. I think these arise from the epididymis or spermatic cord. 

This **** boy may also be called an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma

title: "Pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm and tx"
---
True aneurysms of the pancreaticoduodenal arteries are rare lesions associated with celiac artery or SMA occlusive disease and increased collateral flow in the peripancreatic arcade.

Selective embo with placement of coils on both sides of the aneurysm can be life-saving. There are usually sufficient collaterals to preserve adequate flow between the SMA and celiac artery.

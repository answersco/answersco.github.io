title: "Engel's six stages of grief"
---
1. Shock and disbelief
2. Developing Awareness - experience physical and emotional responses
3. Restitution - do we have a wake, do we have a burial, do we have a funeral, the rituals we do to mark the passing
4. Resolving the Loss - dealing with the reality of the void in your life, practical and emotional
5. Idealization - not focusing on the negative effects or attributes about them but focus on the positive
6. Outcome - dealing with the loss as a normal life occurrence, you have moved through it and now have a new reality but without completely dismissing and ignoring the loss

title: "What is the characteristic finding of scleroderma in the distal phalanges? Is this finding specific to scleroderma?"
---
Acroosteolysis - this is resorption of the DISTAL PORTION of the distal phalanges

It is not specific however to scleroderma; may also be caused by:

1) collagen vascular disease (includes scleroderma)

2) neuropathy

3) polyvinyl chloride (PVC) exposure

4) thermal injury (burn or frostbite)

5) hyperparathyroidism

6) Hajdu-Cheney - a rare autosomal dominant syndrome in which there is short stature, craniofacial changes and progressive acroosteolysis

title: "Equivalent Dose?"
---
Term defined to normalize the absorbed energy relative to the type of radiation that is exposing the tissue. The Equivalent Dose is determined by multiplying the absorbed dose by a radiation type weighting factor. Units Gy (J/kg).

Equivalent dose = Wr x Dose in sievert (Sv), which uses units of joule/kg (like Gray)
Wr = radiation weighting factor&#8594; 1 for common radiations (x-rays, gamma rays, and electrons) used in diagnostic imaging.

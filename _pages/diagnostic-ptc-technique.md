title: "Diagnostic PTC technique"
---
Diagnostic PTC performed predominantly from right side
-Patient asked to take a deep breath under fluoro, and the position of maximal lung descent is marked. Point of needle access chosen 1-2 interspaces below this point in the mid-axillary line.
-22-g Chiba needle (15 cm) is inserted under fluoro from the right flank toward the T12 vertebral body. It is inserted parallel to tabletop in one smooth motion.
-Stylet withdrawn and small aliquots of CM are injected every 1-2 mm until a bile duct is entered.
-If a bile duct isn't entered on the first pass, successive passes are made in a fan shape down through the liver toward the biliary hilum, taking care not to withdraw the needle fully outside the liver capsule.
-When bile duct is entered, contrast is injected via extension tube.
-With low bile duct obstructions, it is helpful to tilt the table.
-Images obtained in AP and both oblique positions.

title: "Plethysmography: evaluation"
---
The plethy waveform can be analyzed for both contour and amplitude.
-The contour of the waveform is determined by the status of arterial blood supply.
-As the degree of stenosis becomes more severe, the dicrotic notch is lost and the overall slope is flattened.
-The amplitude of the waveform reflects underlying muscle mass. Fat and bone are relatively avascular, contributing little to the change in volume during the cardiac cycle. This accounts for why the amplitude increases slightly at the calf in normal patients owing to lower amount of adipose tissue.

Photoplethysmography can be used in the evaluation of vasospastic disorders by testing before and after temperature stimuli.

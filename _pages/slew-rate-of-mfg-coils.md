title: "Slew-rate of MFG coils:"
---
The current in the MFG coils cannot be turned on or off instantaneously.
The slew-rate = the maximum rate of current increase in the MFG coil = maximum gradient strength / gradient rise time
Given in T/m per second, or T/sm
Industry standard rise time (time required to increase current from zero to the maximum value) = 1 ms
Danger of using very high slew rates&#8594; potential for inducing peripheral nerve stimulation in the patient.

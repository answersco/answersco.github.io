title: "Use of spin-echo and GRE in cardiac MRI"
---
Spin-Echo: typically dark-blood
Relatively little artifact from metal
Longer acquisition times than GRE
Used to obtain high-resolution images to study anatomy 
Each image requires a single breath hold

GRE: typically bright blood &#8594; work-horse of cardiac imaging due to speed/versatility
More susceptible to metal-induced artifacts
Faster imaging speeds
Used in assessment of ventricular function, blood velocity and flow measurements, assessment of valvular disease, myocardial perfusion, delayed enhancement imaging, and MRA.

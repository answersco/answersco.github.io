title: "How antibody works"
---
-attaches to surface of pathogen due to antibodies specificity for antigen
-pathogen surface becomes coated with antibody
-antibody on pathogen surfaces then causes:
1) opsonization
2) activation of complement system (fixation)
3) agglutination (antibodies clump together)
4) neutralization of viruses (antibody binds to a virus then virus can't attach to the host cell) 
5) precipitation of cell free molecules (e.g., toxins): antibodies stick to toxins

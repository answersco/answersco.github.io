- eval dopamine transporters in Parkinsons
-ioflupane iodine-123 injection (DaTscan), a contrast agent for use with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for detecting dopamine transporters (DaT) in suspected parkinsonian syndromes.

The agent is indicated for striatal DaT visualization to help differentiate essential tremor from tremor due to parkinsonian syndromes, including idiopathic Parkinson's disease, multiple-system atrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy, as an adjunct to other diagnostic modalities.

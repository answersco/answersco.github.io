title: "What is the most important portion of the renal scan with regards to differential function? - how is this portion performed - how do you want the slope to look during this portion?"
---
Cortical (parenchymal) portion
- area of interest drawn around the kidneys and a background area of interest (to correct for background)
- want to measure at a time when the kidney is really drinking, but not in the collecting system yet

- want a steep slope (shows kidney is taking up the tracer appropriately)

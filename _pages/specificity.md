title: "Specificity:"

Specificity: proportion of people who don't have the disease and test negative for it
Sp = TN / (TN + FP) [TN + FP = total # of disease negatives]
Test with high specificity is most useful for ruling in disease (SPIN) &#8594; positive result indicates high likelihood of having the disease
Good confirmatory tests have high specificity
Test with high specificity have low Type I error rates

TN/TN+FP

Specificity = TN/TN + FP
This is how good a test is at determining who is disease free
Highly specific test rule disease IN &quot;SPIN&quot; i.e. if the test is positive then you HAVE the disease. Think about a BIOPSY.

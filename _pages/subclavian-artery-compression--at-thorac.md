title: "Subclavian artery compression (at thoracic outlet):"
---
Subclavian artery compression: presents with finger or hand pain, numbness, paresthesias, coolness, or Raynaud phenomenon, with symptoms worsening upon arm abduction.
Adson's maneuver: test for subclavian artery compression at the thoracic outlet.
Radial artery palpated in neutral position
Then patient's head is turned to contralateral side during inhalation&#8594; radial pulse will be &#8595; in arterial TOS.
Mechanical compression is almost always present: 70% due to cervical rib
Other causes include accessory scalene muscle (scalenus minimus), enlargement of the anterior scalene muscle, and well-developed musculature.
Potential complications: arterial mural thrombus, aneurysm, and distal embolization (hands should be evaluated).
Preferred treatment: surgical thoracic outlet decompression (e.g. resection of cervical rib) and repair of the subclavian artery if aneurysm is present.
Endovascular arterial thrombolysis may be performed adjunctively, weighed against risk of distal embolization.

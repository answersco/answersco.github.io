title: "Dose effect on noise"

Remember, the arch nemesis of quantum mottle is MORE PHOTONS
If you want to decrease quantum mottle (which would in turn decrease noise), then you can INCREASE the mAs (this is much better than increasing the kVp)
Although increasing the kVp would probs decrease quantum noise, it would DECREASE contrast and would probably lead to more compton scatter (AGAIN remember when we are talking about the KeV of a photon, we are referring to the AVERAGE energy)

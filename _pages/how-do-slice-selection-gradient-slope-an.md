title: "How do slice selection gradient slope and transmit bandwidth affect slice thickness in MRI?"
---
Greater / steeper SS gradient slope = thinner slice

Thicker transmit bandwidth = THICKER slice

(*Slice thickeness is proportional to transmit bandwidth and inversely proportional to the slice selection gradient slope)

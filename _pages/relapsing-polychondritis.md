SPARES THE POSTERIOR TRACHEAL MEMBRANE
Diffuse tracheal thickening
No calcifications

Recurrent episodes of cartilage inflammation (ear, nose) and recurrent PNA

Systemic autoimmune disorder. Affects cartilage of earlobes, nose, larynx, tracheobronchial tree, joints, and large elastic arteries. Diffuse smooth wall thickening of the wall of trachea and central bronchi with luminal narrowing.

Destruction of cartilage throughout body
* diffuse narrowing and thickening of wall; does NOT spare posterior membrane

Relapsing polychondritis &#8594; usually middle-aged women
Multisystemic disease of unknown etiology characterized by recurrent inflammation of cartilaginous structures (nose, ears, joints, larynx, trachea, bronchi) &#8594; 50% with airway involvement, most commonly larynx and subglottic trachea
CT&#8594; smooth tracheal/bronchial wall thickening
Sparing of the posterior membranous trachea (no cartilage)
Often &#8593; attenuation of airway wall, ranging from subtly &#8593; attenuation to frank calcification.

- Spares the posterior membrane
- DIFFUSE thickening
- NO calcifications
- Increased airway wall attenuation

Characterized by relapse and remitting episodes of cartilage inflammation and pneumonia

DIFFUSE thickening sparing posterior membrane, no calcs. Hx = recurrent episodes of cartilage inflammation and recurrent pneumonia

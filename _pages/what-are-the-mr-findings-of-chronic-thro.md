title: "What are the MR findings of chronic thrombus?"
---
On GRE sequences the thrombus is low signal intensity relative to myocardium due to the paramagnetic effects from deoxy and methemoglobin. Thrombi do NOT enhance, except minor enhancement of chronic fibrosis on delayed images.

Acute thrombus demonstrated hight T2 signal on spin echo sequences. Tumors typically demonstrate high signal relative to myocardium, unless they contain hemorrhage (i.e. myxoma).

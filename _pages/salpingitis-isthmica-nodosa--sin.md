title: "Salpingitis isthmica nodosa (SIN)"
---
nodular scarring of the fallopian tubes. the prevailing theories include an inflammatory (salpingitis), a congenital, and more recently an acquired (but not post-inflammatory) aetiology.
It can involve the entire fallopian tube, but usually involves the proximal two third of the fallopian tube.

An accurate radiographic diagnosis is important due to its strong association with infertility and ectopic pregnancy.

Hysterosalpingography - HSG
A characteristic finding is multiple nodular diverticular spaces involving the fallopian tubes (usually involving the proximal 2/3 of the fallopian tubes). A hysterosalpingogram (HSG) of the nodular area with severe SIN shows several pockets (diveritculae) containing the introduced contrast material 

DDX: tubal tuberculosis :
often has multiple constrictions along the course of fallopian tube can form because of scarring and give rise to &quot;beaded&quot; appearance to the tubes on HSG.
can also have adnexal calcification

Nodular scarring of fallopian tubes (usually proximal 2/3)
Likely post-inflammatory or infectious
Strongly associated with infertility and ectopic pregnancy.

Nodular scarring of one of the fallopian tubes WITHOUT a domninant channel (AUNT MINNIE appearance)
Strongly associated with infertility and ectopic pregnancyl

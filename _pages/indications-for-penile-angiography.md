Indications: evaluation of impotence or trauma
-2 potential vascular causes of impotence (least common cause): venous leak (inability to trap blood in corpus cavenosum) and arterial insufficiency.
-Arterial insufficiency rarely is treated with IIA or internal pudendal artery angioplasty.
-Exclude correctable inflow disease of CIA and IIAs.
-Focal occlusion of internal pudendal or common penile artery represents a correctable lesion.

Blunt or penetrating perineal trauma may result in AVF of a cavernosal artery, presenting as painful priapism.
-When conservative measures fail, angio and embo may be warranted via internal pudendal access. 
-When pseudoaneurysm or AVF is identified, embo with resorbable substance such as Gelfoam pledgets or autologous clot may be performed.
-Must not confuse normal bulbospongiosal stain with vascular injury.

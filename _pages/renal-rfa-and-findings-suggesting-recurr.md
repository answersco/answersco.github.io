title: "Renal RFA and findings suggesting recurrent/residual disease"
---
RFA: can be used for benign tumors such as AML (tx at 4 cm due to bleeding risk), renal AVMs, or even RCC
More superficial lesions can be treated with RFA, while closer to the collecting system need cryoablation to avoid scarring and stricture.
RFA should not affect GFR.

Findings worrisome for residual/recurrent disease:
1. Any increase in size beyond the acute initial increase.
2. Areas of &quot;nodular&quot; or &quot;crescentic&quot; enhancement.
3. New or enlarging bright T2 signal.
-Lesions &lt; 3 cm may appear larger in 1-2 months when successfully treated.
-Lesions &gt; 3 cm do not grow larger after successful Tx.

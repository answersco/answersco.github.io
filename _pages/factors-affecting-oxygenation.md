title: "Factors affecting oxygenation"
---
1) cardiac
2) respiratory (hyper/hypoventilation)
-decreased oxygen-carrying capacity (hemoglobin carries 99% of O2 to tissues)
-example: diagnosis anemia
3) hypovolemia (reduced circulating blood volume): 
-lab values can go up b/c fluid volume decreases and increases concentration
-dehydration
-when body loses a lot of volume suddenly body goes into shock
4) increased metabolic rate 
-increases O2 demand
-stress, illness, exercise
5) developmental
-the age of the patient 
6) lifestyle 
-nutrition: helps with strength of intercostal muscles 
-exercise
-smoking
-substance abuse: normally don't have good nutrition; alcoholic cirrhosis low hemoglobin and hematocrit 
-stress
7) environmental 
-residence location
-occupation

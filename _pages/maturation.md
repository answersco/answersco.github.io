-all the individual proteins parts are put together; assembly of new viruses
-first the capsomers are synthesized by the host cell. A strand of viral nucleic acid is inserted during capsid formation. In the final assembly, the prefabricated components fit together into whole parts and finally into the finished viruses
The host cell then takes the genetic material it just synthesized and put together as well

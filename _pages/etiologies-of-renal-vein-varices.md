-Congenital venous malformation
-Renal vein thrombosis
-Obstruction of outflow (nutcracker syndrome). Pressure gradient of at least 2 mm Hg between renal vein and IVC is suggestive of renal venous HTN due to outflow obstruction. If treated, large, self-expanding stents are used, generally at least 6 cm long to minimize risk of stent migration.
-Spontaneous splenorenal shunt
-AVM
-AVF (intrarenal, or aorta to left renal vein). AVM and AVF may show high flow at venography.
Vascular renal tumor

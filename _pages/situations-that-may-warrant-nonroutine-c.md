Situations that may warrant nonroutine communication: must be documented
Findings that suggest a need for immediate or urgent intervention
These cases commonly occur in ED or ICU&#8594; examples include PTX, significantly misplaced line.
Findings that are discrepant with a preceding interpretation of the same examination and where failure to act may adversely affect patient health
May occur when the final interpretation is discrepant with a preliminary report
Findings that the interpreting physician reasonably believes may be seriously adverse to the patient's health and may not require immediate attention, but, if not acted on, may worsen over time and result in adverse outcome.

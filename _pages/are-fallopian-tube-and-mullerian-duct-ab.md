title: "Are fallopian tube and mullerian duct abnormalities associated? And the gonads?"
---
Because the fallopian tubes are derived from a different cellular origin than are the uterus and mid- to upper vagina, they are rarely involved in m&#252;llerian duct anomalies. The ovaries arise from the mesenchyme and epithelium of the gonadal ridge and are not influenced by the formation of the mesonephric or paramesonephric ducts.

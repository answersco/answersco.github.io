title: "Pulmonary nodule characteristics essentially diagnostic of benign etiology, and suggestive of (but not diagnostic of) benign etiology:"
---
Morphology essentially diagnostic for benign etiology:
Central, laminar, and diffuse calcification
Popcorn calcification&#8594; suggestive of pulmonary hamartoma
Intralesional fat &#8594; suggestive of hamartoma or lipoid granuloma.

Nodule morphology suggestive of, but not diagnostic of benign etiology:
Small nodules are usually benign. 
Any calcification in nodule is usually benign
Non-round shape (e.g. oblong, polygonal, triangular, geometric) is probably benign
Subpleural location is usually benign
Clustering of nodules&#8594; suggests infectious process

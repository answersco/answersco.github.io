Linear - within a duct (this is suspicious)
Segmental - with branches of a lobe
Diffuse/Scattered - multiple similar appearing calcifications throughout the entire breast 
Regional - large (&gt; 2cc) of breast tissue and not in the expected ductal distribution
Clustered - at least 5 calcifications within a small volume of space

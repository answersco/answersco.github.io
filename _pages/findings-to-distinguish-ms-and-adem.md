title: "Findings to distinguish MS and ADEM"
---
MS: involvement of calloso-septal interface is 98% specific and helps differentiate from ADEM and vascular lesions
Tumefactive lesions are ring-enhancing, but classically incomplete (horseshoe) with a leading demyelinating edge.
MS variants

ADEM: typically childhood or adolescence after viral illness or vaccination
Classically multiple large, T2-bright lesions which enhance in nodular or open-ring pattern.
Lesions do not involve calloso-septal interface (unlike MS)

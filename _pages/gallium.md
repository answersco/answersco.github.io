title: "Gallium"
---
- Dose - Infection imaging 5 mCi; tumor imaging 10 mCi; images obtained at 24-48 h
- Action - Fe analog, picked up by transferrin
- Normal uptake - Lacrimal glands, bone marrow, liver greater than spleen, renal (less than 24 h), bowel (after 24 h)
- Uses - infection imaging, FUO (3 weeks duration) if Indium study is negative, agent of choice for spinal osteomyelitis, sarcoid, lymphoma
o Can be used along with a bone scan for spinal osteo; if gallium uptake is higher than bone scan uptake, is positive for osteomyelitis
o Diffuse lung uptake - think PCP (uptake should be greater than the liver; Gallium often positive before lung changes are seen) or ARDS
o Kaposi's sarcoma does not take up gallium
o Sarcoidosis is very Gallium avid
&#167; Lambda sign in chest - also consider lymphoma, AIDS
&#167; Panda sign - increased activity in lacrimal, parotid, and salivary glands; must also consider Sjogren's, AIDS

liver, spleen, marrow, nasopharynx, lacrimal glands, saliv gland, GI (mostly colon)

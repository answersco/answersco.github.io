title: "Spatial resolution in CR/DR"
---
&#8593; sampling frequency &#8594; &#8593; resolution
More pixels &#8594; &#8593; spatial resolution
Images with high resolution require large file sizes
&#8593; x-rays will NOT improve maximum spatial resolution
Spatial resolution for selenium-based (direct) DR is higher than for indirect detectors (newer systems pretty close)
Structured scintillators better than unstructured (less lateral dispersion)

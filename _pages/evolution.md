-the changing allelic frequencies in populations over time 
-genome comparisons among species reveals evolutionary relationships
-the more similar the sequences are, the more recent the divergence from a common ancestor 
-98% of human DNA sequences are shared with chimpanzees
-humans share genes with mice, pufferfish, fruit flies, yeast, and even bacteria
EX. chromosome 2 actually has telomeres at both ends meaning it was known we came from chimpanzees who instead have 48 chromosomes compared to our 46

M&#252;llerian agenesis is a congenital malformation characterized by a failure of the M&#252;llerian duct to develop, resulting in a missing uterus and fallopian tubes and variable malformations of the upper portion of the vagina. It is the third most common cause of primary amenorrhoea after pregnancy and gonadal failure (such as from Turner syndrome).

-Mullerian agenesis
-unicornuate uterus
-ipsilateral renal agenesis
-normal ovaries
-vaginal atresia

Mullerian duct anomilies (agenesis):
Vaginal atresia
Absent or rudimentary uterus (unicornuate or bicornuate)
Normal ovaries
(agenesis as opposed to a septum with OHVIRA)
Associated with unilateral renal agenesis

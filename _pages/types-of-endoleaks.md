title: "Types of endoleaks:"
---
AAA Endoleaks: persistent flow into an excluded aneurysm sac after endovascular treatment with stent graft.
Type I: inadequate seal of graft (IA is proximal leak, IB is distal)
Type II: persistent collateral flow to excluded aneurysm
Typically arises from lumbar arteries or IMA
Type III: device failure causing leakage through graft fabric or segments of a modular graft.
Types IV and V: both diagnoses of exclusion&#8594; cannot be visualized on imaging, although the sac continues to increase in size.
Type IV: caused by a porous graft. It is typically transient and seen intra-procedurally. Usually resolves within 1 month after cessation of anticoagulation. Rarely seen with modern grafts.
Type V: AKA endotension, represents continued expansion of the aneurysm without any other endoleak, thought to be due to an endoleak below the resolution of imaging.

Meta-analysis: systematic reviews are studies that review other published studies
As opposed to narrative (expert opinion) review, systematic reviews identify all relevant articles on the topic in an attempt to provide an unbiased assessment of the quality of available research on a topic.
Once all relevant articles on a topic have been identified, exclusion criteria are often applied based on methodological quality
If a systematic review includes enough articles of adequate quality and similar methodology, results may be synthesized mathematically (i.e. meta-analysis)
Since they are based on more data than are available in any one study, there are considered high-level evidence.
Commonly-used statistical terms in meta-analysis
Diagnostic odds ratio: the odds of a positive test result in patients with the disease compared with the odds of the same result in patients without the disease&#8594; diagnostic OR = LRp / LRn
Heterogeneity: variation in results between studies
Reference test: gold standard against which the index test is measured
Summary ROC curve: combines several independent studies of the same diagnostic test to summarize test performance.

title: "Oxygen therapy complications"
---
1) Oxygen toxicity
-occurs when too much oxygen over 48 hour period 
-can kill or damage the cells
-can have chest pain, weakness, and dyspnea
-why you want to start at a low-flow rate, especially in COPD pt's

2) Suppression of ventilation
-knocks out the drive to breathe
-drive to breathe is too much CO2 so exhaling knocks out the CO2

3) Other complications: --combustible (catches on fire very quickly or blow up quickly) 
-source of bacterial cross infection (from the oxygen tubing
-if not changed, there is moisture in the tubing sometimes, so change frequently)

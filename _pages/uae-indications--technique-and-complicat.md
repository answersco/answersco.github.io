Uterine artery embolization (UAE): typically for symptomatic treatment of uterine fibroids and postpartum hemorrhage.
Polyvinyl chloride particles are used.
Goal of fibroid treatment is to produce hemorrhagic infarction of the hypervascular fibroids while still maintaining adequate perfusion to the endometrium and myometrium, thus preserving fertility.
Complications: include abscess, endometritis, and ovarian necrosis due to non-target embolization, leading to premature menopause.

title: "Duodenal Atresia or Stenosis"
---
Newborn radiographic &quot;double bubble&quot; is essentially diagnostic
Markedly dilated duodenum implies chronic in utero obstruction (with duodenal atresia being most common cause)
May not be seen on initial radiographs if stomach, duodenum decompressed by nasogastric tube or vomiting
Distal gas present with dilated duodenum when high obstructions incomplete, acute onset since birth, or bypassed by variant biliary pathway
Upper GI necessary with distal gas to exclude midgut volvulus (must visualize normal DJJ)

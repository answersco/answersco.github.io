title: "-20% window symmetric window means that the entire range of energies accepted represents 20% of the energy of the photopeak. For Tc at 140 kev centerline this would be 28 kev or 14 below and 14 above 140.   -100% window: 140 kev x 100 = 140 then divide this by 2 and add it to each end-&gt; 80 and 180  -20keV window: 130 and 150 key are the limits.   -112 and 168 kev are 20 percent below and 20 percent above or a 40 percent window."

What would be the upper and lower limits for a window set at 20% for Tc99?

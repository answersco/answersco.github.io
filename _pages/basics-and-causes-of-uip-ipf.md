Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF): most common interstitial PNA, and second-worse prognosis, with mean survival of 2-4 years (only acute interstitial pneumonitis is worse)
Pathologic diagnosis is usual interstitial PNA (UIP): features interstitial fibroblastic foci and chronic alveolar inflammation
IPF is clinical syndrome of UIP with unknown cause, and is most common cause of UIP, with much worse outcomes than secondary causes of UIP.
Other causes of lung injury with UIP pattern:
Collagen vascular disease (RA &gt; scleroderma)
Drug injury
Asbestosis: often also have calcified plaques indicating prior exposure

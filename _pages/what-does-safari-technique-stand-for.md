title: "What does SAFARI technique stand for?"
---
SAFARI stands for subintimal arterial flossing with antegrade-retrograde intervention. It is often performed in cases in which there is failure to cross a chronic total occlusion or enter the true lumen of the distal target artery via antegrade approach alone. Retrograde access is obtained distal to the occlusion, and a wire is used to connect the antegrade and retrograde subintimal channels. The subintimal track is then dilated with balloon angioplasty with or without stent placement.

Gelfoam is an excellent choice for branch vessel embo because of ability to obtain rapid occlusion and the potential for recanalization after several weeks. 
In patients with multiple bleeding points, a slurry of 

Gelfoam cubes can be injected proximally in the hypogastric branches or trunk. 

Very small particles (Gelfoam powder, Ivalon, spheres) shouldn't be used.

Coils may be useful when large arteries are transected, or in patients with pseudoaneurysm or AVF.

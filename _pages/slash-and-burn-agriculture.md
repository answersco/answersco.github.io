title: "Slash and burn agriculture"
---
This technique for clearing land involves slashing the bark of trees and buring the trees to the ground. The ashes help fertilize the land. Many ancient civilization used this method to create fertile farmland. However, because the fertility of this kind of farmland decreases after several years, farmers traditionally move elsewhere and repeat the process.

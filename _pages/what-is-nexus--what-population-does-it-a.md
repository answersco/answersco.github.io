-National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study
-generally applied to adults with low risk criteria who have a GCS of 15 to determine need for cervical spine imaging. looked at low risk c spine injury

-sensitivity and specificity were 99.6% and 12.9% (good study but not specific, but it doesn't miss positives!)

title: "How many Rem to the whole body and to a single organ will constistute a diagnostic medical event?"
---
&gt; 5 rem to the body (50 mSv) = effective dose
&gt; 50 rem to a single organ (500 mSv)

(If less than these, then it's just a &quot;recordable event&quot;, not &quot;reportable&quot;)

&lt; 5 rem to the body (50 mSv)
&lt; 50 rem to a single organ (500 mSv)

If greater than these, it's a diagnostic medical event that's reportable!

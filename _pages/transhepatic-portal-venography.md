title: "Transhepatic portal venography"
---
Transhepatic approach: can be used for direct opacification of portal system with approach similar to that for PTC.
-21-g needle advanced into liver under fluoro, avoiding transpleural puncture. 
-As needle is slowly withdrawn, contrast is carefully injected under fluoro.
-Portal and hepatic arterial branches both flow in the same direction- arterial flow is faster with less arborization.
-After suitable PV radicle is opacified, an 0.018 guidewire can be introduced, and needle exchanged for coaxial introducer set with 4-5 Fr outer catheter.
-0.035 guidewire then inserted into portal system, and introducer set exchanged for pigtail catheter positioned deep in the splenic vein or SMV.

Injection: 12-15 mL/sec for 36-45 mL

Depending on catheter size and patient coagulation status, it may be appropriate to embolize the tract with Gelfoam pledgets or coils at end of procedure to prevent intraperitoneal bleeding.

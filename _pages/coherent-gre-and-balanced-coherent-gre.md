Coherent GRE
Residual transverse magnetization is NOT destroyed (spoiled) after each echo..
Transverse magnetization approaches a &quot;steady state&quot; mixture of longitudinal and transverse magnetization.
The FID data and/or the echo data can be acquired.
Image contrasts&#8594; include T1/T2*, T1, and T2

Balanced Coherent GRE
All 3 gradients are balanced such that dephasing of spins is compensated for by an equal rephasing of spins
Image contrast: includes T2/T1
Good contrast between blood and muscle (e.g. cardiac imaging)
High resolution and less magnetic susceptibility than standard balanced coherent GRE images &#8594; at the expense of longer TR and thus longer acquisition time.

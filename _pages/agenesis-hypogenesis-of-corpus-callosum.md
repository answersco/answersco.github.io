Agenesis/hypogenesis of corpus callosum &#8594; commonly present with refractile seizures and/or developmental delay
Colpocephaly (dilation of occipital horns of lateral ventricles)
Lateral ventricles often parallel in orientation and widely spaced, with medial impressions upon them from Probst bundles.
3rd ventricle may be enlarged and high-riding.
Corpus callosum develops from anterior to posterior: absent splenium is most common finding.
May have associated midline lipoma or interhemispheric cyst.

---
After the RF excitation pulse&#8594; frequency encode gradient cycles continuously.
Echoes are acquired to reconstruct an image after a single RF excitation (single-shot)
Reduced image matrix often used (e.g. 32 x 32, 64 x 64, 128 x 128)
Very short acquisition times (&lt;50 msec)

Image contrast&#8594; generally T2*
T2* decay&#8594; causes the magnitude of echoes to &#8595; during image acquisition.

Uses&#8594; functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion imaging

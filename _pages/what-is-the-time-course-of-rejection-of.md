title: "What is the time course of rejection of renal txp?"
---
Hyperacute rejection occurs within minutes at the time of vascular anastamosis and never comes to imaging.

Acute rejection occurs after 7 days with the highest risk at 3 months but can occur at any time, rare after 1 year.

Chronic rejection occurs later as long term loss of function.

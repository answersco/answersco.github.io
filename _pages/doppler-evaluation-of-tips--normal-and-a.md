title: "Doppler evaluation of TIPS- normal and abnormal"
---
Normal: want to see flow directed into the stent
-Flow should reverse in the right and left portal veins and flow directly into the stent
-Flow in the stent typically 90-190 cm/s

Stenosis/malfunction:
-Elevated max velocities (&gt;200 cm/s) across a narrowed segment.
-Low portal vein velocity (&lt; 30 cm/s is abnormal)
-A temporal increase (or decrease) in shunt velocity by more than 50 cm/s also considered direct evidence.
-&quot;Flow conversion&quot;- change of flow in a portal vein branch from towards the stent to away from the stent
-Indirect sign: new or increasing ascites

title: "Calculation of magnetic field inhomogeneity"
---
Inhomogeneity of a magnetic field inside the magnet is specified relative to a reference value&#8594; the strength of the magnetic field at the magnet's isocenter.
Inhomogeneity = (actual value of the magnetic field at a given point - value of the field at isocenter) / (value of the magnetic field at isocenter)
&#8594; specified in parts-per-million (ppm), obtained by multiplying the value of the ratio by 1 million (106)

title: "Respiratory system changes in the older adult"
---
-increase in residual lung volume - alveoli are shrinking
-decrease in muscle strength, endurance, vital capacity
-decreased gas exchange, diffusing capacity
-decreased cough efficiency


Functional consequence?
-cannot clear as well so could lead to pneumonia
-difficulty with deep breaths so auscultating lungs needs to be shorter in length

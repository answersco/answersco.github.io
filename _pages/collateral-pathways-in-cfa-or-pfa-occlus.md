title: "Collateral pathways in CFA or PFA occlusion"
---
PFA is generally critically important in collateral supply of LE arteries
Occlusion of SFA: results in collateralization from the abdomen, pelvis, and contralateral extremity to the PFA, which in turn reconstitutes the SFA.
-These same collateral paths reconstitute the PFA when it is severely stenotic or occlused at its origin.

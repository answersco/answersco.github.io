title: "Vital capacity (VC)"
---
-the maximum volume of air that can be exhaled after a maximum inspiration

-expressed as IRV + VT + ERV

-Two VC measurements are the slow vital capacity (SVC), in which exhalation is performed slowly, and the forced vital capacity (FVC), in which exhalation is performed rapidly with maximum effort. 
-Obstructive disorders with small airway collapse will cause the FVC to decrease as a result of air trapping with forced exhalation.

title: "Control of pressure gradient during TIPS placement for ascites"
---
TIPS stent-graft expands over time to its maximum diameter- thus gradient may continue to drop after the procudure.

When TIPS performed for ascites, the drop in gradient can be controlled by placing a short bare stent in the parenchymal tract BEFORE deployment of the stent-graft.
-This externally constrains the stent-graft at a predetermined diameter and allows incremental increases using angioplasty balloons.

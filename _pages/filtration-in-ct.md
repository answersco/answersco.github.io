title: "Filtration in CT"
---
Copper or aluminum (6 mm)
Heavily-filtered beam can have HVL of up to 10 mm Al
Bow-tie filters: compensate for uneven attenuation of beam by the patient
Attenuate less in center and more on the edges
Made of low-Z materials (like Teflon) to reduce hardening differences
Reduce scatter and dose

Filtration&#8594; typically copper or aluminum
Typical filtration on a CT x-ray tube is ~ 6 cm
Creates a beam with HVL of up to 10 mm Al 
Reduces beam hardening effects
Bow-tie filter &#8594; used to minimize the dynamic range of exposures at the detector, &#8595; scatter, and &#8595; dose
Made of low-Z material such as Teflon to minimize beam hardening differences

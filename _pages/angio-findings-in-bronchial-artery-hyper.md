title: "Angio findings in bronchial artery hypertrophy"
---
Hypertrophied bronchial arteries are characteristically tortuous, with numerous branches to lung and hilum, and contain rapid flow.
Abnormal vessels can be large enough to see readily on aortogram.
Parenchymal blush and shunting to PAs and PVs through parenchyma may be seen
EXTRAVASATION IS RARE (even in bleeding patients).

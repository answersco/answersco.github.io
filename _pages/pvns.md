title: "PVNS"
---
Pigmented villonodular hyperplasia
Look for synovial proliferation + hemosiderin deposition + blooming on gradient echo 

These are going to be T1 AND T2 low signal (for PVNS you will have higher T2 signal)

PVNS NEVER calcifies, also it is more MASS like than synovial chondromatosis

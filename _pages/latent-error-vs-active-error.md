title: "Latent error vs active error?"

Latent = Conditions in the system allowed the error to occur (accident waiting to happen)
- &quot;blunt end&quot;

Active error = mistake that immediately cause an injury (administer wrong dose of meds, cut the hepatic artery during cholecystectomy)
- &quot;sharp end&quot;

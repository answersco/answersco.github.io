title: "QA: Linearity check?"
---
Linearity: Performed quarterly. Ensures calibrator accuracy throughout the range of activities. Decay method: Tc-99m is measured at short time intervals (q2hrs) and is graphed against the expected time-decayed activity. Shielding method: Increasing thickness of attenuating material simulates radioactive decay. The difference between expected and measured values must not exceed &#177;5%.

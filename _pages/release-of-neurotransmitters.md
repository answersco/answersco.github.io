title: "Release of neurotransmitters"
---
1) nerve stimulation
2) depolarization of axon membrane
3) Ca+ flows into nerve causing membrane to contract
4) vesicles fuse with cell membrane
5) release of neurotransmitter into synapse
6) neurotransmitter travels across synapse to receptor on effector cell

-the medications we give stop, stimulate, encourage, etc. one of these processes

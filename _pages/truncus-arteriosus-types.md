Type I truncus arteriosus is characterized by the origin of both pulmonary arteries from a short pulmonary trunk. 

Type II is characterized by the separate origin of the pulmonary arteries from the posterior aspect of the truncus. 

Type III is characterized by the separate origin of the pulmonary arteries from the lateral aspect of the truncus. 

Type IV is a pseudotruncus and is considered a form of pulmonary atresia where pulmonary arteries branches are supplied by major aorticopulmonary collaterals arising from the descending thoracic aorta.

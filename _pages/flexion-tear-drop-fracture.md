title: "Flexion tear drop fracture"
---
These are bad because you get retropulsion of the vertebrae into the spinal canal 
These are unstable fractures
85% of people will have neuro deficits
Anterior cord syndrome: temperature, pain and motor are ****ed up (anterior cord things), posterior cord things (proprioception and vibration) are preserved

**basically think of this as you are literally breaking off, in the vertical direction, the entire anterior aspect of the vertebra

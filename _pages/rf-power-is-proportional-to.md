title: "RF power is proportional to:"
---
RF power&#8594; &#8593; in proportion to the coil volume and to the square of the main magnetic field.
Example: using a smaller head coil compared to a larger body coil requires much less power. Using a 3T magnet instead of a 1.5T magnet also requires increased power for equivalent performance.

title: "Budd-Chiari Syndrome"
---
Occlusion of hepatic veins/IVC resulting in acute enlargement and hepatitis, elevated LFTs. Absent or reversed flow in hepatic veins. Large regenerative nodules in parenchyma. Think of hypercoaguable, chemotherapy, BMT.

Hepatic venous outflow obstruction 
Can happen in any hypercoaguable syndrome but the classic is pregnancy (most common cause is actually ideopathic)
Findings:
1. Systems collaterals
2. Nutmeg liver
3. Massive caudate lobe hypertrophy
4. Large regenerative (hyperplastic nodules)
5. You can see flip flop pattern of portal venous phase with CENTRAL hypoenhancement of the liver and PERIPHERAL enhancement 

Flip flop explained:
1. Arterial phase: central enhancement with peripheral hypoenhancement
2. Portal venous: Central washout with peripheral enhancement

Regenerative nodules:
1. These are typically T1 bright and T2 dark, On CT you really are NOT going to see arterial phase enhancement and on PV and delayed they are going to be ISO to background liver
2. Multiple BIG &gt;10 cm and small &lt;4 cm nodules in the setting of budd chiari suggests a benign process

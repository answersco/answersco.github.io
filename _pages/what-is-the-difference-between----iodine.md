title: "What is the difference between: - iodine &quot;trapping&quot; - iodine &quot;organification&quot;"
---
&quot;trapping&quot;: Iodine analog is transported into the thyroid gland
- I-123, I-131, and Tc99m can all do this

&quot;Organification&quot;: Iodine analog is oxidized by thyroid peroxidase and bound to tyrosyl moiety.
- Tc99m does NOT do this; it slowly washes out of the gland
- I-123 and I-131 do this

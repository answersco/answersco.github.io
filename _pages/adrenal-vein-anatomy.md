title: "Adrenal vein anatomy"
---
In most individuals, each adrenal is drained by a single vein.
Both adrenal veins communicate with renal capsular and retroperitoneal veins.

Right adrenal V: empties directly into IVC 2-5 cm above the R renal vein, usually between T11 and L1.
-Orifice located on R posterolateral wall of IVC in 75%, and on the left in about 25%

Left adrenal vein: drains into the superior aspect of the L renal vein 3-5 cm from the IVC.
-The L inferior phrenic vein forms a common trunk with the L adrenal vein before it joins the renal vein.

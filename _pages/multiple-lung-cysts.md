Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM): diffuse cystic lung disease caused by smooth muscle proliferation of the distal airways
Causes uniformly distributed, thin-walled cysts, classically associated with chylous effusion.
Emphysema: tends to be upper-lobe predominant in smokers
Pulmonary LCH: irregular cysts and nodules predominantly in the upper lungs
Diffuse cystic bronchiectasis: CF has upper lobe predominance, while congenital or post-infectious causes can have diffuse or lower-lobe distribution.
PCP PNA: cysts in late-stage disease
Lymphoid interstitial PNA (LIP): usually associated with Sjogen syndrome, characterized by alveolar distortion from lymphocytic infiltrate and multiple cysts.

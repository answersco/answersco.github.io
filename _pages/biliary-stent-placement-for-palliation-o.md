title: "Biliary stent placement for palliation of malignant hilar obstruction: principles and technique for drainage"
---
Common approach: bilateral deployment of Wallstents in a Y-configuration.
Principles of effective palliation for hilar strictures:
-Peripheral purchase within biliary tree
-Overstenting (proximal end of stent is situated at least 2-3 cm above the proximal edge of the tumor).

Deploying stents:
-2 0.035 inch superstiff guidewires are placed across the stricture into the duodenum.
-Stents are loaded on each wire in turn and placed across the stricture from right and left sides.
-Stents positioned with 2-3 cm of stent above tumor, and deployed.

-The track is often embolized with Gelfoam or a mixture of glue and lipiodol.
-If there is significant hemobilia or sepsis, a safety catheter is left through both sides for 2-3 days.
-Usually don't dilate the stents in situ unless you aren't leaving a safety catheter. If no catheter, then the stent is dilated in the area of the stricture using an 8-mm balloon to speed up the self-expanding process. The Wallstent tends to expand and shorten over time.

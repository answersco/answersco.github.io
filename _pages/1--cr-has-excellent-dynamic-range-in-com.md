title: "1. CR has excellent dynamic range in comparison to screen film.  2. S shape of a Screen film response contains regions which can generate an underpenetrated or overpenetrated radiograph.  3. The range of exposures corresponding to the region of useful imaging is much smaller than it is in CR  4. Thus Screen film has a <b>smaller</b> dynamic range than CR (also called latitude)  5. Versus the dynamic range of CR is large and there is no under or over exposure"

title: "Scintillation camera intrinsic resolution and crystal thickness?"
---
Thinner crystals result in increased resolution because of less divergence of the light produced. However, thinner crystals are less efficient which decreases sensitivity. However crystal thickness is also dependent on the energy of the photons. For low energy imaging, thinner crystals are just fine.

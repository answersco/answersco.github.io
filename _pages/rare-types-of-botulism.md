title: "Rare types of botulism"
---
1) wound infections - most rare form
2) infant botulism: came from honey where endospores may be able to grow so when ingested, it moved to the GI tract where it was reabsorbed into the bloodstream and to the neuromuscular junctions
-cannot happen in adults because our digestive system is stronger than an infant's
-bacterium grows and persists in GI tract

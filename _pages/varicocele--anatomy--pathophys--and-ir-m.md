Isolated right-sided varicoceles should prompt evaluation for cancer.
Tx: indicated for infertility, testicular atrophy in a kid, and pain.

Anatomy: pampiniform plexus or spermatic venous plexus come together around the level of the femoral heads, forming the internal spermatic vein.
The left internal spermatic vein drains into the left renal vein, and the right goes directly into the IVC.

Causes: &quot;Primary&quot; factor is right-angle entry of the left spermatic vein into the high-pressure left renal vein.
-Nutcracker syndrome (compression of left renal vein between SMA and aorta) can cause left-sided varicocele.

Procedure: access the renal vein and look for reflux into the gonadal (internal spermatic) vein,
If positive, proceed deep into the vein, and embolize close to the varicocele (often with foam), dropping coils on the way back.
Often use an Amplatzer or other occlusion device at the origin.

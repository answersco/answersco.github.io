title: "Cardiac MRI: sequences and uses"
---
Cardiac MRI: provides high-resolution dynamic cardiac imaging, using primarily segmented steady-state free precession (SSFP) and/or GRE cine dequences.
SSFP: &quot;white-blood&quot; sequence that provides excellent contrast between myocardium and blood pool. Well-suited for cardiac MRI due to high tempral resolution and excellent contrast.
Cine MRI: provides quantitative assessment of cardiac morphology and function. 
Tissue characterization is typically performed with double or triple inversion FSE sequences.
Contrast-enhanced perfusion MRI: performed pre- and post-vasoldilator stress to evaluate myocardial perfusion. Normal myocardium enhances, while areas of decreased perfusion will be relatively hypoenhancing.
Delayed contrast-enhanced MRI (DE-MR): used to image changes in the myocyte to interstitial space ratio, which decreases most commonly after MI where myocytes are replaced by scar tissue.
Any delayed enhancement in DE-MR is abnormal and represents an increase in the extracellular volume fraction. May be due to prior infarct or nonischemic etiologies.
Normal myocardium nulled out with inversion time of ~300ms, and therefore appears black.

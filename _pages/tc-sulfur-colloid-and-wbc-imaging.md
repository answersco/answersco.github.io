title: "Tc Sulfur colloid and WBC imaging"
---
SC and WBCs are specially congruent normally

Infected marrow should become photopenic on Tc-sulfur colloid, but this takes about a week after onset of infection.
In-WBC will accumulate in infection

Combined Tc-SC and WBC study is considered positive for infection if there is activity on WBC, without corresponding Tc activity on the BM image.
(spatially incongruent)

Gallium better than WBC for OM of spine.

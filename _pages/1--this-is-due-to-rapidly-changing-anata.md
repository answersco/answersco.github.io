title: "1. This is due to rapidly changing anatamy along the z axis with error due to the helical reconstruction of the data.   2. Fix this with anything that increases the amount of information you are able to gather along the z axis:  3. Increasing slice thickness  4. overscanning at the end of your 360 degree rotation (where there is usually the most loss of data)  5. Scanning in 180 rather than 360 degrees"

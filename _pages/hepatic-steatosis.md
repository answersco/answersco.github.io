Hepatic steatosis:
Unenhanced CT: general teaching is steatosis is present if liver attenuates at least 10 HU less than spleen
CECT: less reliable, but considered diffusely hypoattenuating if it attenuates at least 25 HU less than spleen in PV phase
Focal fat does not have mass effect, and vessels characteristically run through it
Focal fat may also be nodular throughout the liver: US would show multiple hyperechoic nodules which would by hypoattenuating on CT. MRI shows pseudolesions drop in signal on out-of-phase dual-phase GRE, consistent with nodular focal fat.

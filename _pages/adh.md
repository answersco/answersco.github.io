title: "ADH"
---
-produced in hypothalamus
-stored in posterior pituitary
-released in response to increased blood osmolality (how concentrated blood is - higher osmolality is more concentrated and needs more fluid so ADH will come along and promote reabsorption of water by kidneys
-decreases UOP
-increases circulating volume of Na+ &amp; H2O
-loss of K+ in urine due to electrolyte shifts 
-potent vasoconstrictor
-artificial vasopressin given to treat DI and hypotensive crisis
-assess the pt for electrolyte levels, vital signs/hypertension (did we do it too well), I&amp;O's is the most important, capillary refill to make sure there's still circulation to extremities

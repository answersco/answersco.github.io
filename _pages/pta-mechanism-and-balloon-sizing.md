title: "PTA mechanism and balloon sizing:"
---
When treating a stenosis caused by atherosclerotic plaque, PTA widens the luminal diameter due to disruption of the intima and extension of the plaque into the media.
Balloons: sized by diameter in mm x length in cm (10 x 6 balloon is 10 mm diameter and 6 cm in length)
Balloon should be selected that is 10-20% larger than the vessel diameter.
Anticoagulation (usually heparin) should always be used with PTA

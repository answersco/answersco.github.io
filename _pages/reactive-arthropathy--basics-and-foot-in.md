title: "Reactive arthropathy: basics and foot involvement:"
---
Inflammatory arthritis thought to be sequela of infectious diarrhea, urethritis, or cervicitis.
Predominantly affects the feet, with appearance similar to that in psoriatic arthritis.
Initial findings include diffuse soft-tissue swelling, joint-space loss, aggressive marginal erosions, and juxta-articular osteopenia.
Bony mineralization is preserved in the later stage of disease.
Calcaneus is a common site of involvement: bony proliferative changes include erosions, enthesophytes, and fluffy periosteal reaction. 
The posterior-superior aspect of the calcaneus is a frequent site of erosion due to adjacent bursitis
Common secondary Achilles tendinitis and thickening of the soft tissues.

Glomus caroticum (carotid body tumor) &#8594; characteristically splays the internal and external carotid arteries.

Glomus vagale&#8594; typically at the same level of the neck as carotid body tumor.
Unlike carotid body tumor, glomus vagale typically displaces the internal and external carotid arteries medially and anteriorly.

Schwannoma of the vagus nerve also displaces carotids anteriorly and medially, but it less vascular. It will enhance avidly, but won't show the flow voids typical of a glomus vagale.

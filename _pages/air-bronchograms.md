title: "Air bronchograms"
---
occur when air-filled bronchi (dark) are made visible by the opacification of surrounding alveoli (grey - white). It is almost always caused by a pathologic airspace (alveolar) process, in which something other than air fills the alveoli. Air bronchograms will not be visible if the bronchi themselves are opacified (e.g. by fluid). Commonly seen with pneumonia and atelectasis.

Bronchi are usually not visible on X-ray

Opacification of alveoli adjacent to bronchi results in the dark, air-filled bronchi becoming identifiable

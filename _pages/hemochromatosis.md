title: "Hemochromatosis"
---
1&#186;: liver, pancreas --&gt; phlebotomy
2&#186;: spleen, bone marrow --&gt; chelators (usually see 2&#186; with transfusions)

-increased risk of HCC and colorectal cancer
-dark liver
-bronze diabetes

2 ways to show it:
1) Liver and spleen both T1 and T2 dark
2) In and out of phase changes opposite to those in steatosis. Low signal on IN PHASE, higher signal on out of phase (iron = in phase). 
Fat- drops out on OUT of phase (india in one-TE 2.3 ms)
Iron- drops out on IN phase (non india ink one -TE 4.6 ms)

Primary: inherited - causes more GI uptake and subsequent iron overload.
Key point: pancreas involved, spleen spared
Also involves heart, thyroid, pituitary

Secondary: from chronic inflammation or multiple transfusions.
Pancreas is spared, spleen is involved

PANCREAS = PRIMARY 
SPLEEN = SECONDARY

Hemochromatosis: either familial (AR) or secondary to repeated transfusions
Cardiac iron deposition is predominantly subepicardial
Iron deposits are paramagnetic&#8594; signal loss on T1 and T2W images.
Also see abnormally dark liver due to iron deposition.

IRON overload disease
Ways of showing:
1. LIVER and SPLEEN T1 and T2 dark
2. IN/OUT phase changes OPPOSITE those seen in hepatic steatosis

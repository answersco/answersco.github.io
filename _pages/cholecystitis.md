CT

US --&gt; dilation of gallbladder, rim enhancement (from inflamed gallbladder wall)

sickle cell
hemolytic anemia

Tc connected to imnimidiacetic acid (IDA)
Timing: patient has to have NOT eat within the last 4 hours (if they have, then the GB is not ready to fill, still trying to dump)
Patient has to HAVE eaten within the last 24 hours or else the GB will be TOO full (if this happens then you can give CCK)
Positive test: NO gallbladder filling within 60 minutes!
Quazi positive test (chronic choli): NO filling at 1 hour but POSITIVE filling at 4 hours OR filling after the administration of morphine (causes sphincter of oddi contraction). The other possibility is ejection fraction (EF) less than 30% after CCK
RIM SIGN: increased uptake in the gallbladder fossa (see picture)

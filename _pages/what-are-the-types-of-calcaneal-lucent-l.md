title: "What are the types of calcaneal lucent lesions?"
---
1. Solitary bone cyst = sharp edges (thick sclerotic edge with multilocaulted appearance (with fallen fragment down at the bottom, e.g. not stuck within the middle of fat)

2. Pseudocyst = triangular radiolucent area (may see persistent thin trabecular or visible nutrient foramen)

3. Interosseous lipoma = Fat density on CT/MRI or CENTRAL FRAGMENT stuck within the middle of fat

Since the calcaneus is an epiphyseal equivalent, remember that AIGC can occur here too!

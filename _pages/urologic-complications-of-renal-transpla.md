Urinoma: usually 1st 2 weeks post-op
Urine leak or urinoma appear as an anechoic fluid collection with no septations &#8594; rapidly increase in size.
MAG-3 NM study can demonstrate this.

Hematoma: immediately post-op, usually resolving spontaneously.
Can cause hydronephrosis if large.
Acute hematoma is echogenic&#8594; progressively becomes less echogenic and septated.

Lymphocele: usually 1-2 months after transplant, usually medial to transplant between the graft and bladder.

Acute rejection/ATN: both usually occur in first week or so.
US: pyramids become prominent, the transplant increases in size, and RI increases (normally &lt; 0.7)
MAG-3: both ATN and acute rejection have delayed excretion
ATN has normal perfusion, rejection does not.

Chronic rejection: ~1 year after transplantation
Kidney may enlarge, +/- loss of corticomedullary differentiation.
RIs will increase (nonspecific)

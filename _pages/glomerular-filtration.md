title: "Glomerular filtration"
---
-rate is greater than 60  kidneys are working well
-the lower the GFR the more damage to kidneys
-less than 10 you want to think about dialysis
-if BUN or creatinine goes up kidneys aren't working well

-glomerular filtrate collects in capsular space
-creates a plasma-like filtrate of the blood
-GFR controlled by adjusting glomerular blood pressure from moment to moment
-GFR control is achieved by three homeostatic mechanisms: 
1) Renal autoregulation
2) Sympathetic control
3) Hormonal control

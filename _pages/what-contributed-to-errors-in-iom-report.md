title: "What contributed to errors in IOM report?"
---
The report identified several fundamental factors contributing to the errors, including (1) the decentralized nature of the healthcare delivery &quot;nonsystem,&quot; (2) the failure of the licensing systems to focus on errors, (3) the impediment of the liability system to identify errors, and (4) the failure of 3rd-party providers to provide financial incentive to improve safety. Most errors were felt to be system errors rather than individual problems.

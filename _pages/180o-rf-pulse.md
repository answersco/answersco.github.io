title: "180&#186; RF pulse?"
---
An RF pulse can be selected that causes the net magnetization vector Mz to inverted 180&#186;, -Mz (antiparallel). An initial 180&#186; RF pulse produces no synchronization of precession, thus there is no measurable MRI signal. A 180&#186; RF pulse rotates the net vector into an inverted orientation, -Mz after which the Mz vector grows back by T1 relaxation into the longitudinal orientation until it is fully relaxed.

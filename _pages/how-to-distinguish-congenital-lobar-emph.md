title: "How to distinguish congenital lobar emphysema from congenital bronchial atresia?"
---
Congenital bronchial atresia has triad: mucous impaction, distal hyperinflation (air trapping) and hypo perfusion from reflex vasoconstriction
- most commonly apicoposterior segment of LUL
- VQ shows decreased perfusion with delayed wash-in and prolonged wash-out of the ventilation tracer

Congenital lobar emphysema: NO mucous impaction

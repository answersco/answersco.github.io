title: "What is relationship to French size and tube diameter?"
---
Unlike gauge, French size is proportional to the diameter. Larger Fr size the larger the catheter/tube diameter. Fr/3= mm diameter. Ie 9 Fr = 3mm diameter (9/3=3). This is the external diameter, and the internal diameter will be smaller.

title: "What is the relationship between Right Ao arch and congenital heart disease?"
---
A R Ao arch with mirror image branching has a very high association (&gt; 95%) with cyanotic congenital heart disease, especially TOF, truncus arteriosus, and D-TGA. IF instead of MIB, there is an aberrant L SCA, then only 10% assoc with TOF.

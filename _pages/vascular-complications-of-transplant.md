Renal artery thrombosis: in 1% of transplants within 1st week.
Renal artery stenosis: usually at anastomosis
PSV &gt; 200-300 cm/s
PSV ratio &gt; 3 (external iliac artery: renal artery)
Tardus parvus waveform (measured at main renal artery hilum, not arcuates).
Anastomotic jets.
Renal vein thrombosis: more common in 2nd week
Typically swollen kidney
Commonly show the renal artery&#8594; reversal of diastolic flow (reverse M sign).
Arteriovenous fistula: secondary to biopsy
Shown on US with tissue vibration artifact (perivascular mosaic color assignment), high arterial velocity, and pulsatile flow in the vein.

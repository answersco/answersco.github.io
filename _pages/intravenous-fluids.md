1) Crystalloids - clear fluids

2) Colloids - fluids that cannot see through, EX. lipids

3) Tonicity - Homeostasis serum = other body fluids
-Isotonic: Same tonicity as body fluids; only one given rapid infusion
-Hypotonic: Fluid shifts out of blood and into cell so cells clump up (plumped up cells)
-Hypertonic: Pull fluid into vascular system (raisin-like cells)

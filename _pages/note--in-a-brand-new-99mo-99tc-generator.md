title: "Note: In a brand new 99Mo/99Tc generator there is only 99Mo activity and no 99Tc activity. A typical generator starts with about 37 Gbq (1 Ci) of 99Mo. As the 99Mo decays, 99mTc is produced and increases until equilibrium is reached. Also note that for practical purposes the parent and daughter activity may be taken to be approximately equal."

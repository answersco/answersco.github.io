title: "Giant cell arteritis imaging findings"
---
-Mural inflammation; vessel wall thickening and enhancement
-Indistinguishable from Takayasu arteritis but latter more common in younger patients
-Vital MR sequences are pre and post-contrast axial T1 GRE, TE-MRA, and high spatial resolution MRA
-Time resolved MRA may be helpful to show end organ perfusion defects: MR better than CT to differentiate active from chronic vasculitis, Irregular luminal configuration
-Varying degree of stenosis

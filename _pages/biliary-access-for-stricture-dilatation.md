title: "Biliary access for stricture dilatation"
---
-Traditional method is transhepatic access with dilatation of a track through the liver parenchyma with placement of a balloon catheter across the stricture site.
-A less traumatic access is the use of retrograde access through a Roux loop. Some surgeons when fashioning the Roux loop for hepaticojejunostomy or choledochojejunostomy fix a portion of the Roux loop anteriorly underneath the abdominal wall. Clips or a metallic ring mark the site for access of the loop with wires/catheters placed retrograde though the loop into the intrahepatic biliary tree.
-Even if surgeon hasn't fixed the Roux loop underneath the anterior abdominal wall, the loop can still be used for retrograde access. A transhepatic cholangiogram is first performed and contrast injected. When contrast enters the loop, it can be punctured under fluoro and used for biliary access.

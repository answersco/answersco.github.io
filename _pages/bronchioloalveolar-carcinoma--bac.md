BAC: spectrum of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma that demonstrates lepid growth.
Most commonly indolent and often negative on PET.
Nonmucinous BAC: classically presents as ground-glass or solid nodule with air bronchograms. Better prognosis than mucinous subtype.
Mucinous BAC: tends to present with chronic consolidation. Important consideration for chronic ground-glass or consolidation, often with air bronchograms. 
Compared to PNA, BAC is usually a non-resolving consolidation with (near) normal WBC.
CT angiogram sign: especially prominent appearance of enhancing pulmonary vessels seen in a low-attenuation, mucin-rich consolidation of mucinous BAC.

Favoring benign:
Presence of fat
Rapid doubling time (&lt; 1 month)
Slow doubling time (&gt; 16 months).
Stable at 2 years = benign

Favoring malignancy:
Spiculated margins, &quot;Corona radiata&quot; sign
Air bronchograms through nodule (usually adenocarcinoma in situ)
Partiall solid lesions with GG component (most suspicious morphology).

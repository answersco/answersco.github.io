title: "Perc chole using transhepatic approach: advantages and disadvantages"
---
Advantages:
-Entry of catheter into the GB is closer to the attachment of the GB to the liver (bare area):
-GB is less mobile closer to bare area).
-Bile leaks potentially tamponaded by liver (due to bare area). In practice, it is difficult to determine the location of the bare area and thus hard to traverse the bare area. Authors (Requisites) insert the catheter vertically into the GB, making sure the catheter passes through a portion of the liver en route to the GB.

Disadvantages:
-If large tracks required for perc cholecystolithotomy, risk of hemorrhage increases. Authors have had no trouble doing this despite risk.

title: "Cervical arch"
---
Aortic arch derived from 3rd rather than 4th branchial arch
These arches are recognizable by their unusually high location in the chest, frequently in the apex of the hemithorax.
These arches tend to be somewhat ectatic and elongated, with associated anomalous great vessel origins.

title: "Optic nerve glioma"
---
Low grade pilocytic astrocytoma. Most common tumor of optic nerve. Typically occurs during first decade of life. High association with neurofibromatosis type 1. Enlarged sheath complex may be tubular, fusiform, or eccentric with kinking. Rarely calcify.

Childhood tumors&#8594; associated with NF1, and are often bilateral
Variable appearance, often with fusiform enlargement of the optic nerve and variable enhancement. Like JPA, it may have a cyst and nodule appearance.

Adult optic nerve glioma&#8594; usually anaplastic astrocytoma or GBM
Enhancing mass, which often extends intracranially to involve the optic chiasm.

Most common cause of diffuse optic nerve enlargement
pilocytic astrocytoma
bilateral --&gt; NF
rare calcifications
80% in kids &lt; 10 y old

If bilateral thent hink NF1
If unilateral, then they could be a GBM
Most of the time these are grade 1 astrocytomas

Expansion/enlargement of the ENTIRE nerve

-T2 hyperintense, enhancing ENLARGED nerve
-NF 1

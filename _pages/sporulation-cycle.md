title: "Sporulation cycle"
---
-during adverse conditions, a spore is formed in the cell
-it is then released as a free endospore in the environment
-does not reproduce, just stays where it is
-once conditions are favorable again, germination happens and it is a vegetative cell again in favorable conditions

EX. Anthrax in envelope is opened and endospores would release into the environment. While inactive, it can become active when it finds a favorable environment in the office building

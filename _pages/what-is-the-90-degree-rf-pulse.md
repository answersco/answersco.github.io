title: "What is the 90 degree RF pulse?"
---
The duration of exposure to the RF pulse can be selected so that the # of parallel and antiparallel protons can be equalized&#8594; resulting in no net longitudinal magnetism, MZ = 0&#8594; the only net vector of magnetism is the transverse vector (Mxy )
&#8594; The amount of RF energy required to equalize the parallel and anti-parallel protons (resulting in MZ = 0) &#8594; is defined as the 90&#176; RF pulse
A 90&#176; RF pulse&#8594; produces the largest Mxy vector and thus the the strongest MRI signal for that voxel of tissue.

title: "What is the nemesis of gamma emission (e.g. isomeric transition)?"
---
Internal conversion

- Energy that'd normally be emitted via gamma emission is transferred instead to another electron in the atom --&gt; expels the electron, then you get the usual Auger electron or characteristic XR. 

POINT: Doesn't contribute to gamma imaging

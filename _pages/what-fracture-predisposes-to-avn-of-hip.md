title: "What fracture predisposes to AVN of hip?"
---
Displaced intracapsular fracture (disrupts the circumflex femorals) = degree of displacement corresponds with risk of AVN

(Intra capsular fractures = Subcapital, Transcervical, and Basicervical)

(Extra capsular fractures = trochanteric, intertrochanteric, and subtrochanteric - e.g. from bisphosphonates)

Displaced intracapsular fracture (disrupts the circumflex femorals) = degree of displacement corresponds with risk of AVN

(Intra capsular fractures = Subcapital, Transcervical, and Basicervical)

(Extra capsular fractures = trochanteric, intertrochanteric, and subtrochanteric)

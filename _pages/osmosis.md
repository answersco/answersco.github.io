title: "Osmosis"
---
-movement of water through a semipermeable membrane from an area of lesser solute concentrate (hypo-osmolar) to an area of greater solute concentrate (hyperosmolar) until equilibrium is established

-when a selectively permeable membrane prevents large solutes from diffusing but water is diffused
-water diffuses in an effort to maintain equal concentrations of solute in each compartment
-dilutes the side with more solute

movement of solvent to solution (more to less)

title: "How is R biliary tree accessed?"
---
Via a R midaxillary line two puncture approach. Needle directly over the ribs (nv bundle runs under the ribs). Insert 22 G needle parallel to table and to inferior liver border. Inject contrast as needle is withdrawn in an attempt to opacify the biliary tree. Once bile duct is opacified, leave needle in place. Do second puncture with 21 G needle as lw as possible to access the duct. Once the second needle has accessed the duct, a 0.018 inche wire is advanced, exchanged for a 5 or 6 Fr sheath, and then a hydrophilic wire is guided into the small bowel. Exchange hydrophilic for a stiff wire and then the biliary drain is placed. (Cut sideholes if you want)

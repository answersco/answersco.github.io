symmetric erosions, widening, and sclerosis of the SI joints

Only SUBSEQUENTLY does the spine become involved, following a SPECIFIC SEQUENCE which ascends from the lumbar --&gt; cervical spine. This is the order:

1) &quot;Romanus lesions&quot; - erosions of the anterior superior or inferior edges of the vertebral body endplates caused by enthesitis (inflammation at a ligament or tendon insertion site) at attachment of the annulus fibrosus to the vertebral body

2) &quot;Shiny corners&quot; - represent sclerosis of prior Romanus lesions at the corners of the vertebral bodies

3) &quot;Squaring of the vertebral body disc margins&quot; - develops d/t erosions and bone loss

4) Delicate dyndesmophytes - represents bony bridging connecting adjacent vertebral margins, creating the classic &quot;bamboo spine&quot; (spine ankylosis) in late-stage disease

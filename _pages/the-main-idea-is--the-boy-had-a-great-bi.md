Yesterday was my birthday. When I woke up, I noticed my brother Todd hung up a big sign that said, &quot;Happy Birthday, Joey!&quot; Mom made spaghetti for dinner. It's my favorite food in the whole world. My friend Dave came over and handed me a wrapped gift. I wondered what it was. It was a new game for my xbox! I will never forget today.

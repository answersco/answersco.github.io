title: "Under-Sampling Artifact in CT"
---
Under-Sampling: insufficient # of projections used to reconstruct the CT can diminish quality and create misregistration artifacts.

View aliasing: under-sampling between projections
See fine stripes radiation from the edge (but at a distance from) a dense object
Fixed by acquiring the largest possible # of projections per rotation- slowing the rotation speed.

Ray aliasing: under-sampling within a projection
See stripes appearing close to the structure.
Fixed by using specialized high-resolution techniques.

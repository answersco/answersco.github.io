Atypical adenomatous hyperplasia of lung (AAH): precursor of adenocarcinoma
Adenocarcinoma in situ (ACIS): &lt; 3 cm, with multiple subtypes
Minimally invasive adenonocarcinoma (MIA): &lt; 3 cm
&lt; 5 mm stromal invasion (&gt; 5 mm is lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma)

Usually Ground-Glass
Classically COLD on PET
&quot;Fried egg&quot;- GG halo around nodule
Pseudocavitation: bubble-like lucencies

Larger the solid component of the &quot;part solid&quot; nodule, the more likely it is to be malignant.
Partially solid nodules more commonly cancer than purely GGO nodules.

title: "Collateral supply in distal brachial artery or ulnar/radial occlusion"
---
High in the arm: collateral supply from the profunda brachialis artery 
Around the elbow: through the radial and ulnar collateral arteries to radial and ulnar recurrent arteries.

Occlusion of either the radial or ulnar artery is well tolerated by the fingers as long as one or both arches are intact.

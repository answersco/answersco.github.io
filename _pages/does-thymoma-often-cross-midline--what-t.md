title: "Does thymoma often cross midline? What to think of when you see anterior mediastinal mass in young woman (20s)?"

Does NOT often cross midline (usually one lobe of the thymus)

In a female, think of LYMPHOMA first if large anterior mediastinal mass. Females RARELY get malignant neoplasm of germ cell origin

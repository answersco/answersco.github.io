title: "US pulse repetition period"
---
Pulse repetition period = time between successive individual pulse emissions
Minimum pulse repetition period (PRP)
The limit for PRP = 2D / c
c = speed of sound propagation
D = maximum depth of the field of view
This represents the time needed for the emitted pulse to reach the maximum depth of the FOV and for the corresponding echo to travel back to the transducer.
The reciprocal of the pulse repetition period (PRP) is often used &#8594; pulse repetition frequency (PRF)
PRF = 1 / PRP = c / 2D
Usually described in units of kHz (i.e. 1000 pulses per second)
Also, PRF = frame rate x lines per frame

Makes it WORSE.

The presence of the metal induces substantial inhomogeneity in the magnetic field.
Gradient-echo images are particularly sensitive to magnetic field inhomogeneities because they do not have a 180-degree pulse to refocus the magnetization. This effect is exacerbated with longer echo times.

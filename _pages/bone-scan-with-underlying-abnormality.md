title: "Bone scan with underlying abnormality"
---
Positive triple phase Tc-99m-MDP bone scan is only specific for osteomyelitis (OM) in the XR is normal.
Gallium imaging can increase specificity of positive bone scan, especially for vertebral OM and discitis.
Discordant Ga uptake (more extensive and intense relative to MDP) suggests OM; minimal Ga uptake suggests no OM; concordant Ga/MDP uptake is nondiagnostic.

WBC scan (typically indium-111) can increase specificity in evaluation of an infected prosthesis, typically performed in conjunction with Tc-99m sulfur colloid. 
Discordant region with increased WBC tracer uptake and decreased sulfur colloid uptake is suggestive of marrow replacement by WBCs, consistent with OM. Normal marrow should demonstrate uptake of WBCs and sulfur colloid.

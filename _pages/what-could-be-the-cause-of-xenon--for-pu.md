title: "What could be the cause of Xenon (for pulmonary ventilation) accumulating in a subdiaphragmatic location?"

Hepatic steatosis. A single projection view is typical of a Xenon study, whereas Tc-99m-DTPA is typically performed in multiple projections, and often shows residual activity in the mouth, stomach, and/or esophagus.

Because xenon is lipophilic, it preferentially distributes to fatty tissues, such as the brain or a fatty liver.

title: "What is the appearance of microvascular obstruction on Late Gd enhancement imaging?"
---
- Areas of dark signal in enhanced tissue at the infarct CORE (acute and subacute finding). 2/2 microvascular obliteration in the setting of acute infarct.
- Usually these areas are SMALLER than the area of infarct

- Gd is unable to enter these regions EVEN AFTER RESTORATION OF EPICARDIAL FLOW
- therefore, microvascular obstruction is NOT seen in chronic disease (these areas eventually scar)

- Poor prognostic factor

title: "IMPORTANT: How does quantum mottle relate to number of incident photons on the detector?"
---
Quantum mottle is inversely related to the SQUARE ROOT of mean # of incident photons on detector.

Ex) If you increase # of incident photons by 100x, then you decrease quantum mottle by factor of 10

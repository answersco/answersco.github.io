title: "Patient geometry: contact vs. magnification MM"
---
-Contact MM:
SID&#8594; typically 65-70 cm for contact MM
Breast in contact with Bucky
-Magnification MM:
SID remains constant
Breast moved away from the film (&#8595; SOD)
SOD is 35 cm in magnification mode (so magnification is 1.6 by M = SID/SOD)
Absence of grid for magnification MM &#8595; the required mAs by ~30% compared to contact MM
&#8595; x-ray tube currents (i.e. 25 mA) &#8594; &#8593; exposure times by a factor of ~3

title: "Bilateral otosclerosis"

On CT the detection of otosclerosis can be difficult to the inexperienced eye because the spread of the disease is often symmetrical. 
A small lucency at the fissula ante fenestram is typical for otosclerosis. 
In more severe cases lucencies are also present around the cochlea. 
Sometimes the whole otic capsule is surrounded by these 'otospongiotic' foci, forming the so-called fourth ring of Valvassori. 
In a minority of patients the disease is unilateral. 
This is virtually always limited to a lucency at the fissula ante fenestram.

There is a lucency anterior to the oval window (arrow) and between the cochlea and the internal auditory canal. 
This is combined fenestral and retrofenestral otosclerosis.

title: "Basic technique for crossing an occlusive lesion via subintimal revascularization"
---
Subintimal revascularization = intentional dissection in the media around the occluded lumen and intimal disease.
-Proposed benefits: absence of atheromatous disease in the media, and the ability to recanalize extremity long distances (such as groin to ankle).
-Angled catheter used to direct a guidewire (usually angled hydrophilic) into the subintimal space above the obstruction.
-A loop of guidewire is formed in the subintimal space and used to dissect around the lesion.
-The guidewire spontaneously reenters the true lumen distally at the interface of plaque and normal intima in 2/3 of cases, often well distal to the actual obstruction.
-When spontaneous reentry doesn't occur, specialized devices can puncture back into the lumen.
-After confirming successful navigation across the lesion by aspirating blood or injecting contrast, a working guidewire is advanced through the catheter to provide stability for the intervention (usually relatively stiff guidewire).

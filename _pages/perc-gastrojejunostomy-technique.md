title: "Perc gastrojejunostomy technique"
---
Prerequisite: proper angulation of the percutaneous tract.
-Crucial to angle the tract toward the pylorus to facilitate passage of a guidewire and tube toward the pyloric canal.

Procedure is similar to that for gastrostomy intially.
-Stomach distended and gastropexy performed.
-Needle inserted into stomach and angled toward pylorus.
-0.035 J-guidewire passed toward pylorus.
-Kumpe catheter placed over guidewire and wire is removed.
-Contrast injected through Kumpe to outline outflow tract.
-0.035 hydrophilc guidewire used in conjunction with Kumpe to negotiate beyond ligament of Treitz into proximal jejunum.
-Hydrophilic guidewire exchanged for 0.035 superstiff guidewire.
-Tract dilated and peel-away sheath loaded.
-Peel-away sheath helps direct catheter through pylorus and into jejunum.
-Contrast injected to confirm position.

title: "QA on dose calibrator"
---
Dose calibrator uses an ionization chamber to measure pharmaceuticals, with readout in mCi.
-Range of most devices is 30 microCi - 2 Ci
-Dose should be within 5% of computed activity, and this should be checked daily

Constancy: within 5% of computed activity DAILY using reference sources

Linearity: checked with large activity of Tc QUARTERLY

Accuracy: measures standard measurements of radiotracers at installation and then ANNUALLY

Geometry: performed at installation and any time you move the device.

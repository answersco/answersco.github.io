*cell membrane @ constant size by secretion
1) protein formed by ribosomes in rough ER
2) proteins packaged into transport vesicle, which buds from ER
3) transport vesicles fuse into clusters that unload proteins into golgi compex
4) golgi complex modifies protein structure
5) golgi vesicle containing finished protein is formed
6) secretory vesicles release protein by exocytosis

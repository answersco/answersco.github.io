title: "Will you see signal drop out on opposed phase imaging in adrenal adenoma?"
---
Yes! they usually contain lipid (intracellular)

Fat-containing adrenal masses can be classified into two main types: those that contain intracellular fat (eg, adenoma) and those with macroscopic fat (eg, myelolipoma). Adrenal masses that contain intracellular fat have been shown to lose signal intensity on chemical shift out-of-phase images compared with in-phase images owing to the presence of intracellular lipid. Adrenal lesions that contain macroscopic fat demonstrate a loss of signal intensity on fat-saturated images. A loss of signal intensity at chemical shift imaging can be seen at fat-water interfaces, typically at the borders of such lesions.

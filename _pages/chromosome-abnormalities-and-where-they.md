title: "Chromosome abnormalities and where they occur"
---
2 types have been described at metaphase

Chromosome aberrations: damage occurs early in interphase (before DNA synthesis)
-Both chromatids are broken so each daughter will get a broken copy.

Chromatid aberrations: damage occurs later in interphase (after DNA synthesis)
-Only 1 chromatid will have a break, while the other is fine.

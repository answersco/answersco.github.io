title: "Does larger or smaller matrix size cause improved spatial resolution? What gets sacrificed?"
---
Larger matrix size

(F = PM, therefore P = F/M)
- Larger matrix will give you smaller pixels and therefore better spatial resolution 

* Larger matrix size --&gt; more acquisition time and reduced count density/pixel --&gt; degrades image CONTRAST

T1 low, T2 bright, enhances avidly

Giant cell tumor of tendon sheath (Basically PVNS of tendon sheath)
Usually palmar tendons of hand, often bony erosions
Soft-tissue density
T1 and T2 dark, uniform enhancement
Blooms on gradient

Fibroma: benign overgrowth of tendon collagen
Low T1 and T2, no blooming on GRE

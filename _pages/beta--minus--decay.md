title: "Beta (minus) Decay"
---
This is where an atom is trying to become MORE POSITIVE
(Think of a neutron as a part + and part - )
With beta minus decay, the NEUTRON gives off it's negative component as a BETA PARTICLE (basically just an electron that arises from the nucleus)
This is NOT good for medical imaging as you give off a beta particle that can **** up different tissues

title: "Perc cholecystolithotomy"
---
Can be performed regardless of stone#, size, and composition.
-Performed only in those patients with symptomatic gallstones who are unfit for surgery.
-Time interval between perc chole and PCCL is usually 4-6 weeks.
-26-30-Fr track required using the existing perc chole track. Track dilation achieved using 8-10 mm balloons or fascial dilators (author prefers balloons).
-Stones removed by basket (or using graspers or alligator forceps), or, if large, lithotripsy performed. Mechanical lithotripsy usually attempted first, followed by ultrasonic lithotripsy if it fails (ultrasonic, electrohydraulic, and laser lithotripsy require insertion of an endoscope into GB).
-A large catheter is inserted into GB (usually 26-28 Fr Malecot) to maintain track and prevent bile leakage. Catheter remains in place for 2-3 days, and patient returns for a final check cholecystogram.

Limited data suggest high rate of recurrence of gallstones after PCCL, but patients are often asymptomatic.

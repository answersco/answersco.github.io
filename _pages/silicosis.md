title: "Silicosis"
---
Mining, ceramic work, and sandblasting. Upper lobe and parahilar nodules. Nodule calcification may occur. Egg shell calcification of hilar lymph nodes. Silicoproteinosis like alveolar proteinosis has increased susceptibility to TB.

Upper lung predominate lung disease seen in miners and quarry workers
Simple silicosis = upper lung predominate nodules with egg shell calcifications of the hilar nodes

Progressive massive fibrosis: Large masses in the upper lungs with peripheral radiating strands 

IF you see cavitation of these masses, then you should think SUPER IMPOSED TB

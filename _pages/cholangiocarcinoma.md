title: "Cholangiocarcinoma"
---
If it involves both lobes of the liver (biliary, portal venous etc) its stage 4

Cholangiocarcinoma: 
Klatskin tumor (hilar): most common form. 
Tends to obstruct bile ducts&#8594; intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, which can ultimately lead to lobar atrophy.
Presents as intrahepatic mass at confluence of central bile ducts, with resultant biliary ductal dilatation and capsular retraction. Tumor fingers often extend into the bile ducts
Risk factors:
Choledochal cysts
PSC
Familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome
Clonorchis sinensis infection
Thorium dioxide (alpha-emitting contrast agent): also associated with HCC and angiosarcoma.

-delayed enhancement
-dilated peripheral ducts
-capsular retraction

Usually elderly man (70s) with painless jaundice
Multiple risk factors: PSC, recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, clonorchis sensensis, HIV, hep B and C, alcohol, thorotrast.
Infiltrative growth pattern without capsule
Dilated biliary system, possibly with persistent enhancing soft tissue on delayed phase (scar enhances).
Capsular retraction is a buzzword
Encasement of a portal or hepatic vein without formation of visible tumor thrombus is a distinguishing feature of cholangiocarcinoma vs HCC.

Klatskin tumor: cholangio occurring at the bifurcation of the right and left hepatic ducts.
Has dense fibrosis- enhances on delayed imaging.

Key features: delayed enh, peripheral bilary ductal dilation, capsular retraction

Cancer of bile ducts
Most common reason in the west is PSC
Most common reason in the east is oriental cholangitis

Imaging characteristics:
Think of this thing like a SCAR forming tumor, delayed enhancement and capsular retraction from the scar tissue, dilation of biliary ducts (mainly peripheral)
This tumor ENCASES the portal vein (in contrast to HCC which INVADES)

Klatskin tumor: cholangio occuring at the bifurcation of the right and left hepatic ducts
Look for SHOULDERING or abrupt cut off on MRCP 

Staging pearls: 

Imaging often underestimates the degree of involvement
Bilateral involvement is bad
The more proximal this thing is, the worse

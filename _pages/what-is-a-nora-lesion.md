&quot;bizarre parosteal osteochondromatous proliferation&quot; (BPOP) = benign exophytic osteochondral lesion which has an appearance similar to an osteochondroma, and is typically seen in the hands and feet. 

- rare, exophytic growths from osseous cortical surfaces consisting of bone, cartilage, and fibrous tissue. 

* They are continuous with the underlying cortex, but usually without continuation of the medulla.

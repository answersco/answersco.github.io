title: "Biological effects of gradient coils in tissue:"
---
Rapidly-fluctuating magnetic fields&#8594; may induce currents in tissues.
These currents may exceed the nerve depolarization threshold &#8594; resulting in peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS)
PNS&#8594; most likely to occur in pulse sequences with high gradient duty cycle &#8594; like EPI
Retinal stimulation&#8594; results in harmless visual flashes of light called magnetophosphenes.

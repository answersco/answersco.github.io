title: "Focal nodular hyperplasia?"
---
Disorganized liver tissue with no malignant potential

Think of this as just regular hypertrophied hepatocytes essentially
On regular T1 and T2 imaging this thing is STEALTH, i.e., looks just like background liver 
On ARTERIAL PHASE these things will have UNIFORM enhancement (remember the difference between this in HCC is many including the lack of T2 bright intrinsic signal characteristic)
You can also see a central scar (PSEUDOSCAR) this thing is T2 bright with DELAYED contrast enhancement
Remember sulfur colloid can be used to differentiate these **** boys from adenomas

- These are going to be hot on sulfur colloid scan

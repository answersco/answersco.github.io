title: "What parameters are used as indicators of potential biologic effect of US?"
---
Thermal index (TI): max temperature rise in tissue secondary to energy absorption

Mechanical index (MI): how likely cavitation is to occur considering peak rarefaction pressure and frequency
-Indicator of mechanical bioeffects (streaming and cavitation).-
Matter most with contrast-enhanced US.
-Involves stable and transient cavitation.

title: "What is most common benign tumor of placenta?"

Placenta Chorioangioma = hamartoma = well circumscribed hypo echoic mass near the cord insertion (flow within the mass pulses at the fetal heart rate) = Very vascular
- remember placental hematoma will NOT have pulsating doppler flow. CAN CAUSE POLYHYDRAMNIOS

* If no blood flow, it could also be a placental sonolucency (e.g. &quot;placental lakes&quot;)

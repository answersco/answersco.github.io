title: "C. Aneurysm of the aortic root. This image shows a fusiform aneurysm of the aortic root (arrows) in a patient with Marfan's syndrome. Additionally, there is loss of the distinctness of the sinotubular junction (arrowheads), a common finding in patients with Marfan's syndrome. Compare with the normal aorta in the image to the right (coronal image). These patients need periodic examinations to determine the necessity of prophylactic surgery to prevent aortic dissection. There is no intimal flap seen, so the patient has not yet suffered a dissection."

2 magnetic field gradient pulses of equal area are placed equidistant and on opposite sides of a 180&#176; pulse in a spin-echo pulse sequence.
For a given gradient pulse duration (d) &#8594; the amount of diffusion-weighting that is applied in a pulse sequence is determined by the amplitude of the diffusion-weighting gradients (G) that are applied.
Typically, lower amplitudes are chosen to image slower diffusion.
The grayscale contrast in a DW image with a non-zero b value (typically 1000 units) &#8594; determined by a combination of the T2 relaxation time and the DC of the extracellular water.
However, a computed map of the ADC isolates the DC from the T2 relaxation time.
Calculation of ADC&#8594; requires 2 or more acquisitions with different diffusion weightings obtained by changing the amplitude of the diffusion gradient.

title: "Popliteal artery entrapment imaging features"
---
-Medial deviation and deformation of popliteal artery
-Stenosis/compression of mid popliteal artery during stress maneuvers, such as plantar flexion
-MR to evaluate anatomic relationship of popliteal artery with gastrocnemius muscle
-MRA in neutral, plantar flexion, and dorsiflexion positions to look for dynamic changes in caliber of popliteal artery (dx may be missed unless provocative maneuvers are performed)

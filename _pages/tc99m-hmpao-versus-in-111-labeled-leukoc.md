title: "Tc99m HMPAO versus In-111 labeled leukocytes"
---
Advantages of Tc-99m-labeled leukocyte scintigraphy compared to In-111-labeled leukocyte scintigraphy:
Earlier and shorter imaging times
Lower absorbed radiation dose
Smaller blood sample for labeling leukocytes. 
In-111 leukocyte scintigraphy &#8594; preferred in some patients with suspected sites of inflammation or infection in the abdomen or pelvis
 Because, unlike Tc-99m leukocytes, there is normally no excretion into gastrointestinal or urinary tracts.

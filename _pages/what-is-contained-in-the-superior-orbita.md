title: "What is contained in the superior orbital fissure, cavernous sinus, and Inferior orbital fissure?"
---
Superior: CN 3, 4, V1, 6
Cavernous sinus: CN 3, 4, V1, V2, 6

Inferior orbital fissure: CN V2 
* remember, V2 exits cavernous sinus then dives into Foramen Rotundum to enter the orbit via the Inferior orbital fissure (V2 - Standing Room Only) - never makes it to Superior orbital fissure

V3 exits directly from Meckel's cave inferiorly into the Foramen OVALE

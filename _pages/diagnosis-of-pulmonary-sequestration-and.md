title: "Diagnosis of pulmonary sequestration and typical management."
---
Pulmonary sequestration: portion of lung that has either no connection to bronchi or PAs, or derives its major blood supply from an aberrant systemic artery, typically arising from distal descending thoracic or upper abdominal Ao.
Both types more common in left lung base.

Intralobar: contained within pleura of normal lung
-Drain to pulmonary veins
-Usually in adults, and more common.

Extralobar: found in children
-Less common
-Drains to systemic veins

Treatment is typically surgical, but embo alone of feeding arteries may result in successful infarction of the sequestration.

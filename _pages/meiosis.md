-two divisions
-reduces chromosome number by half
-occurs only in germline cells
-four daughter cells
-used for sexual reproduction

-the process of cell division that produces haploid gametes (1n) from diploid (2n) germ-line cells
-important for survival of the species
1) maintains the chromosome number of a species over generations.
2) independent assortment of chromosomes and crossing over ensures genetic variability

-two divisions
-four daughter cells per cycle
-daughter cells genetically different
-chromosome number of daughter cells half that of parent cell (1n)
-occurs in germline cells
-in humans, completes after sexual maturity
-used for sexual reproduction, producing new gene combinations

-two phases b/c we want to make gametes
-non-identical
-haploid cells
-only have 23 chromosomes (n) compared to diploid which have 46 [2(n)]

process by which paired chromosomes, each with 2 strands of DNA, divide in reproductive cells of plants and animals undergoing cell division in reproductive organs

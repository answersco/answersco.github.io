title: "Which type pneumocytes can replicate?"
---
Only Type II can replicate
- Type II = surfactant producing 
- Type 1 = lining of the alveoli (susceptible to injury)

* Multifocal microndular pneumocyte hyperplasia (MMPH) in TS presents as &lt; 1 cm scattered pulmonary nodules due to hamartomatous proliferation of Type II pneumocytes!

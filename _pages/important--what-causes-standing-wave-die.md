title: "IMPORTANT: What causes standing wave/dielectric effects in MRI and how do they appear on the image?"
---
When the field strength of magnet increases, the wavelength of the RF pulse (gets shorter) starts to approach the size of the FOV or body part of interest--&gt; causes standing wave effects in the middle of the body

- Seen on obese patients with distended abdomen, those with ascites, pregnant

- Loss of signal in the center of an image (region farthest away from RF coil)

- Make better: apply dielectric pads (between patient and anterior body array coil; Parallel RF transmission SENSE imaging- RF pulses from a SET of coils where each COIL sends an independent RF pulse!

title: "Syphilic aortitis with aneurysms"
---
Extensive calcification of ascending Ao on CXR strongly suggests syphilic aortitis.
Characteristic features of syphilitic aneurysm:
-Sparing of sinotubular junction (although Ao regurgitation and aneurysms of sinus of Valsalva can occur)
-Saccular aneurysms in 75% with fine, linear calcification and shaggy &quot;tree-bark&quot; intima with superimposed atherosclerotic disease.

1/2 of Syphilic aneurysms in ascending Ao, 1/3 in arch, 1/5 in descending thoracic Ao, and rarely in abdominal Ao

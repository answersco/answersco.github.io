title: "Sentinal lymhnode detection"
---
First lymph node receiving drainage from the cancer
Typical agent used will be Tc 99 sulfur colloid
Amount 10-50 nm
Most common cancers this is important for are BREAST and MELANOMA 
Breast: you want to see if there is internal mammary chain drainage (Happens about 3% of the time)
Melanoma: you want to know about depth for tumors that are between 1-4mm
Size of particles for sentinal lymph node: any particle larger than 500 nm will not move. Really are looking for &lt;100 nm size particles

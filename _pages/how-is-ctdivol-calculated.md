title: "How is CTDIvol calculated?"
---
The CTDI (CT Dose Index) is a measure of the dose per slice as estimated with a 16 cm or 32 cm acrylic phantom as measured over a 100 mm length. CTDIvol takes into account the effect of mAs, kVP, pitch as well as the difference in dose at the periphery and center of the phantom. (CTDIvol = (1/3 x CTDI100 [center] + 2/3 x CTDI100 [periphery])/pitch.

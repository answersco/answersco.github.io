title: "Veins of choice for PICC:"
---
PICC: 
Basilic vein, located medial and superficial to brachial veins, is first choice
Cephalic vein: second choice&#8594; adds an extra curve as it joins the axillary/subclavian vein.
Brachial vein&#8594; risk of damaging median nerve, which lies superficial to the brachial veins.
PICC should not be placed in patients with CKD, as they may later need fistula

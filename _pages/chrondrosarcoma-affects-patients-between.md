title: "Chrondrosarcoma affects patients between the ages of 30 and 60 years with pain being the most common presentation. They may occur as primary bone tumors or develop from a pre-existing lesion such as an enchondroma. Pain is a distinguishing feature between enchondromas and chondrosarcomas.  Chondrosarcomas most commonly arise in the long bones, most frequently within the femur. Other locations include the ribs, vertebrae and scapula.  Radiographically, a large osteolytic lesion can be seen. Organized calcific rings may suggest a low-grade tumor. Alternatively, an irregular calcified matrix may suggest a high-grade chondrosarcoma."

title: "What is the difference between solids and liquids as they pertain to gastric emptying studies?"
---
Solids have a lag phase, during which the stomach grinds up the food into smaller parts.

Liquids: no lag phase

Lag time can be increased in diabetics.

AC also plays role in calculating emptying times, as movement from back to front of stomach can increase counts due to attenuation.

title: "What is an adequate window/level setting to assess the soft tissues in CT of the ankle?"
---
Level 40, window 300

Level should be set to the average density of the tissues to be evaluated (30-80 for soft tissue)
Use a narrower window for soft tissue (200-400) and a wider window for bone and lungs (1000-3000)

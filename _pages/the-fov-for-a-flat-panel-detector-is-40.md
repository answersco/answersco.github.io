title: "The FOV for a flat-panel detector is 40 cm x 40 cm and the matrix size is 2000 x 2000. What is the best spatial resolution that can be measured with a line-pair phantom?"
---
2.5 line pairs/mm
400 mm / 2000 pixels = 0.2 mm per pixel.
2 pixels are required to form a line pair (lp). 
1 lp = 2 x 2 mm = 4 mm
Spatial resolution = 1 lp / 4mm = 2 lp/mm

title: "What is difference between inversion recovery (STIR) and chemical fat saturation?"
---
Chemical fat saturation applies a narrow bandwidth pre-saturation pulse to selectively eliminate longitudinal mag of the target tissue (e.g. fat), followed by an excitation pulse.

Inversion: By applying an inversion pulse followed after a distinct waiting period by an excitation pulse

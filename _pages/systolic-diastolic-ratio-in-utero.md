title: "Systolic/diastolic ratio in utero"
---
Remember, if this is &gt; 4 then you probs have = IUGR
The ratio should DECREASE over the course ofpregnancy i.e. the resistance should go down 
General rules:
@ 32 weeks, should be 2-3
@ 34 weeks, should NOT be more than 3

WORSE prognostic indicator is absent or reversed diastolic flow

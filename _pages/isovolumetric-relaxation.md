title: "Isovolumetric relaxation"
---
-atrial and ventricular relaxation = diastole
-semilunar valves close (&quot;dub&quot;) b/c low BP in ventricles
-blood tries to back up but can't, forcing AV valves shut
-all valves closed
-atrial pressure starts increasing, pushing AV valves open, and start over with ventricular filling

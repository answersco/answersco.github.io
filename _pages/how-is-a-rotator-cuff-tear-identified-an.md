title: "How is a rotator cuff tear identified and characterized on shoulder MR arthrogram?"
---
On MRA, a rotator cuff tear is defined by contrast signal extending into the substance of the rotator cuff tendons.

A partial-thickness tear can be articular sided, interstitial, or bursal-sided.
MRA is not sensitive for bursal-sided tears, as there is extension of contrast into the bursa.

Depth of the tear should be graded ass low-grade (&lt; 3mm), intermediate grade (3-6 mm), and high-grade (&gt; 6 mm, or &gt; 50% of tendon thickness).

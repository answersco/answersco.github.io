title: "Pitch and fill-factor in FPD system"

Pitch: essentially the linear dimension of a detector element

Fill factor: 
The system isn't 100% efficient; only a portion is actually sensitive to light.
The ratio of the sensitive area over the total area is the fill factor
FF = sensitive area / Pitch2

As the detector element gets smaller, you get better spatial resolution, but the fill-factor &#8595; &#8594; smaller detector element will have superior resolution but require more radiation

Matrix = the # of detector elements (or pixels) on the surface of the FPD in each dimension (horizontal and vertical)
Pixel (detector element size) = FOV/matrix

Pitch: essentially the linear dimension of a detector element

Fill factor: 
The system isn't 100% efficient; only a portion is actually sensitive to light.
The ratio of the sensitive area over the total area is the fill factor
FF = sensitive area / Pitch^2

As the detector element gets smaller, you get better spatial resolution, but the fill-factor &#8595; &#8594; smaller detector element will have superior resolution but require more radiation

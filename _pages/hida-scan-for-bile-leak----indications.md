title: "HIDA scan for bile leak: - indications? - need (immediate/delayed) images? - where can you see the tracer? (3) - &quot;reappearing liver sign&quot;"
---
- used after trauma or surgery to look for bile leak
- get delayed imaging

Locations:
- right paracolic gutter/pelvis
- GB fossa (mimicking a gallbladder)
- perihepatic space

&quot;reappearing liver sign&quot;: labed bile may track superiorly into the perihepatic space, paradoxically increasing activity in the liver after the liver has already emptied into bowel

title: "Redistribution"

Normally upper lobe vessels are smaller than the lower lobe vessels. When interstitial edema surrounds lower lobe vessels, due to gravity, it results in blood flow being redistributed to the upper lobes. &#8594; results in a change of the normal size relationship.
If upper lobe veins are 1.1 times larger than the lower lobe vessels, this is abnormal and indicates pulmonary venous hypertension &#8594; CHF.

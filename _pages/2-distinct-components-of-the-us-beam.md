title: "2 distinct components of the US beam"
---
Near-Field (Fresnel Zone): converging
The length of the near-field (converging portion) depends on the transducer frequency and diameter
Higher transducer frequency &#8594; longer near field
Larger diameter element &#8594; longer near field

Far-Field (Fraunhofer Zone): diverging
As the beam diverges, the ability to distinguish 2 close-by objects is reduced.
Higher frequency&#8594; less divergence
Larger diameter element&#8594; less divergence
US intensity in the far-field gradually decreases with distance

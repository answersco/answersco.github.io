title: "Choroid Plexus Papilloma"
---
Most commonly occurs in lateral ventricle, especially in children. Increased intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus due to: Increased tumor production of CSF. Impaired CSF resorption (tumoral hemorrhage). CSF obstruction (mass effect). WHO grade I. May engulf glomus of choroid plexus. Choroid plexus calcification in first decade of life suggests choroid plexus papilloma.

Homogeneous enhancement. Most commonly occurs in lateral ventricle, especially in children. Increased intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus due to: Increased tumor production of CSF. Impaired CSF resorption (tumoral hemorrhage). CSF obstruction (mass effect). WHO grade I. May engulf glomus of choroid plexus. Differentiate from immature teratoma with enhancement pattern as both can calcify. Differentiate from anaplastic astrocytoma (from teratoma) by diffusion restriction (present in anaplastic astrocytoma).

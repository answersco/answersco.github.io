title: "T2 relaxation?"
---
After transverse magnetization is established by the RF pulse, the RF pulse is turned off and immediately the protons will begin to lose their synchronous precession and the net Mxy vector will decrease. The loss of synchronous precession is a normal relaxation process sometimes called spin-spin relaxation or more commonly, T2 relaxation. The induced MRI signal in an RF receiver coil will decay at a rate defined by the T2 relaxation of the tissue.

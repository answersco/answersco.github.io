Bone and air-filled viscera between the transducer and tumor can lead to complications or incomplete treatments.

Ablation zone for a single treatment is very small, approximately 1.5 x 15 mm under normal exposure parameters at 1.7 MHz.
-The confluence of numerous individual ablation zones make up the overall treatment area.
-While it only takes 1-3 seconds per treatment, the total time can be substantial depending on tumor size (up to 2 hours or longer for a 2-3 cm mass).

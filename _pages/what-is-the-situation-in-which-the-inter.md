title: "What is the situation in which the intermediate state between isobaric and isomeric transitions is prolonged?"
---
&quot;metastable state&quot;

e.g. Tc99m

Mo99m becomes Tc99m via isobaric transition (beta minus decay) --&gt; Tc99m hangouts in for a couple hours --&gt; Isomeric transition to Tc99 while emitting 140 keV photons!

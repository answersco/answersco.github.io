title: "Causes of tricuspid regurgitation"
---
Most common form of tricuspid disease due to relatively weak annulus (compared to mitral).
-TR causes RV dilation (not RV hypertrophy)

Most common in adults: pulmonary arterial HTN.

Also seen in endocarditis (IV drugs) or carcinoid syndrome (if there are mets to liver)-also involves pulmonic valve, usually both.

Seen in Ebstein Anomaly (moms who used Lithium, or sporadic): hypoplastic TV with apical (downward) displacement of posterior leaf
-Enlarged RA, small RV (atrialized), and tricuspid regurgitation
&quot;Box-shaped&quot; heart.

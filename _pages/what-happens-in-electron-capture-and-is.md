title: "What happens in electron capture and is it good for imaging?"
---
Too many protons, but doesn't have 1.02 MeV, so to turn a proton into a neutron, the nucleus steals an electron from the k-shell.

- This is followed by &quot;isomeric transition&quot; which results in emission of characteristic gamma photons that can be imaged!

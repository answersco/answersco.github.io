title: "PTC and biliary stents:"
---
Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC): 
Indications: most commonly for relief of biliary obstruction or to provide biliary diversion in the case of ductal injury.
Less common indications include treatment of biliary calculi (usually endoscopically managed) and adjunctive treatment prior to a biliary anastomosis.
Pre-procedure antibiotics: usually levofloxacin for gram-negative coverage.
The role of regular flushing is controversial. Regardless, a biliary drain should never be aspirated due to potential of drawing bowel contents into the biliary system, leading to cholangitis.
Right and left biliary trees are accessed using slightly different techniques:
Right biliary tree: accessed via a right mid-axillary line two-puncture approach. 
Left biliary tree: accessed via a left subxiphoid, single-needle approach, using US to access the biliary tree.
If stent placement is required to treat a stricture, a metallic stent is usually only placed in patients with life expectancy &lt; 6 months, as most can't be removed and have a median patency of 6-8 months.
Plastic stents (placed endoscopically) allow regular exchange.

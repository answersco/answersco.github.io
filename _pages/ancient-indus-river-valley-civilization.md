title: "Ancient Indus River valley civilization"
---
This far reaching civilization emerged along the Indus River between about 3000 B.C.E. and 2500 B.C.E. The independent development of agriculture and irrigation led to the growth of urban areas, including the cities of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa. These centers had large, socially and economically diverse populations, developed advanced technologies including a written language, and conducted trade with Mesopotamia.

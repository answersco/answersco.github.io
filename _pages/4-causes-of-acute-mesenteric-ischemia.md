title: "4 causes of acute mesenteric ischemia"
---
Arterial: occlusive emboli (usually more distal, at branch points), thrombus (usually closer to ostium), or vasculitis &#8594; usually SMA
Usually thinner bowel wall (no arterial inflow) without dilation, and diminished enhancement &#8594; becomes thick after reperfusion, with a target appearance.
Usually no mesenteric haziness unless infarcted
\Venous: bowel is dilated and thickened (8-9 mm)
Variable enhancement
Common fat stranding and ascites.

Non-occlusive: shock or pressors &#8594; hardest to diagnose
Involved segments often thickened, but not dilated usually.
Variable enhancement &#8594; look for delayed filling of portal vein at 70s
No mesenteric haziness unless infarct

Strangulation: with closed-loop obstruction
Mixed arterial and venous picture&#8594; variable enhancement
Congested, dilated bowel, often fluid-filled
Hemorrhage may be seen in bowel wall
Mesenteric haziness with ascites, and &quot;whirl sign&quot;

Cardiovascular diseases with normal-sized cardiac silhouette:
Causes:
Valvular stenosis (aortic or mitral stenosis)
Pulmonary artery HTN
Hypertrophic CM
Restrictive physiology
Acute MI
Best distinguished via evaluation of LA and aorta
LA is enlarged and cardiac silhouette is normal: suggests mitral stenosis
Aorta is enlarged and cardiac silhouette is normal: suggests aortic stenosis or aortic aneurysm
Neither LA nor aorta is enlarged&#8594; suggests one of the other etiologies.

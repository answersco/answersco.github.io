title: "SNAC wrist"
---
Scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse. Scaphoid fracture with proximal pole moving with lunate

Proximal scaphoid fractures more susceptible to AVN and non-union

SNAC wrist (scaphoid non-union advanced collapse)
Proximal scaphoid fragment usually remains attached to lunate, while distal scaphoid fragment rotates into flexion
Results in abnormal contact in radioscaphoid compartment&#8594; OA here is 1st sign
Eventually capitate migrates proximally, radially, and dorsal to lunate (DISI configuration)

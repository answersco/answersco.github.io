title: "How else can dx of torsion be made by imaging?"
---
Tc-99m pertechnetate: Dynamic flow for 1 minute (vascular phase); 5 minute intervals for tissue phase; sensitivity 80-90%
Can detect reduced or absent testicular flow in 94-99%
In testicular torsion, a rounded cold area and a halo of dartos perfusion is seen.
In &quot;missed&quot; testicular torsion, scrotal scan shows &quot;halo sign&quot; in tissue phase due to intense vascularity in dartos, and &quot;nubbin sign&quot; in perfusion phase due to increased perfusion of spermatic cord vessels.

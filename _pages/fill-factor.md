title: "Fill factor"
---
The___ the sensing area compared to the non-sensing area and can be expressed as a percentage

This is the proportion of the detector that is sensitive to xrays in relation to the entire detector area
The higher the fill factor, the more efficient the detector

Direct Systems: These have nearly a 100% fill factor
Indirect systems: do not have a perfect fill factor

title: "Tc-MDP vs. F-18 PET"
---
Both used for bone imaging
Image quality and sensitivity much higher for F-18, and shorter exam time, but much more expensive
MDP: critical organ = bone
F-18: critical organ = bladder

Tc-MDP: bone and kidney uptake. Fuzzier study

F-18: much higher resolution. Looks like MIP PET.

FDG-PET with bone stimulation: looks similar to the F-18, but will have brain uptake.

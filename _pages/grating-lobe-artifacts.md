title: "Grating lobe artifacts?"
---
Grating lobes are artifacts created from low energy acoustic waves that are stronger than the side lobe sound waves emanated from a linear transducer. Grating lobes duplicate structures laterally to the real image. The artifacts are seen predominately when a linear array transducer is used in an anechoic region.

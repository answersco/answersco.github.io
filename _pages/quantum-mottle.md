title: "Quantum Mottle"
---
Basically the concept here is that any xray is NOT COMPLETELY uniform and therefore you're going to get this quantum mottle noise
Quantum mottle is MORE NOTICEABLE at low xray beam dose
When you INCREASE field size, you DECREASE quantum mottle (as the xray beam uniformity increases (maybe?)) however the amount of scatter and dose BOTH INCREASE

what is the predom source of noise in CT

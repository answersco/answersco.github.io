title: "Mosaic attenuation"
---
Basically can be due to three things:

1. Abnormal perfusion: Hypoattenuating regions are related to decreased blood flow from either:
&#8212; chronic venoocclusive disease
&#8212; Pulmonary arterial hyeprtension
&#8212; Small airways disease (because the lung is not well ventilated blood flow is automatically decreased to the area)

2. Abnormal Air trapping: Hypoattenuating regions are also abnormal and are due to obstructive airway pathology

3. Ground glass opacity: This is the time when the LUCENT area is NORMAL and the denser area is ABNORMAL

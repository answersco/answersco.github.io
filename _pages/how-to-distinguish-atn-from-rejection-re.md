title: "How to distinguish ATN from rejection renal transplant?"
---
ATN has NORMAL perfusion with Delayed excretion, while rejection will have POOR perfusion and also Delayed excretion (blood flow sucks in a rejected transplant)

- Cyclosporin looks like ATN but is longstanding, whereas ATN is within 1st week of transplant

- delayed excretion = elevated 20/3 ratio

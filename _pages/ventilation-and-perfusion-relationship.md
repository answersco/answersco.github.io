title: "Ventilation and perfusion relationship"
---
-Relationship must &quot;match

-Given amount of blood passes alveolus = amount of gas

-Ratio is 1:1

-If one is up and one is own they need to balance

-Things that affect is are: airway blockages, asthma, food blocking trachea, ca be affected by altitude or temp. changes

-Perfusion can be altered by pulmonary/alveolar pressure

-If it is imbalanced, it can result in shunting of blood which can lead to hypoxia
--Things that can lead to this are thoracic surgeries, abdomen surgeries, respiratory failure
--If pt's do not breath deep, pneumonia can be caused

Gas diffusion decreased by
-decreased oxygen in atmosphere
- decreased amount of alveolar ventilation (COPD, atelectasis decreases surface area)
-decreased alveolar / cap surface area
-increased alveolar / cap membrane thickness

*<b> Carbon dioxide diffuses more easily than oxygen</b><b> - will cross where O2 cannot </b>*

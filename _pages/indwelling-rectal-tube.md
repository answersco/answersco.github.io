title: "Indwelling rectal tube"
---
-in some health care agencies, a rectal indwelling catheter is used for patients with uncontrollable diarrhea. -however, relatively little research supports the safety of this procedure and use should be avoided 
-disadvantages of indwelling rectal tubes include leakage and perirectal skin damage, injury to the rectal mucosa, and injury of the anal sphincter
-the fecal incontinence device is a safer alternative

title: "Osteogenesis Imperfecta"
---
Inadequate osteoid formation, normal mineralization

Bone findings:
 bowing, thinned cortex, frequent fractures
 wormian bones
 vertebral scalloping
 severe kyphoscoliosis
 acetabular protrusio

Autosomal dominant
Type 1: tarda form
 normal life expectancy
 blue sclera
 deafness (otosclerosis)
 ligamentous laxity
Type 2: congenita
 death in utero or neonatal
Type 3: 
 fractures at birth
 progressive limb deformity
 Normal sclera and hearing
Type 4:
 bone fragility, discolored teeth; otw normal

congenital bone abnormalities
multiple fractures
type I collagen
type II lethal- diagnosed second trimeser, others diag in third
shortened long bones
bone mineralization decreased (vsTD)- esp seen in calvarium

Brittle bones
Can have fibula longer that tibia
May also see COMPLETELY lucent skull
Other findings are multiple fractures with hyperplastic callus

-inactivation of allele reduces collagen triple helices by 50%
-this causes easily broken bones, blue eye whites, and deafness
-called brittle bone disease

No food for 4 hours (so GB is ready to fill), but should've eaten within 24 hours (so GB isn't so full it can't let tracers in).
If no food for &gt; 24 hours, can give CCK

Liver should have uptake within 5 minutes

Obstructed GB won't fill by 60 minutes. No tracer within 4 hours suggests obstruction.

Sturge-Weber: neurocutaneous disorder characterized by facial port-wine stain (capillary malformation in region of ophthalmic branch of trigeminal nerve [V1[), ocular abnormalities, and failure of normal cortical venous development.
Leptomeningeal venous angiomatosis with dilated capillaries and venules &#8594; leads to chronic ischemia, cortical atrophy, and cortical calcification.
Characteristic findings: cortical atrophy and subcortical parenchymal calcifications
MRI: pial enhancement in regions affected by the leptomeningeal venous angiomatosis. Choroid plexus are typically enlarged from compensatory hypertrophy.

The Sturge Weber syndrome is a phakomatosis. It is characterised by facial port wine stains and pial angiomas.

Demographics and clinical presentation
The diagnosis is usually obvious on account of a congenital facial cutaneous haemangioma (also known as port wine stain or facial naevus flammeus). This feature is almost always present and usually involves the ophthalmic division (V1) of the trigeminal nerve 4. Only rarely (~ 5%) is intracranial involvement present without associated cutaneous naevus1-2. In the majority of cases (72%) the naevus is unilateral and ipsilateral to the intracranial abnormality. 

The most common clinical manifestation is with childhood seizures, present in 71 - 89% of cases 2 that are often refractory to medical therapy 1. These usually begin in the first few years of life and are often associated with developmental delay and hemispheric symptoms including hemiplegia / hemiparesis and / or hemianopsia.

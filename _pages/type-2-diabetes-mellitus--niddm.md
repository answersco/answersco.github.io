---
-90% to 95% of diabetes
-problem is insulin resistance 
due to failure of target cells to respond to insulin
-risk factors are heredity (36 genes so far known to increase risk), age (40+), obesity, and ethnicity (Native American, Hispanic, and Asian)
-treated with weight-loss program and exercise since loss of muscle mass causes difficulty with regulation of glycemia and adipose signals interfere with glucose uptake into most cells
-if necessary, also use glycemia-lowering oral medications and, if still not enough, use insulin

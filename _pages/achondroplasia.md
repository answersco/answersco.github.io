title: "Achondroplasia"
---
Autosomal dominant (heterozygotes)
Abnormal bone formation at growth plate
Rhizomelic - short proximal limbs
Short interpedicular distance narrowing distally
Spinal stenosis - short pedicles
Ping pong pelvis - round iliac bones, horizontal acetabular roof
Small skull base and foramen magnum (enchondral ossification)
Normal sized calvarium (membranous ossification)

See image for classic findings

1. Shortening of the femurs
2. Horizontal acetabula
(And a few others)

Form of dwarfism
This is a rhizomelic process (means the femurs and humeri are short)
Advanced paternal age is a risk factor
Note: typically the pedicles widen as you go down the vertebral bodies; however, they get more NARROW in achondroplastic dwarfs

Rhizomelic, decreased interpedicular distance, tombstone pelvis

title: "IM injection guidelines"
---
-rotate sites, not usually an issue bc we do not give repeated IM injections often
-avoid tender and bruised areas
-Z track with highly irritating solutions 
-never use larger than a 19 gauge needle for IM injections, usually 21-23 gauge
-determine gauge and length by: weight &amp; muscle mass, age, injection site, medication viscosity, and residual effects of the medications

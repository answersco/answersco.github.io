title: "Atrial switch - Senning vs Mustard procedure"
---
- Senning and mustard procedures 
- performed during the first year of life

- used to correct TGA by creating a baffle within the atria in order to switch back the blood flow at the level of in-flow
- Result: RV becomes the systemic ventricle, and LV pumps to the lungs

Mustard procedure uses pericardium (or synthetic material) for creation of baffle
- Senning does NOT use synthetic material

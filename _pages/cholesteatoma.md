title: "Cholesteatoma"
---
Soft tissue mass (epidermoid cyst of desquamating stratified squamous epithelium) within middle ear cavity. Typically associated with bone erosion. Superior tympanic membrane (pars flaccida) is the most common site. CT images extent of disease.

Cholesteatoma is believed to arise in retraction pockets of the eardrum. It gradually enlarges over time due to exfoliation and encapsulation of the tissue.
Most cholesteatomas are acquired, but some are congenital. 
The ENT surgeon often states that cholesteatoma is a clinical diagnosis. Scraps of cholesteatoma are visible in the external auditory canal.

On CT a small cholesteatoma presents as a soft tissue mass. 
 In more extensive disease erosions may be present.
Large cholesteatomas can erode the auditory ossicles and the walls of the antrum and extend into the middle cranial fossa. 

The most affected structures are: 
&#8226;Auditory ossicles, especially the long process and lenticular processes of the incus as well as the head of the stapes 
&#8226;Wall of the lateral semicircular canal 
&#8226;Lateral epitympanic wall (the scutum)

There were granulations on the left ear drum. 
CT demonstrates a soft tissue mass between the ossicular chain and the lateral tympanic wall, which is eroded. 
this favors the diagnosis of cholesteatoma.

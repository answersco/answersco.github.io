title: "Cell survival curve: what is the shoulder, and what is the slope?"
---
Shoulder = repair shoulder, or quasithreshold
-Repair mechanisms are keeping the cells alive. 
-Measure of sub-lethal damage
-Only exists with LOW-LET radiation curves

1 / slope = D0
- describes the linear portion of the curve and the radiosensitivity of the cell population
-The higher the Do the more radio-resistant the cell is.
-Slope is the mean lethal dose

Higher dose rate- creates small shoulder and steeper drop in curve
Oxygen will also cause a steeper drop in curve (more pronounced with low LET).

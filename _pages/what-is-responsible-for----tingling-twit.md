title: "What is responsible for: - Tingling/twitching sensation in the arms during MRI - Thermal injury from medication patch - Rise in body temp - Displaced medical implant device?"
---
- Tingling/twiching = Rapidly switching gradient fields (&quot;time-varying magnetic field gradients&quot;) induce magnetic fields and cause peripheral nerve stimulation

- Thermal injury &amp; rising body temp = it's the RF PULSE ITSELF depositing energy!

- Displaced implant: The static field dislodges it

title: "What is a best practices dashboard?"
---
A best practices dashboard, according to Stephen Few, is &quot;...a visual display of the most important information needed to achieve 1 or more objectives; consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the information can be monitored at a glance.&quot; 

Benchmarking is a measurement of the quality of an organization's policies, products, programs, strategies, with a means for comparison to others.

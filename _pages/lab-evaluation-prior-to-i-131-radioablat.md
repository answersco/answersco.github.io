title: "Lab evaluation prior to I-131 radioablation"
---
After surgery, they will normally have some residual thyroid.
Give tiny dose of I-131 prior to treatment: ideally have uptake &lt; 5%
Uptake &gt; 5%: results in painful ablation (may need steroids in addition to NSAIDS), and may need to go back to OR.

Want TSH ramped up prior to treatment to enhance uptake.
Ideal TSH ~50 (30 is a minimum)
Stimulate TSH by stopping thyroid hormone and/or giving recombinant TSH (thyrogen)

Thyroglobulin: monitors for recurrence. Anything over 0 is abnormal, but trend is more important.

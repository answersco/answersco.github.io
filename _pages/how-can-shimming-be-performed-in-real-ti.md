title: "How can shimming be performed in real-time on newer scanners?"
---
Gradient coils necessary for imaging act in the same manner as 1st order shim coils
Normally, large current pulses are sent to the gradient coils&#8594; generate the short-lived, strong magnetic field gradients required for encoding of spatial information during imaging sequences.
By sending small DC currents through those coils, one can perform the 1st order shim as well.
Combining these 2 approaches permits performing 1st order shimming in real time (i.e. during the exam).
&#8594; this improves the homogeneity of the magnetic field on a per-patient basis&#8594; &#8593; image quality
Most new scanners offer this functionality

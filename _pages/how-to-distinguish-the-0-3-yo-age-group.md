1. Nephroblastomatosis = homogeneous hypodense rind along the kidneys that should be FOLLOWED q3mo til age 7 yo, to ensure no conversion to WILMS

2. Mesoblastic nephroma = Solid Renal tumor of infancy is benign &quot;RENAL HAMARTOMA&quot; (may look like Wilms, but WAY TOO YOUNG)
- most common renal tumor in first 3 mo of life!

3. Multicystic dysplastic kidneys = In utero obstruction results in NON-COMMUNICATING renal cysts WITHOUT Functioning renal tissue
- often associated with UPJ obstruction of the other side
- hydronephrosis will communicate

title: "Gastrostomy technique (after gastropexy)"
---
It's important to keep stomach inflated throughout the procedure to avoid complications.
-Area in center of T-fastener square anesthetized and incision made.
-The slotted needle used for gastropexy is used to puncture the stomach.
-Puncture site is angled toward pyloric canal or antrum so that the angle of the tract will facilitate conversion of gastrostomy to G-J if needed.
-0.035 inch superstiff guidewire inserted into stomach and coiled in lumen.
-Successive fascial dilators used to dilate the percutaneous tract.
-Tract dilated to a size 1-2 French larger than the catheter to be inserted.
-A 14-18 Fr gastrostomy tube is placed through a peel-away sheath into the stomach. Despite angling of tract, the tube usually ends in the fundus because it is more posterior and capacious.
-Guidewire removed and contrast injected to confirm position.

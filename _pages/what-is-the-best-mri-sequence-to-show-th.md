title: "What is the best MRI sequence to show the cranial nerves in the posterior fossa?"
---
Answer: Steady-state GRE sequences
Short acquisition times, high SNR, and better contrast to noise ratio in CISS foster its utility.
Also good for evaluating cystic lesiosn in teh spine and brain.

Routine SE imaging with T2 and T2 can show the CNs, but with low contrast.

title: "Tc-MDP: uptake in skull sutures, breasts, kidneys (normal and abnormal)"
---
Skull sutures: some uptake is normal.
-Marked uptake suggests renal osteodystrophy.

Breast uptake: mild, diffuse uptake is normal (especially in younger women)
-Focal uptake can be cancer.

Kidneys: renal uptake is normal
-Renal cortex hotter than L-spine: think about hemochromatosis
-Diffuse renal uptake: may occur in setting of chemotherapy or urinary obstruction.

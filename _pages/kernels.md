title: "Kernels"
---
These are mathematical reconstructions that make a decision between image noise and image spatial resolution

Smooth Kernel - this is going to have minimal noise but sacrafice spatial resolution (think brain)
Sharp Kernel - this is going to have increased resolution but with increased noise (think bone)

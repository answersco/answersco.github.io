title: "IMPORTANT: In fMRI BOLD imaging, how does T2* effect get altered by more oxygenation?"
---
T2<b> effects are lessened with increased local venous oxygenation (more OxyHb to shield the Hb iron atoms and reduce the dephasing of adjacent protons). Therefore, neuronal activation where there's more OxyHb results in higher signal on T2</b>

OxyHb is diamagnetic (no unpaired electrons!).

title: "Rectal cancer"
---
-adeno &gt;&gt; squamous (HPV)
-mesorectal excision
-MRI for staging
-stage T3: invasion into perirectal fat

Nearly ALWAYS adenocarcinoma (remember some HPV associated can be squamous cell)
Total mesorectal excision is standard surgical therapy 
LOWER rectal cancer: 0-5 cm from the anorectal angle have the highest rate of recurrence 
MRI is used to stage: you really only need T2 weighted images. Most important stage is T3! This is where the tumor breaks out of the rectum and into the perirectal fat. This CHANGES management as these people will also get chemorads PRIOR to surgery 
NOTE: Perirectal lymph nodes are considered ABNORMAL if they are &gt;5 mm

Important information about lymph drainage from rectum:
1. Lower rectal goes SYSTEM, i.e., through iliac vein portosystemic shunts I believe THEREFORE more likely to see mets in the LUNGS
2. Upper rectal goes PORTAL, i.e., through the IMV and therefore you are more likely to see LIVER mets

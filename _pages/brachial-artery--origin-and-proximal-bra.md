Brachial artery begins lateral to teres major muscle tendon
-Variants of brachial artery proper are uncommon, but include a small accessory branch to radial artery (persistent superficial brachial artery) and duplication.

Profunda brachialis: usually the 1st major branch, traveling with the ulnar nerve in posterolateral course around humerus.

Many unnamed muscular branches- anastomose to muscular branches distal to elbow joint (named collateral vessels).

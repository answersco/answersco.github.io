Breast Milk:
1) genes that encode milk proteins and certain enzymes are transcribed into mRNA
2) mRNA exits through nuclear pores
3) mRNA moves to surface of rough ER, where proteins are synthesized on ribosomes using amino acids in the cytoplasm
4) lipids are synthesized in the smooth ER
5) Sugars are synthesized and proteins folded in the golgi apparatus, then both are released in vesicles that bud off of the golgi apparatus
6) protein and sugar-laden vesicles move to the plasma membrane to release; fat droplets pick up a layer of lipid from the plasma membrane as the exit the cell

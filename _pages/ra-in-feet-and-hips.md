RA in the feet:
Typically involves the MTP joints in the forefoot and the talocalcaneonavicular joint in the midfoot.
Up to 20% have MTP joint as the first site of involvement.

RA in the hip:
RA causes concentric acetabular cartilage loss, leading to axial migration of the femoral head. In contrast, OA more commonly causes superior acetabular cartilage space narrowing and superolateral femoral head migration.
In severe cases, RA may cause protrusion deformity:
&gt; 3 mm medial deviation of the femoral head beyond the ilioischial line in males, &gt; 6 mm in females.

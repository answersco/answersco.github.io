title: "Technique for primary placement of a button gastrostomy (balloon-retention type)"

-14, 16, and 18-French gastrostomy button catheters can be placed radiologically with similar prep as before normal gastrostomy.
-T-fastener gastropexy is mandatory for button gastrostomy.
-Accurate measurement of tract length is essential.
-Tract length measured using an angioplasty balloon catheter or guidewire. Using guidewire, image in lateral position while guidewire is pulled back, kinking wire for measurement. Generally a button is chosen that is 5 mm longer than the measured tract length.
-Tract is dilated using either a balloon catheter or serial fascial dilators. Dilate 4-French sizes higher than desired button (e.g. dilate to 18 French for a 14-French button).

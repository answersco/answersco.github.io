title: "Delta Ray?"

Aka Secondary ionization results when the e- initially ejected from the atom is given enough kinetic energy to cause additional ionization events in the absorber. This process is known as secondary ionization, and the ejected e- are called delta rays. May result from e- ejected in either photoelectron, compton scatter e-, or Auger e-.

title: "What are intramural pseudodiverticula of the esophagus? Classic imaging appearance?"
---
intramural pseudodiverticulosis, a degenerative condition of unknown pathogenesis, though it is clearly associated with chronic reflux and appear as innumerable tiny, flask-like outpouchings from the esophageal lumen that fill with barium. The openings into the esophageal lumen are so narrow as to be invisible, making the collection of barium appear to &quot;float&quot; within the wall of the esophagus.

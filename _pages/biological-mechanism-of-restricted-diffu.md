title: "Biological mechanism of restricted diffusion in cerebral ischemia?"
---
Acute cerebral ischemia&#8594; if the cerebral blood flow is &#8595;, the cell membrane ion pump fails&#8594; excess Na enters the cell
This is followed by a net movement of water from the extracellular (EC) to the intracellular (IC) compartment &#8594; resulting in cytotoxic edema.
Relative to the EC space, diffusion of the IC water molecules is restricted by IC organelles &#8594; this restricted diffusion results in &#8595; ADC and &#8593; signal intensity on DWI

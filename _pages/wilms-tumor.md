title: "Wilms Tumor"
---
Large, heterogeneous renal mass extending into renal vein and inferior vena cava (IVC)
Ultrasound frequently 1st exam performed
CT and MR are useful to better visualize entire mass and supplement sonography (often required by treatment protocols)
10-20% of children have lung metastases at time of diagnosis (peak = 3 years)
Chest x-ray or CT used for staging
Contralateral kidney should be closely scrutinized for synchronous tumor or nephrogenic rests
Renal vein and IVC should be closely evaluated for bland or tumor thrombus

&gt;1yr, look for invasion of renal vein

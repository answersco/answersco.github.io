title: "NM testicular imaging"

Primary question = torsion vs other causes of pain (e.g. epididymitis)
Tracer = sodium pertechnetate

Normal = symmetric low-level flow
Acute (early) torsion: focal absence of flow to affected side (&quot;nubbin sign&quot;).
Delayed (late) torsion: AKA missed torsion
-Halo of increased activity with central photopenia.

Testicular abscess = identical to delayed torsion (halo of increased activity with central photopenia).

Acute epididymitis = increased flow and blood pool to affected side.

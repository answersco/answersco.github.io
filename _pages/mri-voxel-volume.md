title: "MRI voxel volume"
---
Voxel volume = slice thickness x (FOVPhase / Matrix SizePhase) x (FOVRead/Matrix SizeRead)
&#8593; FOV, &#8593; slice thickness, and &#8595; matrix size&#8594; &#8593; voxel volume
&#8593; frequency and slice-select gradient strengths result in &#8595; voxel volume
&#8595; voxel volume&#8594; leads to &#8593; potential spatial resolution
&#8595; voxel volume also results in &#8595; SNR and &#8595; pixel size

Thus &#8593; matrix size, &#8595; FOV, and &#8595; slice thickness lead to &#8593; potential spatial resolution

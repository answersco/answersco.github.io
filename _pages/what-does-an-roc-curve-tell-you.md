title: "What does an ROC curve tell you?"
---
Y-axis = sensitivity (True positive rate)
X-axis = 1-specificty (False positive rate)

- Perfect test will have an area under curve of 1.0 (top left of ROC curve)

- Random chance or &quot;no predictive value&quot; curve (when the 1-specificty = sensitivity; e.g. both 50%)

title: "Healing of fractures"
---
1) Hematoma formation: the hematoma is converted to granulation tissue by invasion of cells and blood capillaries

2) Soft callus formation: deposition of collagen and fibrocartilage converts granulation tissue to a soft callus

3) Hard callus formation: osteoblasts deposit a temporary bony collar around the fracture to unite the broken pieces while ossification occur

4) Bone remodeling: small bone fragments are removed by osteoclasts, while osteoblasts deposit spongy bone and then convert it to compact bone

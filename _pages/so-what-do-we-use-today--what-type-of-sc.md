title: "So what do we use today, what type of screens, and why?"

Rare earth screens. They are faster than calcium tunstate because of a higher absorption efficiency at the x-ray energies normally used in radiology. They also have a higher conversion efficiencies, producing more light for a given amount of deposited x-ray energy.

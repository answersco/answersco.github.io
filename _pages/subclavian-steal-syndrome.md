title: "Subclavian steal syndrome"
---
Remember this is referring to a proximal stenosis within the subclavian

The attached graph is showing the spectral data on how you can see steal progress

Note the EARLY STEAL phenomina where you have bunny ears of the waveform

Subclavian steal syndrome: proximal stenosis or occlusion of the subclavian artery, which leads to retrograde flow from the vertebral artery into the subclavian artery distal to the flow-limiting lesion.
Presents with vertebrobasilar insufficiency or syncope exacerbated by arm exercise. May occasionally be signs of brachial artery insufficiency, such as extremity coolness or even fingertip necrosis.
Best diagnosed with angiography: 
Early arterial phase: shows the proximal subclavian flow-limiting lesion
Later arterial phase: shows retrograde flow from the vertebral artery into the subclavian
Treatment: surgical bypass or angioplasty of the flow-limiting lesion.

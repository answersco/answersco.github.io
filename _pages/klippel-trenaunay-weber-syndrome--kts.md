title: "Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome (KTS)"
---
Triad of port-wine nevi, bony or soft tissue hypertrophy (localized gigantism), and a venous malformation.
Common associated persistent sciatic vein
Marginal vein of Servelle (superficial vein in lateral calf, like a GSV on wrong side) is pathognomonic
See lots of superficial vessels and no deep drainage
20% have GI involvement and can bleed.
If large enough, the vascular malformation can eat up platelets (Kasabach-Merritt)
Often combined with Parkes-Weber syndrome: true high-flow AVM.

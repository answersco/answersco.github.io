This usually invovles the antimesenteric side of the colon
Look for early venous filling and a tangle of vessels
Angiodysplasia is associated with AORTIC STENOSIS

an avm with characteristic tuft of vessel appearance

elderly, ESRD, right colon bleed, treated endoscopically.

Angiodysplasia: common cause of chronic intermittent LGI bleeding, most commonly in right colon or cecum.
Imaging: even when angiodysplasia is the cause of bleeding, active extravasation is rarely seen.
Appears as a tangle of vessels with early filling of the antimesenteric draining vein.
Typical tram-track appearance: caused by simultaneous opacification of the parallel artery and vein.
Endovascular treatments (e.g. vasopressin or embolization) are generally not effective due to the abnormal vessels in angiodysplasia.
Treatment is endoscopy with electrocoagulation, laser therapy, or surgery if uncontrollable/recurrent.

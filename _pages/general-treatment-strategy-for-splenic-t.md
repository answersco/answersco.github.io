Grade I and II lesions are typically managed conservatively, though delayed rupture can occur in up to 1/3.

Selective embo addresses the point of injury and preserves splenic tissue, but risks focal infarction

Embo of the main splenic artery is thought to reduce bleeding by decreasing the arterial pressure in the splenic pulp, while avoiding splenic infarction due to preservation of collateral blood supply.

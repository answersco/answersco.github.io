title: "Endovascular options for treating chronic LE venous obstruction"
---
Endovascular reconstruction of occluded venous segments with metallic stents is preferred over surgery due to minimal morbidity and high success rates.
-Both antegrade and retrograde approaches should be attempted. 
-Jugular access provides excellent leverage for crossing CIV occlusions
-Antegrade recanalization may require access from below the CFV.
-Trial of thrombolysis can be beneficial in patients with suspected mixed acute and chronic thrombosis, but most IRs will angioplasty and then place stents.
-Patients with central venous obstruction often have concomitant superficial venous reflux. Additional of endovenous ablation of abnormal GSVs can improve overall symptoms in these patients.

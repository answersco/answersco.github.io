title: "Cesare Bonesana Beccaria"
---
This philosopher's ideas greatly influenced criminal law reformers in Europe and North America. He argued that laws existed to preserve social order, not avenge crimes and that governments should seek the greatest good for the greatest number of people. He argued against the use of torture and in favor of rational, equitable laws in which the punishment fits the crime.

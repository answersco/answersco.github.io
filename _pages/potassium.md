title: "Potassium"
---
-mostly in ICF
-cation
-essential for normal cardiac, neural, and muscle function
-normal serum value: 3.5-5.0 mEq/L

3.5-5.0 mmol/L
-most abundant positive electrolyte in intracellular fluid
-important for nerve impulse conduction and muscle contraction, greatly affects heart
-hypokalemia is not enough potassium in the blood that can be due to removal of fluids especially GI fluids (vomited, diarrhea, NG tube, ABD surgery) -- causes muscle weakness, potential life threatening EKG changes, decreased GI motility
-hyperkalemia can be due to burns and renal/liver failure, reduces contractility of the heart -- causes GI hypermobility

title: "Nutrient foramina: lucencies extending through cortex with straight parallel margins. Usually extend away from joint central to periphery. &#8226; Scalloping of medial distal fibula: this finding may be confused with a buckle fracture or superficial bone destruction. &#8226; Serpentine physes may appear as lucencies suggesting fracture. &#8226; Distal femoral cortical irregularity: posteromedial metaphysis &#8226; Apophyses of the inferior pubic ramus: these apophyses often ossify asymmetrically. &#8226; Dense metaphyseal bands affecting zone of provisional calcification; most common 2 to 6 years of age. &#8226; Calcaneal apophyses: normally denser than adjacent bone; frequently fragmented &#8226; Calcaneal pseudocyst"

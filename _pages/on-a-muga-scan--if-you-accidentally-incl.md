title: "On a MUGA scan, if you accidentally include the spleen and falsely elevate the amount of background, how does it affect your EF?"

Falsely elevates EF (normal EF 50-65%)

EF = (EDV - ESV/EDV - background)
* The background is subtracted out of the denominator effectively, so it falsely decreases the denominator, thereby falsely increasing EF.

Basically, you effectively think that you're &quot;ejecting out&quot; part of the spleen via the heart, when that's of course not true!

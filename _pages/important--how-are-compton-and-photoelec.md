title: "IMPORTANT: How are Compton and Photoelectric related to kV (energy)?"
---
Both are INVERSELY proportional, but photoelectric is more so.

Compton ~ 1/E

Photoelectric ~ 1/E^3

Therefore, when you're above the k-edge and you increase energy of the beam, you get LESS Compton overall, but MUCH LESS photoelectric

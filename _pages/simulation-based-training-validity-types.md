title: "Simulation-based training validity types: face validity, construct validity, and content validity"
---
Face validity: similarity between simulator and real-life objects
Construct validity: ability of the simulator to differentiate the operators of different levels of expertise
Content validity: ability of simulator to teach or assess desired knowledge

Concurrent validity: correlation of results of simulation with other measure of assessment
Discriminant validity: distinction of results of simulation from measures of assessment
Predictive validity: correlation between performance on simulator with performance in real clinical scenarios.

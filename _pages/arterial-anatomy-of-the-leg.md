Femoral artery is the continuation of the EIA distal to the inguinal ligament
Branches:
Deep femoral artery: terminal branch to supply the deep muscles of the thigh
Superficial circumflex iliac artery
Superficial femoral artery (SFA): continues to supply the leg and foot
After passing through the adductor hiatus, SFA becomes the popliteal artery
Popliteal artery branches (from medial to lateral)
Posterior tibial artery (most medial) &#8594; gives off plantar arteries
Peroneal artery (arises from tibioperoneal trunk)
Anterior tibial artery (most lateral, also from tibioperoneal trunk) &#8594; gives off dorsalis pedis.

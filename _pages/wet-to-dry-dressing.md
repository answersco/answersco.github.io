title: "Wet to dry dressing"
---
-mechanical debridement with removal of the dressing - put gauze in wet, 8-12 hours later when gauze is removed, gauze is dry and pulls away the dead tissue - very painful
-common in deep wounds requiring packing
-moisten gauze/rolled 
-opened and fluffed
-cover with DSD
-wet to moist dressing includes not letting it dry out so it is done more frequently, used to retain moisture of a deep wound that does not need debriding

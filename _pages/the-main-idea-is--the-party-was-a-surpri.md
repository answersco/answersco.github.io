title: "The main idea is: The party was a surprise."

Yesterday was my birthday. My mom said we didn't have time to plan something big so we were going to go out to eat instead. She said we would go to Chucky Cheese because she knew how much I liked it there. When we got there, we went to the back and there were so many of my friends and family! I couldn't believe she planned a party without me knowing.

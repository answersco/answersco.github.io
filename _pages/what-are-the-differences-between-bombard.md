title: "What are the differences between bombardment via nuclear reactor vs cyclotron?"
---
Nuclear reactor = strike target elements with neutrons
- not carrier free = have to clean up left over parent element


Cyclotron = strike target elements with charged particles (alpha particles, protons, deuterons)
- transmutation means it IS carrier free (don't have to clean up the parent)

title: "Papillary necrosis"
---
- diabetes
- analgesic nephropathy
- pyelonephritis (esp. TB)

= sickle cell anemia
= urinary obstruction
= renal vein thrombosis

Mnemonic for papillary necrosis

AD SPORT C (causes in order of incidence)
A : analgesic abuse (phenacetin, NSAID's, paracetamol: especially in combination)
D : diabetes mellitus
S : sickle cell disease
P : pyelonephritis (especially in children)
O : obstruction
R : renal vein thrombosis
T : renal tuberculosis (not usually confined to papillae)
C : cirrhosis

Postcards
P : pyelonephritis
O : obstruction
S : sickle cell disease
T : tuberculosis
C : cirrhosis
A : analgesic abuse
R : renal vein thrombosis
D : diabetes mellitus
S : systemic vasculitis/des

Ischemic necrosis of renal papillae, most commonly involving medullary pyramids. May see filling defects in calcyces.

DM is #1 cause.
Other causes: pyelonephritis (esp kids), sickle cell, TB, analgesic use, venous thrombosis, and cirrhosis.

Lobster-claw sign: appearance of a necrotic cavity in the papillae with linear streaks of contrast inside the calyx.

See image for specific imaging signs 

Causes can include
1. Sickle cell disease (50% patients develop)
2. Analegesia
3. Cirrhosis
4. Pyelonephritis 
5. TB (most common extrapulmonary location is the kidney)

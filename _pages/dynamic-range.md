title: "Dynamic Range:"
---
small perceived as &quot;noise&quot; and large &quot;saturation&quot;
operator adjustable
-smaller range- steep- more contrast- more noise- better conspicuity.

This is the range of exposure intensities that that can be accurately detected by a film system 
Digital xray has LINEAR response to exposure with LARGER dynamic range 
Film xray has CURVILINEAR response to exposure with SMALLER dynamic range

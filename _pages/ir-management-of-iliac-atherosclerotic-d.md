Iliac atherosclerotic (AS) disease
PTA: treatment of choice for noncalcified, concentric iliac stenoses &lt; 3 cm in length (Type A)
Lesions between 3 and 10 cm in length (Types B and C): either PTA or surgery could be performed (though TASC-II guidelines advocate surgery)
PTA has only a limited role in treating stenoses &gt; 10 cm (Type D) or occlusions &gt; 5 cm after thrombolysis.
Subsequent to angioplasty, stenting is indicated if there is &gt; 30% residual stenosis or 10 mmHg systolic pressure gradient at rest.

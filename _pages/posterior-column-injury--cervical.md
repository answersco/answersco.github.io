title: "Posterior Column Injury, Cervical"
---
Posterior column injury seen as component of many mechanisms of cervical spine injury
Posterior column failure in compression
Hyperextension with axial compression
Lamina fractures
Fracture, compression of articular facet(s), pillar(s)
Hyperflexion with axial compression
Disruption of interspinous ligament: Widening of interspinous distance
Distraction of facet joints
Lateral flexion injury
Crushing fracture of articular pillar &amp;/or facet on direction of flexion
Posterior column failure in tension
Hyperflexion with distraction
Disruption of interspinous ligament: Widening of interspinous distance
Diastatic (&gt; 2 mm), subluxed (articular apposition &lt; 50%), perched, or jumped facet joints
Lateral flexion injury
Facet diastasis on side opposite direction of flexion
Posterior column failure in shear
Fracture-dislocation, hyperextension or hyperflexion injuries with rotational component
Horizontal fracture or fracture-dislocation of facet joints
Fractures of articular pillar, pedicle, lamina

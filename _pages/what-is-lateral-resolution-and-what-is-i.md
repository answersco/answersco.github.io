title: "What is lateral resolution and what is it dependent on?"
---
Lateral resolution is determined by the beam diameter. The diameter decreases with increasing depth in the near field, being the smallest at the junction between near and far field (about 1.2 the transducer diameter, ie Fresnel zone) and increases with increasing depth in the far field. Lateral resolution can be changed by not activating all transducer elements at one time, decreasing the effective transducer diameter. In addition, transmit and receive focusing allows to maximize lateral resolution. The focal zone is indicated by a little triangle at the side of the image and can be changed by the user.

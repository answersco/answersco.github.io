title: "Beta Plus (electron capture)"

This is where you also want to give away positive to become more negative or neutral but you DO NOT have 1.02 MeV to spare
Here a K shell electron is pulled into the nucleus (this is still ISOBARIC) and GIVEN TO A PROTON (generates another neutron)
This typically leads to a METASTABLE compound that still needs to give off energy to become truly stable. NOTE metastable state (ISOBARIC) does not only occur in beta plus but also the other forms of decay
The nucleus then gives of energy as GAMMA RAYS in a process called ISOMERIC transformation

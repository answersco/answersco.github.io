title: "CT pitch:"
---
Typical pitch values range between 0.5 and 2.0
Pitch &gt; 1 &#8594; x-ray beams are not contiguous for adjacent rotations, i.e. there are gaps between the x-ray beams resulting in areas that aren't irradiated.
Results in &#8595; radiation dose but also &#8595; image quality (via fewer projections obtained&#8594; &#8595; SNR)
Pitch &lt; 1 &#8594; there will be an overlap of turns&#8594; some areas of the body will be radiated twice, once by the leading edge of the beam and once by the trailing edge of the beam
Pitch values &lt; 1.0 produce over-sampling
Results in &#8593; image quality but at &#8593; patient dose

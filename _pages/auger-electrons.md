title: "Auger electrons"
---
Energy released form the filling of an inner shell vacancy by an outer shell electron is imparted to another electron (instead of being emitted as a photon), which is then ejected- the 2nd electron = Auger electron

No x-rays emitted

Heavy elements more likely to emit x-rays 
Lighter elements more likely to emit Auger electrons.

This is the process by which in ionization the ejected INNER SHELL electron hits an outer shell electron and the outer shell electron is ejected. There is NO xray production with auger electrons.

As the Z goes up, there is a higher likelihood of producing charactersitics xrays
As Z goes down, higher prob of producing auger electrons

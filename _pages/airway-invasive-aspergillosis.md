Airway-invasive aspergillosis: seen only in the immunocompromised, with spectrum of disease ranging from bronchiolitis to bronchopneumonia
CT: centrilobular and tree-in-bud nodules are main CT findings
When bronchopneumonia is present, XR and CT findings are indistinguishable from other causes of bronchopneumonia, such as staph aureus.

title: "Process of oogenesis"
---
1) oogonium (2n = 46 single chromosomes)
2) after oogonium goes through mitosis, it becomes a primary oocyte arrested in Pro I of meiosis until onset of puberty (2n = 46 double chromosomes)
3) after meiosis I, 1 polar body and 1 secondary oocyte are formed; arrested at Meta II until fertilized (1n = 23 double chromosomes, reduction)
4) after meiosis II, there is 1 ovum and 3 polar bodies (1n = 23 single chromosomes)

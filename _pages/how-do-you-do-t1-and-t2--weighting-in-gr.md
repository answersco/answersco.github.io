title: "How do you do T1 and T2* weighting in GRE?"
---
T1 = use a Spoiler gradient &quot;SpoilT1&quot; to get rid of residual transverse mag (T2) that persists in the steady state. This occurs due to the TR of the study being shorter than the T1 and T2 of the tissues.
- uses Larger Flip Angles

T2<b> = use a &quot;rewind gradient&quot; to cause T2</b> weighting
- ex) SSFP in cardiac (bright blood, fast, with high SNR) &quot;GRIght blood&quot;
- T2* Uses Shorter TE times than GRE T2 (duh)

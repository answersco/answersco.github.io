title: "Partial Volume Averaging Artifact"
---
-Occurs when multiple tissue types are contained within a single voxel.
-Thicker Slices contribute more heavily to Partial Volume Averaging
-Most often occurs in the SLICE SELECT DIRECTION of the image

can be minimize by...
-DECREASE PIXEL- decrease FOV, increase, matrix, decrease in the voxel volume
-Thinner slices (easiest solution)

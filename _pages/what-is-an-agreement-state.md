title: "What is an agreement state?"
---
Any state with which the Atomic Energy Commission has entered into an effective agreement under subsection 274b of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) does not release all authority to Agreement States. The majority of the US is made up of Agreement States. An Agreement State can enact more strict criteria than the NRC.

title: "B. Pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade. There is a large amount of fluid in the pericardial sac (arrows). This fluid is physiologically significant because the contractile function of the heart is compromised and there is diastolic collapse of multiple chambers. The fluid is within the pericardium surrounding the heart, thus excluding pericardial cyst. The pericardium is not thickened, essentially excluding constrictive pericarditis. This diagnosis is usually made with echocardiography. Bilateral pleural effusions are also present."

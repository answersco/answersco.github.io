title: "How does the magnitude of voltage in gas filled detectors effect their detection efficiency?"
---
If too little voltage, then the ion pairs produced recombine and are never registered, thus reducing the efficiency. If too high voltage, then ions are produced by the voltage. If volate is high enough the ions created have enough kinetic energy to cause secondary ionizations.

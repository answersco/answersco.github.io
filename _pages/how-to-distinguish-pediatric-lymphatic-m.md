title: "How to distinguish pediatric lymphatic malformation vs venous vs arterial malformation vs infantile hemangioma?"
---
Infantile Hemangioma = 1st year of life; Classic skin finding, not present at birth but then grows fast, may have high flow vessels (e.g. arteries) and intense enhancement; NO fluid fluid levels


Venous Malformation = Look for PHLEBOLITHS, (no arterial flow), lobular multiseptated lesion with fluid fluid levels and small thrombi

Lymphatic Malformation = Macrocystic T2, infiltrative, NO or just RIM ENHANCEMENT, possible fluid fluid levels


Arterial Malformation = Big flow voids; no discrete mass

title: "DHE imaging of acute and chronic infarcts, and findings suggesting severe acute infarct"
---
DHE is seen in both acute and chronic infarcts &#8594; both will have corresponding wall-motion abnormalities in the involved regions.

Acute infarcts: may show &#8593; T2 signal due to edema

Severe acute infarct: may see a non-enhancing area of subendocardium surrounded by an area of enhancement &#8594; due to microvascular obstruction (MO) and subsequent necrosis
The finding usually resolves by 2 weeks, leaving only an area of DHE
The presence of MO on DHE imaging indicates poor prognosis

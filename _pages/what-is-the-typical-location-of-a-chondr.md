title: "What is the typical location of a chondroblastoma?"
---
In the epiphysis or epiphyseal equivalents of bone, and growth may extend into the metaphysis.
-Commonly extensive surrounding bone marrow edema around this otherwise well-circumscribed lesion.

Geographic lytic lesion
1/3 to 1/2 contain chondroid matrix
Sclerotic margin in majority
Eccentrically located within epiphysis
Larger and more longstanding lesions develop smooth thick periosteal reaction (50%)
Lesion occasionally contains fluid levels (occasionally represents 2&#176; aneurysmal bone cyst)
MR: Inhomogeneously low signal on T1; inhomogeneously high signal intensity on fluid-sensitive sequences
High signal on fluid-sensitive sequences in adjacent cortex, marrow, and soft tissue in majority of cases

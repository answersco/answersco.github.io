-treat as being of worth
-respect all pt's and colleagues

-patient dignity is the foundation of nursing ethics.
-dignity is inherent, not &quot;earned.&quot;
-a patient never loses dignity, e.g., when comatose, delirious, frail, or in an altered state.
-a nurse must approach every patient with respect for dignity, regardless of personal attributes, health state, or any other situational or patient variable.

title: "Mucocele?"
---
Expanded airless sinus resulting from obstruction of sinus ostia. Usually secondary to inflammatory sinus disease. Can be secondary to tumor.

Mucocele&#8594; expanded, airless sinus that results from obstruction of the sinus ostia.
May be secondary to inflammatory sinus disease (most common) or tumor
Imaging: thinning of the sinus walls.
Contents tend to be homogeneous on CT and MR&#8594; however MRI signal is variable depending on the degree of desiccation of the sinus contents.
Specifically, with &#8593; chronicity, signal &#8593; on T1 and &#8595; on T2-weighted images.
Late disease&#8594; there can markedly &#8595; T2 signal that may simulate a normal air-filled sinus.

-post-traumatic --&gt; disruption of sinus outflow tract
-airless expanded sinus
-frontal &gt; ethmoid
T1 signal is VARIABLE dpeending on water vs protein content

Efficiency: the degree to which a process produces the desired effect with a minimum of waste, cost, and unnecessary effort. 
Efficiency adds an economic component to the evaluation of a technology.

energy extracted from molecule by enzymes / total energy of molecule

EX. C6H12O6 + 6O2 = 6CO2 + 6H2O + 2927 KJ

C6H12O6 ---(glycolysis, TCA,O/P---&gt; CO2 + H2O + 34 ATP

34 ATP x 50 = 1700 KJ

1700 KJ / 2927 KJ x 100% = 58.08%

-this takes billions of years

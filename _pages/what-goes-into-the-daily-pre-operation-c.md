title: "What goes into the daily pre-operation checking of a Geiger Muller Counter?"
---
- Check the calibration date (should be within 1 year)
- Check the battery
- Perform a source response check (usually with a sealed Cesium 137 source on the side of the instrument) *Placed directly against the counter instead of the standard 4 cm away

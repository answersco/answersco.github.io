Kinetic energy released in matter. Most meters are calibrated to KERMA air.

Kinetic energy released in matter. Most meters are calibrated to KERMA air. It takes all forms of ionizing radiation into account.

Kinetic energy released in matter
The AIR kerma is going to be the energy within the photons right before they hit the patient
Low energy photons: KERMA will EQUAL the absorbed dose (photoelectric effects dominate)
HIGH energy photons: KERMA will be GREATER than absorbed dose (many of the highly energetic photons pass completely through the patient)

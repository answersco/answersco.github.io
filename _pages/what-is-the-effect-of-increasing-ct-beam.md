title: "What is the effect of increasing CT beam-width in the z-direction while keeping pitch constant?"

It will decrease scan time (larger coverage with 1 revolution of the x-ray tube/detector) and thus may reduce motion artifact. It has no effect on radiation dose, but it increases partial volume effects (beam becomes more divergent).

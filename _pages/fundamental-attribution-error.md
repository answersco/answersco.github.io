title: "Fundamental attribution error"
---
people tend to overestimate the importance of stable, internal traits and underestimate the importance of temporary, external situations when seeking explanations for others' behaviors

EX. paper not done in time&gt; too bad, your lazy and irresponsible but when they could realize something came up that came in the way of finishing the paper

a common error that skews the ways in which people explain human behaviors in that we all tend to use a &quot;dispositional&quot; explanation of events as opposed to an explanation based on context

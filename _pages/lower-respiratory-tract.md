Lungs:

1) Pleura: 
-serous membrane; includes visceral and parietal pleura
-in-between these layers is a chemical called surfactant that allows lungs to inhale and exhale without friction

2) Mediastinum: 
-covers the lungs, the heart, the thymus, aorta, vena cava, and esophagus

3) Bronchi, bronchioles

4) Alveoli: 
-over 300 million alveoli; cover surface area of lungs
--Type 1: 95% are for surface area
--Type 2: produce type 1 alveoli cells and surfactant 

5) Macrophages: 
-ingest foreign material as a defense mechanism

*<b>Function: Responsible for gas exchange</b>*

1) structures:
-lungs
-pleura, mediastinum, lobes
-bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli
2) responsible for:
-gas exchange

CT findings
 SB wall may be thick or thinned
Mucosal hyperenhancement accompanies active ulceration
Reversal of jejunoileal fold patterns (atrophied jejunal, thickened ileal)
Submucosal edema, fat, or gas
Small bowel intussusception
Eccentric soft tissue density mass in bowel wall (tumor)
Mesenteric adenopathy (may be cavitated)
Excess fluid within SB lumen
Conformation of flaccid SB segments
Distends lumen and dilutes contrast medium
Colonic luminal dilation
Excess gas, fluid, fat within lumen
Eccentric soft tissue density mass in bowel wall
Strongly suggests lymphoma or carcinoma
Look for a dilated small bowel with decreased folds in the jejunum and signs of malabsorption. Correlate with clinical evidence of gluten intolerance.

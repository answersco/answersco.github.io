Chance fracture: 3 column injury
Horizontal fracture of the pedicles extending into the body &#8594; splits pedicles into superior and inferior components with a horizontal fracture line.
Another pattern is vertebral body compression and anterior displacement of the spine above the fracture with facet subluxation.
This process may also involve primarily soft tissues and extend through the disc and interspinous ligaments.

Best diagnostic clue
Wedging anterior vertebral body and posterior element fracture &amp;/or increased intraspinous distance (ligamentous injury)
Location
Usually occurs from T11-L3 levels
78% occur between T12 and L2 levels
Occasionally at midthoracic spine
May have anterior injury at one level, posterior injury at adjacent one

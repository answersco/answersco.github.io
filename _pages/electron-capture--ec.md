title: "Electron Capture (EC)?"
---
Alternative to Beta + decay. An e- is captured by a Z and converted to a N + a neutrino. In general, the probability of positron emission is higher than that of EC for lighter elements, while among heavier elements, the probability of EC is higher than that of positron emission. This is because in heavy elements, orbital electrons tend to be closer to the nucleus and hence are more easily captured. The child nucleus can have extra energy and undergo a Gamma decay or CE. Additionally the inner shell vacancy is filled by an outer shell e-, which produces a characteristic xray ( or Auger e-).

Origin anomalies: may be always malignant (if arising from the pulmonary artery) or potentially malignant (depending on the course).

Coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery: malignant. Either the left or right main coronary artery may arise from PA, but both are very rare
-Anomalous left coronary artery from the PA (ALCAPA): AKA Bland-White-Garland syndrome. 
90% mortality in 1st year if untreated. Surgical treatment usually either direct implantation of anomalous coronary artery (children) or ligation of anomalous vessel in conjunction with bypass grafting (adults).
-Anomalous RCA from the PA (ARCAPA)
-RCA arising from left coronary sinus&#8594; malignant when it passes between the aorta and PA
-Left main coronary artery (LMCA) arising from right coronary sinus&#8594; malignant if it passes between the aorta and PA.
-LCX or LAD arising from right coronary sinus
-Any artery arising from noncoronary sinus.

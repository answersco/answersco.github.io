title: "Gadolinium in pregnancy:"

Gadolinium is relatively contraindicated in pregnancy, as it can pass through placental barrier, enter fetal circulation, become filtered by fetal kidneys, and excreted amniotic fluid, where they remain for a long period of time and potentially dissociate into toxic gadolinium ion.

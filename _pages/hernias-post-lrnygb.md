Factors that promote internal hernia after bypass: laparoscopic (more common than open), and greater weight loss

3 potential sites:
1. At defect in transverse mesocolon, through which the Roux-limb passes (if it's done in retrocolic position)
2. At mesenteric defect at enteroenterostomy.
3. Behind the Roux limb mesentery placed in a retrocolic or antecolic position (retrocolic Petersen and antecolic Petersen types).

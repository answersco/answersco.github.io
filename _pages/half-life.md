title: "Half life"
---
= ln (2)/ decay constant

-time for excretion to lower the concentration of a dose by half
-measured through blood work

-the time it takes for the amount of the drug in the body to decrease to one half of the peak level
-this is important to know for drug dosing and schedules
-drugs with longer half lives will have a longer duration of action
-longer duration = less frequent dosing times and increased risk of danger 

Example:
You have a patient who takes acetaminophen 500mg at 12:00 and the half life is 4 hours, how much drug will remain in your system after 12 hours? (divide by two)
12:00 - 500 mg
16:00 (4 hours later) - 250 mg 
20:00 (8 hours later) - 125 mg
00:00 (12 hours later) - 62.5 mg (the answer)

-time taken to reduce the radioactivity by 50%

EX. 
1) 32/15 P ---&gt; P-32 --&gt; 14.3 days
2) 14/6 C ---&gt; C-14 --&gt; 5730 years

time for a radioactive isotope to reduce to half its original amount

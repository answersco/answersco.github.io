title: "Collateral pathways in occlusion of the proximal SVA"
---
Proximal occlusion of the SFA: results in hypertrophy of PFA branches, which in turn reconstitute the SFA via muscular branches in the thigh.

Distal SFA occlusion: the descending trunk of the PFA provides collateral flow to the popliteal artery through the lateral genicular arteries.

Occlusion of the above-knee popliteal artery can be collateralized from both the distal SFA (via the descending genicular artery) and the PFA.
Below-knee popliteal occlusion: sural and genicular arteries can reconstitute the tibial arteries.

Occlusion of the tibioperoneal trunk and the PT arteries results in collateral supply from the sural and genicular arteries.

Each of the tibial arteries has the potential to provide collateral supply to the others.
The peroneal artery is the most common source of collateral supply, in that it is frequently spared in occlusive disease and occupies a central location in the calf.
At the calf, the peroneal artery has a constant bifurcation that can collateralize to the distal AT or PT.

Occlusion of either the DP or the PT distal to the medial malleolus is well tolerated if the plantar arches are intact.
Occlusion of both the proximal DP and the inframalleolar PT is collateralized by tarsal and metatarsal arteries.

title: "AVM imaging findings"
---
-Contrast MR is best non-invasive imaging tool
-Diffuse mass of dilated tortuous serpiginous vessels involving both arteries and veins
-Contrast filling of dilated feeding arteries and draining veins in arterial phase (early frames of TR MRA images) in high flow AVMs
-TE MRA (for flow dynamics, high vs, low), high resolution CE-MRA (to assess vascular details), and post-contrast T1WI GRE (to assess for extent and intraluminal fillling defects of AVM)
-Best diagnostic clue: \\\&quot;bag of black worms\\\&quot; (flow voids) on spin-echo MR
-Angio: enlarged feeding artery and numerous arterial venous connections around nidus, early venous drainage, rapid venous washout, no contrast retention/pooling

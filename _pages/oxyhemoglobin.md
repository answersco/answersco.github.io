title: "Oxyhemoglobin"
---
-O2 is nonpolar, does not dissolve readily in blood plasma (1.5% at most)
-Hb carries oxygen, producing oxyhemoglobin (Hb-O2)
-each Hb contains 4 heme groups- Fe atom that can bind O2
-binding one O2 encourages binding more -- heme is permissive 
-even when O2 is &quot;dropped off&quot;, &#190; of hemoglobin still binds O2

3D MRI Technique
Slices imaged in a 3D stack undergo RF excitation and RF detection simultaneously.
The &quot;slice-select&quot; gradient is used twice in 3D techniques:
First = &quot;slab select&quot; &#8594; used to excite tissues in all slices.
Second = &quot;slice select&quot; &#8594; used to spatially encode each slice with a unique set of phases and frequencies.
Image weighting can be controlled by preparatory inversion pulses.

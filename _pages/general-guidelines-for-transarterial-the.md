No absolute guidelines.
General guidelines include:
Child-Pugh score of A or B
Total bili &lt; 2 mg/dL
Absence of extrahepatic mets
&lt;50% replacement of liver by tumor
Good overall functional status
Lesion or lesions not amenable to surgical resection/transplant/ablation
Life expectancy &gt; 6 months

Patients with indwelling biliary tubes, biliary obstruction, or biliary-enteric anastomoses are at increased risk for post-embo liver abscess and require pre- and post-procedure Abx.

Occlusion of portal vein by tumor or tumor thrombus is not a contraindication, but carries higher risk of liver infarction with generalized lobar embo. These patients can undergo selective embo with an agent that won't be shunted into the vein, often showing regression of tumor thrombus.

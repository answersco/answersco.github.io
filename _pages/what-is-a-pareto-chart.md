title: "What is a Pareto Chart?"
---
Prioritization exercise (rank the causes to a problem in the order that they contribute (most to least))

- Sum of the bars create a concave function approaching 100% 

- Bars are listed in descending order

* Purpose = highlight the most important factor among a set of factors (perhaps fix this main cause to fix the problem)

Bar chart ordered by magnitude of factor with cumulative total superimposed, meant to highlight lowest hanging fruit.

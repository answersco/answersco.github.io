title: "Fill-factor in DR/CR"
---
Fill-Factor: the area of the detector that is sensitive to x-rays in relation to the entire detector area
Higher fill factor&#8594; more efficient detection
DR systems&#8594; the electric field shaping allows for a fill factor of nearly 100%
This is not seen with indirect (CR) systems &#8594; lower fill factor and thus lower detection efficiency

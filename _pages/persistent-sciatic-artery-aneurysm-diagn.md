Aneurysmal degeneration complicates 50% of persistent sciatic arteries
-Aneurysms occur distal to the sciatic notch, probably due to repetitive trauma of the superficially located anomalous vessel.
-MRA/CTA: SFA hypoplastic or absent, while IIA is enlarged and continues into the posterior thigh through the greater sciatic foramen to the popliteal artery.
-Angio: a large, posterior branch of the IIA is seen continuing into the thigh, often with a small EIA and CFA

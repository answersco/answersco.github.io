title: "What are contraindications to PICC placement?"
---
1) Central venous occlusion or thrombosis
2) No accessible veins in upper extremities
3) Hemodialysis patients, renal transplant recipients, individuals with marginal renal function who may require future hemodialysis access as repeated PICC insertions may cause upper extremity venous thrombosis; may render veins unsuitable for creation of AV hemodialysis access. Rather consider small-bore tunneled central venous catheter instead

title: "Imaging findings of mucinous vs serous cystadenocarcinoma?"
---
Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma is 3rd most common; Multi-locular (more septations) with FEWER papillary projections
- Pseudomyxoma peritonei and SCALLOPING of solid organs
- Low-level echoes from mucin


Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma is most common
- Unilocular w/ FEWER separations (frequently bilateral, with papillary projections suggesting malignancy)
- look for ascites (peritoneal involvement)

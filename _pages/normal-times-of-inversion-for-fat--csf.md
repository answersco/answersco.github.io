title: "Normal times of inversion for fat, CSF, myocardium?"
---
- STIR: 120-160 ms TI nulls fat

- FLAIR: 2000 ms TI nulls CSF

- myocardium usually 200- 330 msec TI, but highly variable 
- in amyloid, the myocardium is difficult to suppress (may need TI as long as 350 msec, usually just ~200 ms); blood pool is DARKER than the myocardium

Thymic carcinoma: malignant, aggressive, with hematogenous metastases
Distinction between invasive thymoma and carcinoma is difficult via CT in absence of distant metastases.
Thymic carcinoid: 50% hormonally active, often secreting ACTH and causing Cushing syndrome
Associated with MEN I and II
On imaging, generally indistinguishable from thymoma and thymic carcinoma.
Preoperative indium-111 octreotride scan may assist in evaluation of suspected carcinoid.
Thymic cyst: may be secondary to XRT (e.g. Hodgkin lymphoma), associated with AIDS (especially if multilocular), or may be congenital
When congenital, thymic cyst arises from remnants of the thymopharyngeal duct, and may occur anywhere along its course of descent from the neck to anterior mediastinum.
CT: simple, fluid-attenuation cyst in anterior mediastinum.
Thymolipoma: benign, fat-containing lesion with interspersed soft-tissue.
May become quite large and drape over the mediastinum.

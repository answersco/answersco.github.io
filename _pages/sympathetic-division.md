1) increased cardiovascular activity
-HR, BP, and blood flow to skeletal muscles
2) increased respiratory efficiency
-bronchodilation: opening up airways to get more oxygen in to get more oxygen to the tissues
-increased RR
3) blood (and O2) diverted away from GI tract
-decreased bowel sounds
-slowed digestion
-sphincters are constricted
4) blood diverted away from kidneys
-activates Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) which increases volume of fluid in the body and makes you hold onto sodium and water
-result is increased BP &amp; blood volume

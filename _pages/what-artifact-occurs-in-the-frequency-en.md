title: "What artifact occurs in the frequency encoding direction?"
---
Type 1 chemical shift artifact: from macroscopic fat
-Bright rim on one side, dark on the other at SE or GRE
-Chemical shift increases with field strength
-Chemical shift decreases with increased gradient strength and wider read-out bandwidth.

On the other hand, Type 1 chemical shift artifact (black boundary, or india ink) shows a black line in all directions of the fat-water interface.
-Occurs on GRE sequences with voxels containing about 50% fat and 50% water.
-Using SE sequences will get rid of india ink, but NOT chemical shift

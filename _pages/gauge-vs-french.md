title: "Gauge vs French"
---
Gauge is used to describe needle size (smaller gauge the BIGGER the needle)
French is used to describe catheter or dilator size (large the french the BIGGER that catheter, sheath, or dilator)

Needle, catheter, and dilator - the OUTER part of the lumen is what is being measured when reporting size
Sheath - the INNER part of the lumen is being measured (this is because a catheter needs to go through this)

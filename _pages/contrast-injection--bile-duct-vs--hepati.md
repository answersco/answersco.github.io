title: "Contrast injection: bile duct vs. hepatic vein vs. portal vein"

Bile duct: contrast material flows away from the tip slowly, akin to wax flowing down a candlestick
-Hepatic vein: contrast washes quickly away toward the heart
-Portal vein: contrast washes quickly away toward the periphery of the liver.

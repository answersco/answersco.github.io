-acts by inhibiting Vitamin K clotting factors
(note do not confuse potassium (K) with Vit K, vitamin K is the antagonist)
-used for prophylaxis if pt at high risk of thrombus formation ( atrial fibrillation, prosthetic valves, joint replacement) 
-for Longer term use (months to years)
-long half life meaning it stays in the system for a longer period of time - important for dosing and incidences of bleeding, several days
-highly protein bound so have the risk of many interactions with other medications
-takes several days (3-5) to reach therapeutic effect
-must be stopped at least 2- 3 days before invasive procedures performed (heparin or maybe LMWH used until coumadin can be resumed)

INDICATIONS FOR USE: PE, DVT, MI, a-fib

ACTION: inhibits vitamin K dependent activation of clotting factors

SIDE EFFECTS: avoid foods with high vit K (cranberry juice, leafy greens, green tea), hemorrhage

THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS: decrease body's ability to form clots to reduce risk of stroke and MI -- blood thinner 

NURSING ASSESSMENT: regularly monitor INR and if too high give vit K as antagonist, check for signs of hemorrhage or major bleeding, avoid IM injections

WHAT TO MONITOR: increased INR, prolonged PT and aPTT, increase ALT and AST levels

PT TEACHING: look for signs of major bleeding, avoid OTC drugs such as aspirin and other salicylates, watch for vitamin K consumpton, certain herbal therpaies have anti-coagulant effects 

EVAULATION: prolonged PT, INR of 2-4.5, H&amp;H

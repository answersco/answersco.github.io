This civilization, located in what is Central America today, flourished as an independent site for the emergence of agriculture. By 1500 B.C.E., the Olmecs had settled along river banks near the Gulf of Mexico, and there built the city of San Lorenzo and later the city of La Venta. The Olmecs developed complex religous, political, and social structures that fostered a rich artistic and cultural life. Massive sculptures of colossal heads display the Olmecs' artistic talents.

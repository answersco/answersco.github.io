title: "Doppler findings in subclavian steal"
---
Stenosis/occlusion of proximal subclavian artery with retrograde flow in the ipsilateral vertebral artery.

Will show as retrograde flow in left vertebral or stenosis of subclavian with high velocity.

Could also show early steal: starts with mid-systolic deceleration with antegrade late-systolic velocities, then proceeds to to-and-fro flow with below-baseline late systolic velocity.

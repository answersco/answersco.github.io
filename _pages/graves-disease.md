Most common cause of hyperthyroidism (primary)
From antibody directed at TSH-receptor&#8594; actual TSH level is low

Gland is enlarged, and &quot;inferno hot&quot; on Doppler
Graves ophthalmopathy: spares the myotendinous insertions, and painless (unlike pseudotumor). Also has increased intraorbital fat.
NM: increased uptake of I-123 with %RAIU usually 50-80%, and accentuation of the pyramidal lobe.

big thyroid and very vascular

Most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Autoimmune disorder, thyroid-stimulating antibodies cause hyperplasia and hyperfunction of thyroid gland.

Autoimmune disorder characterized by hyperthyroidism, thyromegaly, homogenously increased thyroid activity, and often a prominent pyramidal lobe

Caused by antibody to the thyrotropin receptor
TSH very low, T3 and T4 will be high
Scintigraphy shows homogeneously increased glandular uptake, with increased uptake at 4 and 24 hours. Sometimes 24 hour uptake is lower than the 4 hours (or even normal) from rapid hormone production.

45% show the pyramidal lobe (seen in 10% of normal studies).
Graves shows uptake in 70s, while toxic MNG is in 40s usually (with heterogeneous uptake).

Hyperemic thyroid that is enlarged
TSH receptor stimulated by antibiody binding the receptor. TSH levels are super LOW
On i-123 you are going to have INCREASED uptake usually 50-80%

Orbital opthalmopathy:
- Spares the tendon sheeths (UNLIKE pseudotumor) and it doesn't hurt (UNLIKE pseudotumor)
- You will see increased intra-orbital fat
- Remember the I'M SLOW mnemonic for how the muscles are involved (this is basically just counter clockwise starting at the inferior rectus)

NM: increased uptake of I-123 with HIGH %RAIU usually 50-80%, and accentuation of the pyramidal lobe.

Hyperthyroid - we don't image hypothyroid

-toxic goiter
-autoantibodies mimic effect of TSH on the thyroid (bind and activate TSH recetor), causing thyroid hypersecretion

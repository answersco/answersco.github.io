title: "Where is the ideal spot to access the femoral artery and why?"

Inferiomedial margin of the femoral head- First a hard surface to press against to provide adequate hemostasis. Second here the artery and nerve are side by side, if you go to low you may puncture femoral vein and cause and AVF. Here, the vein runs deep to the artery.

title: "What kind of sequence is a DWI?"
---
Spin Echo (usually echo planar imaging technique) - with 2 opposite gradients applied on EITHER side of the 180 refocusing pulse

B0 = essentially just a poorman's T2 (the contribution of diffusion is set to zero)

To get your actual ADC, the B0 and B1000 are compared via a negative logarithm

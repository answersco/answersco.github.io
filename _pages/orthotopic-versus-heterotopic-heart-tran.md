title: "Orthotopic versus heterotopic heart transplant"
---
Orthotopic: all of the recipient heart is removed, except the circular part of the LA (the part with the pulmonary veins).
The donor heart is trimmed to fit into the LA

Heterotopic: recipient heart remains in place, and the donor heart is added on top- basically creates a double heart.
Advantages: gives the native heart a chance to recover.
Gives you a backup if the donor is rejected.

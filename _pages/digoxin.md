title: "Digoxin"
---
CLASSIFICATION: inotropes

INDICATIONS FOR USE: heart failure, a-fib

ACTION: slows conduction of heart by inhibiting Na+/K+ channels and promoting movement of calcium to strengthen myocardial contraction

SIDE EFFECTS: yellow/green halos around visual images, photophobia

THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS: increased cardiac output, slows heart rate, narrow therapeutic range

NURSING ASSESSMENT: watch dig levels in blood for signs of toxicity, hold if &lt; 60 bpm

WHAT TO MONITOR: heart rhythms and waves and electrolyte imbalances

PT TEACHING: contact HCP if &lt; 60 bpm, combining with atenolol may increase risk of bradycardia

EVALUATION: decreased severity of HF, decreased ventricular response in a-fib, increased cardiac output

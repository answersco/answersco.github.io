title: "Nurse's role in sympathomimetics drug therapy"
---
You have a pt who you are thinking about giving a sympathomimetic to and they have hypotension:

-assessment: vital signs, history of diseases or comorbidities like hyperthyroid or CAD, any other medications, allergies
-nursing diagnoses
-implementation: blood volume checked by amount of urine output to see if they are voiding, color of urine output could indicate dehydration
-evaluation: check if it is working, check for side effects (is it working too well),

title: "Pathogenesis of tuberculosis"
---
-bacteria resistant to drying - persist in environment - larger risk of spreading than other bacteria
-transmission: aerosol
-bacteria enters lung
-taken up by resident macrophages - not destroyed
-persons immune system reacts to bacteria
-tubercle formation (mass of cells that build up around lung and can grow large) lung damage and creating less and less air space

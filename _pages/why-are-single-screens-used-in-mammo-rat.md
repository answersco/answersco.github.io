title: "Why are single screens used in mammo rather than dual screens?"
---
although dual screens are more efficient at x-ray detection, more scatter is produced with 2 screens than with a single screen, and image sharpness is diminished. Since we want foci (ie: a single punctate calcification) to be as sharp as possible, we use only 1 screen.

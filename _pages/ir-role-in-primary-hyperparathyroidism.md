Primary hyper-PTH: independent secretion of PTH by an adenoma

Normal supply of parathyroid glands
-Inferior and superior thyroidal arteries
-Rarely small branch directly from aortic arch (thyroid ima)

Persistent hyperPTH after surgical treatment is an indication for angio and venous sampling
-Angio search for ectopic parathyroid gland requires selective injection of thyrocervical trunk, internal mammary arteries, and external carotid or superior thyroidal arteries
-Arch injection in LAO projection needed to identify a thyroid IMA artery
-Parathyroid adenomas appear as densely staining masses at angio.
-Uncommonly perform wedged injection of hypertonic contrast or absolute alcohol into adenoma.

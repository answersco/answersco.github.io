Dermoid cyst: congenital lesion, usually presents in childhood.
Contains macroscopic fat&#8594; hyperintense on T1-weighted images.
Rare dermoid rupture can cause chemical meningitis.

Epidermoid cyst&#8594; rare acquired spinal tumor.
Usually intradural-extramedullary, but may rarely be intramedullary.
Typically appears similar to simple cyst (hypointense on T1, hyperintense on T2).
May have faint peripheral enhancement.
Occasionally cyst contents may be proteinaceous, causing T1 shortening.
As with other epidermoids, diffusivity is restricted (unlike arachnoid cyst).

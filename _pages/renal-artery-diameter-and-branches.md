title: "Renal artery diameter and branches"
---
Renal arteries are usually 5-6 mm in diameter
-Each renal artery gives rise to a small proximal branch to the adrenal gland (inferior adrenal arteries) and the renal capsule
-In region of renal pelvis, the artery bifurcates into anterior and posterior divisions.
-The divisional arteries divide into segmental arteries (apical, upper, middle, lower, and posterior) arteries, which quickly give rise to the lobar and then interlobar arteries.
-At corticomedullary junction, the interlobar arteries divide into the arcute arteries.
-Terminal branches of the renal artery are the interlobular arteries.

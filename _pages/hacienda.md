A large Spanish-owned estate in the Americas, often run as a farm or a cattle ranch

Spanish estates in the Americas that were often plantations. They often represent the gradual removal of land from peasant ownership and a type of feudalistic order where the owners of Haciendas would have agreements of loyalty to the capital but would retain control over the actual land. This continued even into the 20th century.

Spanish colonists formed large, self-sufficient farming estates known as these.

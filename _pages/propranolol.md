title: "Propranolol"
---
-nonselective beta blocker so it will block Beta1 and Beta2
-decreased HR, decreased contractility, decreased oxygen consumption, bronchoconstriction (so be careful giving these to anyone with respiratory issues)
-can be giving for HTN; will inhibit renin release bc they block Beta1

beta blocker by blocking the effects of catecholamines which lowers Ca2+ resulting in reduced contractility

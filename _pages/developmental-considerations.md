-in children younger than 2 years, the skin is thinner and weaker than it is in adults.
-an infant's skin and mucous membranes are easily injured and subject to infection; a child's skin becomes increasingly resistant to injury and infection.
-the structure of the skin changes as a person ages; the maturation of epidermal cells is prolonged, leading to thin, easily damaged skin.
-circulation and collagen formation are impaired, leading to decreased elasticity and increased risk for tissue damage from pressure.

title: "What spatial encoding direction takes longest?"
---
Phase encoding: encodes spatial information in the vertical direction. 
Much longer than frequency encoding: done on the thinner portion (side to side in head, front to back in abdomen), with the exception of in the breast.
# of phase encoding steps contributes to the duration of a 2D imaging sequence

Duration = TR x Npy x Nex
TR = repetition time
Npy = # of phase-encoding steps
Nex = # of excitations.

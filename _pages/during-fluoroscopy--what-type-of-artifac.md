SATURATION ARTIFACT


When the automatic brightness control senses a very dense object, it's attempts to compensate for the lack of photons (which are being attenuated by the metallic device) by turning up the dose and this leads to structures adjacent to the metallic device to appear brighter. This is known as saturation artifact. 



Pincushion is bending of the image at the periphery, while S distortion is due to external magnetic fields.

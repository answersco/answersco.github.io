title: "What does particle disease in hip arthroplasty look like?"
---
Endosteal scalloping that's SMOOTH without secondary bone response. 
- lucency does NOT conform to the adjacent prosthesis (it does in Loosening)

- Seen in non-cemented hips around the screws

- Get a CT to evaluate complete extent (if asymptomatic and hip stable, no need to remove the prosthesis!)

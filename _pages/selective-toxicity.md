title: "Selective toxicity"
---
-ability of a drug to only attack those systems in foreign cells

Examples:
-antibiotics: good selective toxicity, we know what we're treating and the antibiotic will treat only the infection needed to be treated, damaging only bad cells
-chemotherapeutic agents: poor selective toxicity, medication is not able to discern people healthy or non-healthy cells

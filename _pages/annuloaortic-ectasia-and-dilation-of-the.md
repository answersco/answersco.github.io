title: "Annuloaortic ectasia and dilation of the aortic root (&quot;tulip bulb&quot;) is seen in which disease?"
---
Marfan's (leads to aortic insufficiency)
* In Mafan's, the most common location for aneurysmal dilatation is the AORTIC ROOT
* Repair at 5 cm for risk of rupture

Tulip bulb because there's dilation of the annulus extending to the proximal ascending aorta with obliteration of the sinotubular junction!

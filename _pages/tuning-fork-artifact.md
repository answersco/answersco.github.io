title: "Tuning fork artifact"
---
Seen in cardiac SPECT, which uses a 180 degree orbit
When a point source is imaged, it should look like a point source
If there is an error with the COR (misregistration error), it will look like a tuning fork (2 lines in 1 direction, 1 line in the other)- same appearance can be seen with motion

This is seen with SPECT 
When a point source is imaged to calibrate cardiac CT you will see TWO lines in one direction and ONE line in the opposite direciton

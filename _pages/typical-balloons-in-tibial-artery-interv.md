title: "Typical balloons in tibial artery intervention"
---
Typical balloon diameters for the tibial arteries are 2-4 mm.
-These small-vessel balloons often require 0.018 inch or smaller guidewires.
-Lesions at origins of the tibial arteries can undergo PTA safely using kissing balloons in both arteries or a safety wire in one and the balloon in the other.
-Long balloons (&gt;/= 20 cm) are specifically designed for PTA of diffusely diseased tibial arteries. These can also be used for PTA through the pedal arch.

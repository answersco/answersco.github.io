title: "Attenuation artifact PET"
---
Basically this is due to different sizes between the CT gantry and the PET gantry
Fat will be hanging out of the CT (cant fit) therefore that skin will not get incorporated into attenuation correction
THUS once the PET is done (whole body fits into the PET), it will take counts away from these areas

title: "What is a Pareto Chart? - what is the purpose?"
---
it is essentially a prioritization of exercise
- take causes to a problem and rank them in the order they contribute to the problem

Purpose: highlight the most important factor among a set of factors
- fixing the main cause, may fix the problem

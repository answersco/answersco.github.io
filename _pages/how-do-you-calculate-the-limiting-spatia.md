title: "How do you calculate the limiting spatial resolution for an imaging system that contains 100 samples per horizontal row that is 100 mm long?"
---
To find the limiting spatial resolution, one first must calculate the sampling frequency, which equals the number of samples (100) divided by the row length (100), equaling 1 sample/mm in this example. The limiting spatial resolution is &#189; the sampling frequency, or 0.5 line pair per mm.

title: "Tc-99m sestamibi in cardiac imaging"

Unlike thallium&#8594; Tc-99m does not undergo redistribution &#8594; remains fixed in myocardium
Enters myocardium via passive diffusion&#8594; binds to mitochondrial membrane proteins
Myocardial uptake of sestamibi &#8594; is proportional to myocardial perfusion (like thallium)

Hemangioma:
Capillary hemangioma&#8594; rare, and only seen in the 1st year of life
Cavernous hemangioma&#8594; presents with progressive proptosis
CT&#8594; ovoid, enhancing intraconal or extraconal mass, +/- bony remodeling.
MRI&#8594; well-defined mass that is isointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images, with early, patchy enhancement that fills in.

Lymphangioma (low-flow lymphatic malformation) &#8594; typically extraconal
Imaging: multilocular cystic mass, often with complex internal contents and fluid levels from prior hemorrhage. 
Slight peripheral and septal enhancement is common.

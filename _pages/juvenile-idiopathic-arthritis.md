Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA): present for &gt; 6 weeks in patient &lt; 16; usually RF neg.
Most commonly pauciarticular, usually affecting the knee.
Earliest changes are joint effusion, soft tissue swelling, and osteopenia, with periostitis and erosions following.
Chronic disease leads to joint ankylosis (unlike RA), most commonly the wrist, CMC joints, and cervical spine.
Cervical spine ankylosis can appear similar to Klippel-Feil syndrome, but is without segmentation abnormalities.
Synovitis and hyperemia lead to accelerated skeletal maturation and bone growth &#8594; premature fusion of physes and/or abnormal bone growth.
Still disease&#8594; acute systemic subtype in patients &lt; 5, with fever, anemia, leukocytosis, hepatosplenomegaly, and polyarthritis.

By definition this has to occur before the age of 16
Look for epiphyseal overgrowth

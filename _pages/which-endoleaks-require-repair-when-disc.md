title: "Which endoleaks require repair when discovered?"
---
Types I (lack of seal between endograft and artery) and III (hole in graft material or separation of modular elements) should be treated when discovered because they have strong correlation with AAA enlargement.
-I leaks can be treated with endograft extensions, III leaks with endograft &quot;patches.&quot;

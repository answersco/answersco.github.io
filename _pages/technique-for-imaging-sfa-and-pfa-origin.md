title: "Technique for imaging SFA and PFA origins"
---
The SFA and PFA origins are usually best viewed from an ipsilateral anterior oblique projection.
-These views should be obtained when the vessel origins are not clearly seen with AP.
-Additional oblique and even lateral views of specific abnormalities are not usually obtained, but can be important to accurately grade stenoses, particularly in tibial arteries where overlying bone can obscure vessels.

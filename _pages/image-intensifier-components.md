Image Intensifier: converts x-rays to electrons, accelerates them, and then converts them to a visible image.
Along the course of conversion from x-rays to light and then back to electrons, the electron flux and energy are amplified by the II &#8594; results in a greater amount of light emerging from output phosphor.

Input phosphor = CsI &#8594; captures x-rays and converts them to light

Photocathode: converts light to electrons

Output phosphor: converts electrons to light. 
Smaller than input phosphor.

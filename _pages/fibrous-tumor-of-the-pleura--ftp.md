Fibrous tumor of pleura (FTP): focal pleural mass not related to asbestosis or mesothelioma. 20-30% malignant, so all are excised
May be associated with hypoglycemia or pulmonary osteoarthropathy uncommonly.
May be pedunculated. Pleural-based mass that changes positions is suggestive of FTP.
Typically low FDG-uptake on PET.

Determined with thin layer chromatography
*Free Tech migrates in saline AND methanol
*TcCompounds migrate in saline only

Free TC or reduced hydrolyzed Tc use thin layer chromatography

Remember Tc comes out attached to sodium
Thin layer cromotography is used for this

Testing for free Tc. Use thin layer chromatography.

How much free Tc? Tested with thin layer chromatography

title: "Myocardial contraction"
---
-calcium breaks troponin block to allow contraction to happen
-calcium comes from outside the cell
-once is comes inside the cell, it stimulates the sarcoplasmic reticulum to secrete more calcium
-troponin is what keeps the barrier between actin and myosin fibers so when it is pulled away it allows the two fibers to connect and pull and contract

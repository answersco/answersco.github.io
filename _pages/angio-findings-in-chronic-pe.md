title: "Angio findings in chronic PE"
---
Angio allows direct determination of right heart and PA pressures
Commonly see subtle intimal irregularities, stenoses, webs, occlusions, and a &quot;pruned&quot; or branchless appearance of the pulmonary artery.
Remnants of recanalized emboli can be seen as linear filling defects = synechia
Limitation: inability to characterize the extent of mural thrombus in a PA.

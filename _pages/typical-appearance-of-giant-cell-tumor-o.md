title: "Typical appearance of giant-cell tumor of the tendon sheath (GCTTS) and how to distinguish from synovial sarcoma"
---
GCTTS: located anterior to the tendon sheath in the extremities.
In the finger, the flexor tendons are separate from the mass.
Foci of low T1/T2 signal in the lesion, solid enhancement, and location adjacent or attached to the tendon sheath are typical.

Synovial sarcoma and foreign body granuloma are usually very bright on T2.

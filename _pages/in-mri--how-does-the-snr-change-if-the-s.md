title: "In MRI, how does the SNR change if the sensitive volume of the RF coil is &#8593;?"
---
Answer: The SNR &#8595;
As the sensitivity of the RF coil increases, the volume within the coil contributing to image noise also increases, thus degrading the SNR
Conversely, SNR will improve if local coils and surface coils are used

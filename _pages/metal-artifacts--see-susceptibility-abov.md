title: "Metal Artifacts (see susceptibility above)"
---
-Gradient Echo sequences are more susceptible to Metal Artifact due to the lack of a 180 degree refocusing pulse
Reduce Metallic Artifacts by.. (ABOVE) 
-Use of TSE(ETL) over Gradient Echo
-Use STIR instead of Fat suppression techniques
-Use Wide Receiver Bandwidth (more noise bc quicker sampling)
-No parallel imaging correction
-Thin Slices
-Small Pixel size/Large matrix
-High TSE(ETL) Factor
-Add NSE/NEX to buy back signal

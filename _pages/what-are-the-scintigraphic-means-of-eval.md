title: "What are the scintigraphic means of evaluating upper GI bleeding?"
---
Tc-99m Sulfur Colloid can be used; very sensitive for small quantities, but upper GI sources can be obscured by spleen and liver uptake. Pt must be bleeding at time of injection. 

Tagged RBC scan, also very sensitive and very specific for any GI bleeding.

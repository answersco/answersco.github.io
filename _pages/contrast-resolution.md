Decrease kvp- using aec/phototimer

Increasing mas : dose 1:1 

Decrease scatter: collimate. Grid. Dec air gap and tissue thickeness

1)Number of Photon, N- linear increase in relationship
- quantum mottle/noise also increases (a) but at a lesser rate (square root of 2 if N doubles)
2) Thinner slices (kvp, mas, pitch constant) - less SNR but less vol averaging
3) better with smaller pt
4) improves with larger pixel
5) lower spatial frequency (soft tissue) reconstruction algorithm

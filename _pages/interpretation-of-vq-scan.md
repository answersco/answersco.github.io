In a PE, you assume that ventilation will not be affected and perfusion will be absent in the section of lung affected - ventilation/perfusion MISMATCH

Perfusion defect classification
- Segmental vs. nonsegmental - 
- Size - large, moderate, or small; 2 moderate defects can be added to create a large defect; small defects cannot be added
- Mismatch vs. matched - normal CXR is assumed

PIOPED Criteria
High probability - greater than 80% chance
- must have a minimum of 2 large segmental mismatched defects (or equivalent in moderate defects)
Intermediate - 20-80% chance
Low- less than 20% chance
Very low- less than 10% chance
Normal

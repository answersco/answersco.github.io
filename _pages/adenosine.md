-used in specific situations (used to diagnose and/or convert SVT [supraventricular tachycardia]
-has a very-short half-life - entire duration is 15 seconds
-slows conduction through the AV node
-prolongs the refractory period
-decreases automaticity of AV node
-helps to see dysrhythmias happening in slow motion so they know what exactly the dysrhythmia looks like
-put by IV site with 3 way stop to get it to the heart as quick as possible bc it is such a fast-acting medication - so give adenosine then the flush so it gets to the heart as quickly as possible
-stops the pt's heart and all electrical conduction of the heart so warn them of that

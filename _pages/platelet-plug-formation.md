title: "Platelet plug formation"
---
-second stage in hemostasis
-involves the disruption of prostacyclin
-involves endothelial collagen exposure
-involves degranulation and serotonin, thromboxane A2 and ADP

1) broken vessel exposes collagen
2) platelet pseudopods stick to damaged vessel and other platelets
3) pseudopods contract - draw together a platelet plug tightly
4) platelets degranulate releasing a variety of substances
-serotonin is a vasoconstrictor
-ADP attracts and degranulates more platelets
-thromboxane A2, an eicosanoid, promotes platelet aggregation, degranulation, and vasoconstriction
-positive feedback cycle is active until break in small vessel is sealed

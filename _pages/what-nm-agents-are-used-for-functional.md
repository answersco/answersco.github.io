title: "What NM agents are used for functional (dynamic) imaging?"
---
Normal kidney function is 80% secretion and 20% filtration. Tracer choice based on what parameters you want to evaluation.

Tc-DTPA: almost all filtration - great for GFR
-5% of DTPA protein bound (not filtered)- slightly underestimates GFR
-Critical organ = bladder
-Good for native kidneys with normal renal function

Tc-MAG3: almost exclusively secreted- estimates effective renal plasma flow (ERPF)
-Cleared by proximal tubules
-Concentrated by kidneys with POOR renal function
-Critical organ = bladder

Tc-glucoheptonate (GH): structural imaging or functional imaging
-Filtered
-Good for dynamic and cortical imaging
-Critical organ = bladder

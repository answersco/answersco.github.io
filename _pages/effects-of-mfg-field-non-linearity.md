title: "Effects of MFG field non-linearity:"
---
MFG distortions&#8594; can create bizarre-looking features at the edges of large FOV, and poor performance of protocols that require off-center FOV (e.g. imaging of the shoulder).
Gradient non-linearity can also affect the planarity of structures.
In the presence of non-linear gradients&#8594; the surface of an imaged slice is no longer planar, but forms a concave or saddle-shaped form.
&#8594; structures visible on the image are no longer co-planar (things close to the isocenter are at a different location along the slice select direction than things at the periphery of the FOV)

title: "ABI limitations"
---
ABI can be falsely elevated in patients with DM with noncompressible vessels due to calcific medial sclerosis
-Toe pressures are an important indicator of severity, as these are less severely affected.
-Normal SBP in toe is &gt; 50, with toe-brachial index of &gt; 0.6

ABI does not provide any information about the level of obstruction
-Can obtain BPs at 3-4 different levels (segmental limb pressures)
-Drop in pressure of &gt; 20-30 mmHg at any level suggests hemodynamically significant occlusive disease in that vascular segment
-Difference in pressures from side to side &gt; 20 indicates occlusive disease at that level or proximal in the affected limb.

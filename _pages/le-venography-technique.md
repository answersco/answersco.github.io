Venography: time-consuming, and requires 100-150 mL of contrast per limb

Table tilted with head up 30-60 degrees with all weight-bearing on opposite leg. 
Tourniquet placed around ankle to force contrast into deep system.
Hand injection used to control amount of contrast in veins during study: initial injection of 5-10 mL
Filling of venous system monitored with intermittent fluoro during continuous hand injection.
Calf veins opacified in most patients with 50-80 mL of contrast.
Images obtained in 3 projections (AP and both obliques) using large FOV coned side-to-side.
DSV not usually performed as contrast clears too slowly from veins, resulting in poor image quality.

Contrast followed as it ascends the leg
-Iliac veins filled by compressing the FV, repositioning the table so that the patient is either flat or in mild Trendelenburg, then releasing the FV compression.
-The contrast-filled leg then empties into the iliac veins and proximal IVC.

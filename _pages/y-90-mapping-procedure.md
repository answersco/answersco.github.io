title: "Y-90 mapping procedure"
---
Angiography performed to assess hepatic arterial anatomy
Test dose of Tc-99 MAA delivered into hepatic artery at likely site of Y-90 embolization. Tc-99-MAA is theoretically the same size as Y-90 spheres and simulates their distribution.

Requires selective injection of SMA, celiac, L gastric, R hepatic, and L hepatic arteries.
-Cystic, R gastric, gastroduodenal, and any anomalous branches to stomach, intestine, or diaphragm should be identified, and potentially embolized.
-More aggressive embolization recommended when using the resin spheres because of high number of particles infused and higher risk of reflux.

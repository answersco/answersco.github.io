title: "What are the classic VQ ventilation tracers?"
---
1. Xenon-133 (bio half life just 30 seconds; 80 keV energy) = DO THIS PART FIRST (to avoid down scatter)
- can only do 1 view because short half life
- WILL show air trapping in COPD
&quot;Trap Zenon the Zequel&quot;

2. Tc99m DTPA = breathe through mouth guard with nose clamp. Also DO THIS PART FIRST
Adv: slower washout so CAN DO MULTIPLE PROJECTIONS
- Lower radiation dose; no need for collection device

Disadv:
- Cannot demonstrating air trapping like Xenon
- Central deposition in COPD &amp; tachypneic patients

title: "Carotid-cavernous fistula"

Carotid is attached to the cavernous sinus
Look for ENLARGED opthalmic draining veins
Look for proptosis
PULSATILE exopathalmos

This can be seen postraumatic
What you are going to see is early filling of the cavernous sinus in the arterial phase
Additionally, because the opthalmic vein connects to the cavernous sinus, this is going to be markedly enlarged (see image)

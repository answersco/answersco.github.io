Transmesenteric: through defects in any of the 3 true mesenteries (SB mesentery, transverse mesocolon, and sigmoid mesentery)
Most common is transmesocolic due to defect in transverse mesocolon, most commonly after RNYGB or liver transplantation.
Variable imaging appearance
May see posterior displacement of the colon, with SB located anterior to colon. 
SMA/SMV may be displaced and engorged.
Whirl sign suggests volvulus
Most common cause in children due to congenital mesenteric defect

Paraduodenal hernia: congenital anomalies, with defect more commonly on the left, and association with malrotation
More common left paraduodenal hernia: bowel can herniate through defect named Landzert's fossa, located behind the ascending (4th) duodenum &#8594; key finding of cluster of SB loops between the pancreas and stomach.

Foramen of Winslow hernia: foramen of Winslow is communication between the lesser sac and the greater peritoneal cavity
Key features include dilated bowel loops in upper abdomen and presence of mesentery between the IVC and main portal vein

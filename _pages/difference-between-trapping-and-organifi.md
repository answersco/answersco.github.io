title: "Difference between trapping and organification in the thyroid?"
---
Trapping = analog is transported into gland (I-123, I-131, and Tc99m)

Organification = oxidized by TPO and bound to tyrosyl (I-131, and I-123; not Tc99m which slowly washes out)

Use Tc99m when they've had recent thyroid blocker on board, including Iodinated contrast

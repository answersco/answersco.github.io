The location of the 0.5 mT (5Gs) boundary &#8594; inside which the static magnetic field exceeds 0.5 mT (about 10X Earth's magnetic field).
The 0.5 mT (5 Gs) limit&#8594; adopted by FDA as a safety boundary defining the restricted access space of the MRI scanner
Divides &quot;unrestricted public space&quot; from the &quot;restricted access space&quot; of the MRI suite.

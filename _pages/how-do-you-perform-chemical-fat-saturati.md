title: "How do you perform chemical fat saturation? (e..g not STIR)"
---
This capitalizes on difference in fat and water protons' RESONANCE (fat slower than water)

1. Prep pulse - very narrow RF pulse at the resonance of fat (fat gets flipped)
2. Spoiler gradient to dephase these specific protons
3. The remaining protons (NOT FAT) are the only ones available to give a signal, so then you send in the RF pulse immediately after the spoiler.

* Requires excellent field homogeneity

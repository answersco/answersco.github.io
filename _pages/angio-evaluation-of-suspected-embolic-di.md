title: "Angio evaluation of suspected embolic disease"
---
Aortogram may reveal silent emboli to renal or visceral branches, or patholology such as an aneurysm or large ulcerated plaque
-As a minimum, imaging should span from Ao bifurcation to below the level of the occlusion
-Oblique views of pelvis may show emboli in hypogastric arteries, confirming the nature of the more distal occlusion
-Should try to image reconstituted vessels distal to occlusion if feasible (may be difficult or impossible in patients with poor collaterals)

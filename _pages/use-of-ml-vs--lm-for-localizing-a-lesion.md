title: "Use of ML vs. LM for localizing a lesion"
---
True lateral: useful for localizing things seen on a single view only (the CC))
Trick: use whatever you said on the screener as the last letter for the call back
If it's lateral on the screener, you want the ML on the diagnostic (if medial on screener, you want LM). This is because it moves the lesion closer to the receptor.

If you seen the area of interest on the MLO only (not the CC), you should pick ML, because 70% of breast cancers occur laterally.

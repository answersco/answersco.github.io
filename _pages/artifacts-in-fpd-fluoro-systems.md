Bad pixel: appear as white or black spots
One method to correct this (often built into system) is to interpolate in order to fill in the data

Lag artifact (ghosting): tends to occur if the exposure uses very high radiation

FPD systems don't have pincushion or S-distortion, vignette, glare, or saturation artifacts.

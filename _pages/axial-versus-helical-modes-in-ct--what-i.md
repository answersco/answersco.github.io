title: "Axial versus helical modes in CT  What is stationary in axial scanning?  Where is there better spatial resolution w/ axial scanning?"
---
Axial: step and shoot
-table stationary during acquisition
Better spatial resolution in the z-direction since full image-sets are taken.
No partial volume effect along the long axis

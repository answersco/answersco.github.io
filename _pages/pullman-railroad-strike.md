title: "Pullman railroad strike:"
---
A nationwide conflict between labor unions, led by Eugene V. Debs, and railroads that occurred in 1894. The conflict began in the town of Pullman, Illinois on May 11 when employees of the Pullman Palace Car Company began a wildcat strike in response to recent reductions in wages, bringing traffic west of Chicago to a halt. President Grover Cleveland ordered federal troops to Chicago to end the strike. The conflict peaked on July 6, shortly after the troops' arrival in the city, and ended several days later.

Inversion Recovery (IR) pulses &#8594; used to null the signal from a desired tissue to accentuate surrounding pathology. 
Commonly used to null signal from normal myocardium during delayed enhancement imaging &#8594; nulled normal myocardium will be dark in contrast to enhanced abnormal myocardium.

Nulling normal myocardium requires finding the appropriate inversion time (TI) at which normal myocardium is dark&#8594; usually ~330 msec after RF pulse, but variable

TI scout series&#8594; each image has progressively longer TI &#8594; choose darkest
Phase-Sensitive Inversion Recovery (PSIR) &#8594; newer automated sequence that doesn't require TI scout.
IR can also be used in fat-suppressed images to null signal from fat for better characterization of adjacent structures.

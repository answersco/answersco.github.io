---
Lesion type A: 
Unilateral or bilateral stenosis of CIA
Unilateral or bilateral single stenosis (&lt;/= 3 cm) of EIA

Lesion type B: 
Short (&lt;/= 3 cm) stenosis of infrarenal aorta
Unilateral CIA occlusion
Single or multiple stenoses totaling 3-10 cm involving the EIA, not extending into CFA
Unilateral EIA occlusion not involving origins of IIA or CFA

Lesion type C: surgery preferred
Bilateral CIA occlusion
Bilateral EIA stenosis 3-10 cm long not extending into CFA
Unilateral EIA stenosis extending into CFA
unilateral EIA occlusion that involves the origins of the IIA and/or CFA.
Heavily-calcified unilateral EIA occlusion with or without involvement of origins of IIA and/or CFA

Lesion type D: surgery is tx of choice
Infrarenal aortoiliac occlusion
Diffuse disease involving aorta and both iliac arteries requiring treatment
Diffuse multiple stenoses involging CIA, EIA, and CFA
Unilateral occlusion of both CIA or EIA
Biliateral EIA occlusions
Iliac stenosis in patients with AAA requiring treatment and not amenable to endograft placement or other lesions requiring open aortic or iliac surgery.

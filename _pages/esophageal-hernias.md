title: "Esophageal hernias"

Always think about these as the relationship between the GE junciton and the diaphragm
Axial (sliding) hernia: GE junction ABOVE the diaphragm
Paraesophageal (rolling) GE junction is BELOW the diaphragm, BUT a piece of the stomach has herniated above the diaphragm . USUALLY to the LEFT of the esophagus. These have a higher rate of incarceration (image)

**I think the image is really good because it shows the B ring right about where it should be so this is clearly all stomach)

Congenital absence of the pericardium: spectrum of disorders ranging from a focal pericardial defect to complete absence of the right and left pericardium.
Most common form involves the left pericardium in the region of the LAA and adjacent pulmonary artery.
Patients with partial absence of pericardium&#8594; at risk for herniation of a portion of the heart through the pericardial defect.
Imaging: clue to presence of a pericardial defect is a lucent notch between the aorta and pulmonary artery (better seen on CT than XR), which represents interposed lung between these vascular structures.
Defects of the left pericardium cause leftward displacement of the heart, which may sometimes be the only imaging finding.

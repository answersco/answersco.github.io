title: "If a patient undergoes radioactive therapy and must be hospitalized, what is true of the patient's caregiver?"
---
The caregiver may potentially be allowed to exceed the 1 mSv/year (dose limit for the public) limit

Caregiver requires close contact. To address this situation, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) allows dose limits for caregivers to be established on a case-by-case basis by the licensee, and that their doses be limited only by the demands of their caregiving functions and the needs of the patient, provided the dose not be permitted to be high enough to present an immediate danger to the health of the caregiver or to increase the potential long-term risks resulting from radiation exposure to unacceptable levels.

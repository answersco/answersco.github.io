title: "What is delayed myocardial hyperenhancement (DHE), how is it imaged, and what does it mean?"
---
Delayed myocardial enhancement is retention of contrast in the myocardium on delayed images performed 10-15 minutes after the IV contrast. A T1 weighted inversion recovery sequence is used in which normal myocardium is nulled to accentuate the delayed enhancement. It indicates abnormal myocardium and may be acute or chronic.

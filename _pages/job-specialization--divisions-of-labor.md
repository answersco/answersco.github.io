title: "Job specialization (divisions of labor)"
---
This practice means that workers in a community perform different tasks. Job specialization divides the work of a community into specific jobs and assigns these jobs to different individuals. Specialization leads to greater proficiency as well as increases in efficiency and productivity. Job specialization took place as a result of the food surplus and populations increase brought about by the Neolithic Revolution.

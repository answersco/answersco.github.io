1) auscultate lungs: if there is not good air exchange, you may hear shallow or even absent lung sounds in certain lung fields
-atelectasis: alveoli of the lungs, where the air exchange happens, collapse on themselves due to lack of deep breathing meaning less opportunity for capillary exchange to happen (more surface area on a grape than a raisin)

title: "Magnetic susceptibility artifact and approaches to reduce it:"
---
Causes&#8594; 
Dramatic changes in magnetic susceptibility.
Presence of metal objects in patient or scanner (these artifacts will tend to be very obvious).

Common in&#8594; 
T2*-weighted sequences.
Gradient-echo sequences.
Echo-planar (EPI) sequences.

Remedy&#8594; 
Remove metal if possible
Try to use non-gradient echo sequences (best).
&#8593; bandwidth (fair) &#8593; matrix (fair) &#8595; slice thickness (fair)
For EPI and minimal susceptibility artifact, try using parallel imaging, or &#8593; the parallel imaging acceleration rate.

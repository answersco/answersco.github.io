title: "Gastric GIST:"
---
GIST: most common submucosal gastric tumor (can occur anywhere in GI tract)
May be benign or malignant, with risk determined by size and # of mitoses
Regardless of size/mitoses, gastric GIST is less likely to be malignant than similar-sized GIST in small bowel or rectum
Gastric tumors &lt; 2 cm are almost always benign
Imaging: smooth endoluminal surface due to submucosal location
Larger tumors have tendency to become exophytic, or less commonly to invade the lumen

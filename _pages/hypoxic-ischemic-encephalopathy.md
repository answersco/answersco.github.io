title: "Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy"
---
Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy injury patterns are highly variable depending on brain maturity, severity, and the length of insult. Mild to moderate hypoxic insult may cause watershed zone infarcts. Severe insult affects gray matter structures such as the basal ganglia, thalami, cortex, cerebellum, hippocampi. MR is best to assess the overall extent of injury. Diffusion images are 1st to be positive within hours of the insult. Signal changes on T2 may be very subtle in the 1st 24 hours. If MR is negative in the 1st 24 hours, a repeat exam at 2-4 days is suggested to exclude delayed injury. Severe hypoxic insult may result in death or profound long-term neurologic disability.

-Circulatory or respiratory failure
-MRI: Increased T2 signal in grey matter, restricted diffusion, FLAIR signal

CT: 
-loss of grey-white matter differentiation
-&quot;white cerebellum sign&quot;

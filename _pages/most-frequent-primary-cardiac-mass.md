title: "Most frequent primary cardiac mass"

Cardiac Myxoma: most common primary cardiac tumor
Typically middle-aged patients, in women &gt; men
May have peripheral embolization of the tumor, obstruction of an AV valve, or symptoms of systemic disease (fever, malaise, etc.)

Imaging: usually pedunculated mass, typically in left atrium (typically originate from interatrial septum)
Cine SSFP: often change position during cardiac cycle, and may cause valvular obstruction.
May have stalk&#8594; can prolapse through or obstruct atrioventricular valve

T1 SE: mass with intermediate signal intensity, similar to myocardium
Signal may vary due to calcifications (hypointense) or hemorrhage (hyperintense)

T2 SE: common increased T2-signal, often heterogeneous

GRE: myxomas usually hypointense to surrounding blood
They typically enhance heterogeneously

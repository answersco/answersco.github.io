title: "Spatial resolution: MM vs. radiography"
---
Spatial resolution&#8594; &#8593; MTF compared to general radiography systems
For analog systems, MQSA requirements specify a minimum of 11-13 line pairs/mm.
Digital systems&#8594; vendor-dependent performance, but lower spatial resolution (though better contrast resolution).
General radiography &#8594; 5-8 line pairs/mm are achievable 
ACR phantom: 
Film/screen: must show a minimum of 4 fibers, 3 speck/calcification groups, and 3 masses
Digital: 5 fibers, 4 speck/calcification groups, 4 masses (total score of 13)

title: "Malpractice"
---
-nurse acted outside scope of practice or standard of care
-the nurse failed to meet standards of care
-the patient/client was injured
-the nurse's actions caused the injury
-intent to injure need not be shown
-attorney does not need to show whether your intent was not to do harm, rather, did your actions harm the patient -- the nurse acted outside the standard of care
EX: patient choking, nurse decides to perform a tracheostomy - license does not allow this procedure, it was outside the scope of practice for nursing

-greatest legal concern for nursing practice
-does not have to be intentional
-occurs through commission or omission
-the central question in malpractice charge is: 
--Was the prevailing standard of care met?
-with standard of care reflects basic minimum level of prudent care
-common causes: burns, falls, failure to observe, medication errors, mistaken identity, failure to communicate, abandonment, loss or damage to patient's property, things left in patients, or lack of informed consent

4) Causation

EX. Post-op patient is to have vitals checked every 15 minutes, then 30, 45, etc. depending on hospital policy. If the nurse does not follow the policy and something happens to the patient, that is considered negligence and is subject to a malpractice suit

title: "Which of the following can interfere with ECG gating? A) Arrhythmias B) COPD C) Large T waves D) Magnetohydrodynamic effects E) All of the above"

E. Arrhythmias have a variable R-R interval, thus making gating difficult. COPD patients may have a low ECG signal due to increased distance from the chest wall to the heart. Large T waves may mimic R waves. Magnetohydrodynamic effects can be solved with vectocardiogram gating.

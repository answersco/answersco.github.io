title: "How does a circumcaval (retrocaval) ureter course?"
---
It's actually a developmental anomaly of the IVC and NOT the ureter!

Right ureter courses posterior to the IVC, then emerges to the right of the aorta, coming to lie anterior to the right iliac vessels
- Get right hydroureteronephrosis above the segment embracing the IVC
- Can cause MEDIALIZATION of the ureter

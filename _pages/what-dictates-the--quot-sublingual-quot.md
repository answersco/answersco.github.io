title: "What dictates the &quot;sublingual&quot; vs &quot;Submandibular&quot; space?"
---
*Mylohyoid line seprates the spread of infection btw sublingual (above, anterior mandibular teeth) and submandibular (below; posterior 2nd and 3rd molars)

- this is where the mylohyoid muscle attaches to the mylohyoid ridge on the mandible

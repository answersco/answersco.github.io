title: "The ice cream cone was invented in 1904."
---
It all started in 1904 at the St. Louis World's Fair when an ice cream vendor ran out of dishes for his ice cream. A man named Ernest Hamwi was selling waffles in the booth next door. He helped his neighbor out by making cone-shaped waffles to hold the ice cream. The rest, as they say, is history.

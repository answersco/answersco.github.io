title: "What system fundamentals differentiate Lean and Toyota Production Systems (TPS) from more common assembly line practices of overproducing at individual work steps?"

Answer: pull systems, just-in-time, and Kanban
Inventory or work accumulating in queue is a fundamental source of waste.
Pull systems (in theory): work to emulate one-piece flow where the next step of work on an item occurs immediately at the completion of the prior step, the prior step is not creating any more than the next step can handle, and the next step is not idly waiting on the prior step for work. In practice, this is managed by producing a small buffer of inventory and implementing alert systems (kanbans) that signal readiness for additional parts/work.

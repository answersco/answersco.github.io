title: "Pancreatic and renal transplant"
---
This can be done for severe type 1 DM
Things to remember:
Panc HEAD is supplied via the DONOR SMA via the inferior pancreaticduodenal A
Panc TAIL and BODY supplied via the donor SPLENIC artery 

Most common cause for transplant pancreas failure:
1. (Most common) = acute rejection, which can be seen as reversed diastolic flow on doppler'
2. (Second most) = donor splenic VEIN thrombosis (much more common for pancreatic transplants than splenic artery thrombosis) - this also can be seen as REVERSED diastolic flow 

SHRINKING TRANSPLANT = buzzword for chronic rejection

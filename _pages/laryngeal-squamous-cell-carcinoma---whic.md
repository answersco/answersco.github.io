title: "Laryngeal Squamous cell carcinoma - which type has the best outcome? What is a contraindication to ALL TYPES of laryngeal conservation surgery?"
---
Best outcome = Glottic (least lymphatics)
Least common = Subglottic (may be clinically silent til you get LNs)

Invasion of Cricoid cartilage (tumor on both sides) is a contraindication to all laryngeal conservation surgery

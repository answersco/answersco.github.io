A-mode &#8594; A for amplitude
Currently only used in ophthalmology
Generates a signal of amplitude given as a function of time

B-mode&#8594; B for brightness
Basically the conversion of A-line information to brightness-modulated dots on a display
Proportional relationship of brightness to the echo signal amplitude

M-mode&#8594; M for motion (standard US)
Used to display the echoes from a moving organ (e.g. heart valves) from a fixed transducer and beam position on the patient

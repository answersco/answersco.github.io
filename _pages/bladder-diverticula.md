M&gt;F
Most are acquired secondary to chronic outlet obstruction (prostate)
Associated with Ehlers Danlos
Typically arise from the lateral walls or near the ureteral orifices
Ureters typically deviate medially adjacent to a diverticulum
Hutch diverticulum: occurs at UVJ
Not associated with posterior urethral valves or neurogenic bladder
Associated with ipsilateral reflux.

Most are acquired secondary to chronic outlet obstruction (prostate)
Associated with Ehlers Danlos
Typically arise from the lateral walls or near the ureteral orifices
Ureters typically deviate medially adjacent to a diverticulum
Diverticula at the anterior/superior bladder are more likely to be urachal diverticula.

Hutch diverticulum: occurs at UVJ
Not associated with posterior urethral valves or neurogenic bladder
Associated with ipsilateral reflux.

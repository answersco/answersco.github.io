title: "2 major categories of MRA techniques:"

Dark blood&#8594; obtained using a spin-echo based technique where the moving blood experiences the 90&#176; pulse, but has moved out of the slice plane before experiencing the 180&#176; pulse.
&#8594; Thus, signal from the moving blood is not dephased&#8594; so it appears dark in the image.
Stationary tissue&#8594; experiences both the 90&#176; and 180&#176; pulses&#8594; so it appears bright relative to the moving blood.
Bright blood scans&#8594; obtained using a gradient-echo (GRE) pulse sequence.
The moving blood is &quot;fresh&quot; relative to the stationary tissue, which is saturated by repeated application of RF pulses.
&#8594; As a result, the fresh blood appears bright relative to the stationary tissue.

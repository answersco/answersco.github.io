Aortic coarctation:
Preductal&#8594; may cause CHF in infants due to LV obstruction
Juxtaductal or postductal&#8594; present later in life as upper extremity HTN
Associated with bicuspid aortic valve &#8594; may see aortic dilation proximal to site of coarctation.
Associated with Turner syndrome (XO)
In infants, aortic coarctation may produce acyanotic CHF
Adults&#8594; classic XR findings is the 3 sign, representing the contour of the coarcted aorta in the left upper mediastinum, rarely associated with rib notching.

Adult form: usually juxtaductal (at junction of ductus arteriosus), leading to upper extremity HTN.
Infant presenting with CHF due to coarctation is usually preductal, which functions as a LV obstructive lesion.
Prominent collateral vessels develop between the internal thoracic arteries to both the epigastric vessels and intercostal arteries.
XR: 3 sign of left upper heart border, representing a double bulge form the focal aortic narrowing and post-stenotic dilatation. Frequent rib notching from collateral intercostal vessels.
Phase contrast MRI: can be used to measure the gradient of flow across the coarctation, with calculation of flow differential between the proximal descending aorta and the aorta at the hiatus.

-Focal narrowing of upper thoracic aorta at level of insertion of ductus arteriosus (less commonly long segment or may be associated with diffuse tubular hypoplasia of aortic arch and isthmus)
-Cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascularity with edema may be present in infants
-\\\&quot;3\\\&quot; sign may be present
-Notching of undersurface of ribs may develop in longstanding severe cases
-Collateral flow best identified by CTA and MRA; can be quantified on MR

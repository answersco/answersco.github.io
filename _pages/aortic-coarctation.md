Associated with bicuspid aortic valve &#8594; may see aortic dilation proximal to site of coarctation.
Associated with Turner syndrome (XO)
In infants, aortic coarctation may produce acyanotic CHF
Adults&#8594; classic XR findings is the 3 sign, representing the contour of the coarcted aorta in the left upper mediastinum, rarely associated with rib notching.

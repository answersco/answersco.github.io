title: "Bit depth"
---
number of bits used to represent each pixel in the resolution
Practically speaking, this controls the numbers of shades of gray that can be displayed on a computer monitor
To figure out how many shades of gray can be displayed, do 2^(bit depth)
The MORE shades of gray that can be displayed, the BETTER the contrast resolution (think about it: you can determine that more things are different from one another)

title: "Percutaneous options for treatment of acute dissection"

Placement of a stent-graft over the entry tear has been shown to acutely depressurize the false lumen and restore normal flow dynamics to true lumen.
-Over time, there is thrombosis of false lumen adjacent to stent-graft in almost all cases, though the false lumen often remains patent distally.
-Proximal end of endograft should be placed in nondissected Ao when possible.

Large bare stents to reinforce true lumen and stabilize the intimal flap can be sued in combination with a proximal endograft to enhance remodeling of dissected Ao and preserve flow to visceral branches.

Percutaneous fenestration of the aortic flap (intentional creation of a large distal exit tear) can decompress the false lumen and relieve obstruction of true lumen, but is not longer first-line endovascular therapy due to high mortality.

title: "Reverse mismatch, Stripe sign, and fissure sign"
---
Reverse mismatch: normal perfusion with abnormal ventilation.
-Most commonly due to atelectasis
-Also seen with pleural effusion, PNA, cardiomegaly, and partial bronchial obstruction.

Stripe sign = perfusion abnormality with a zone of normally preserved peripheral lung
-Since PE is usually peripherally based, this is considered very low probability for PE

Fissure sign: curvilinear perfusion defects, corresponding to pleural fluid in the fissures

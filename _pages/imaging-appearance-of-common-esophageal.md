title: "Imaging appearance of common esophageal diverticula:"
---
Zenker diverticulum: outpouching from the posterior wall of the pharyngoesophageal junction, just above the cricopharyngeus muscle.
Usually starts at the C5 vertebral level.

Killian-Jamieson diverticulum: originates from the anterolateral wall of the cervical esophagus (higher, more anterior, and smaller than Zenker).

Traction Diverticulum
Usually mid esophagus near carina
Acquired due to adherence to subcarinal or perihilar granulomatous lymph nodes
Look for calcified nodes and granulomas in lungs

Pulsion Diverticulum
Saccular, often large, outpouching
Distal (epiphrenic) is most common
Strongly associated with esophageal motility disturbances (e.g., presbyesophagus, diffuse esophageal spasm)
Easily mistaken for a hiatal hernia and vice versa

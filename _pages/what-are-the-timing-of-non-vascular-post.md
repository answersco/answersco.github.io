Immediate: Hematoma/Seroma are normal post op sequella but may have mass effect on the transplant.

Early: Urine leak often at the ureterovesicle anastamosis resulting in urinoma with liquid discharge from the wound.

Early: Abscess should be considered whenever there is fever/leukocytosis.

Late: Lymphoceles usually occur 1-2mo post op and are asx.

Factors Affecting Spatial Resolution

1. FOV: smaller FOV&#8594; better resolution

2. Focal spot size: usually not an issue unless you get the anatomy away from the image receptor

3. Image Receptor Limitations: 
FPD : Detector Elements
II : TV

4. Motion and temporal factors&#8594; motion creates ghosting

5. Dynamic range: only an issue for II systems&#8594; variability in very dense or very transparent objects

6. Pixel binning: binning increases pixel size&#8594; reduced spatial resolution (but improves SNR)

7. Frame averaging: increases SNR, but more susceptible to blur

8. Pulsed fluoro: less motion artifact (better spatial resolution in moving objects) and overall less dose

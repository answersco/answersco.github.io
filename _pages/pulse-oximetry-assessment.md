title: "Pulse oximetry assessment"
---
-normal: 95 - 100%
-place light-emitting probe onto patient's finger or earlobe for 10-30 seconds
-indirect measurement of oxygen saturation in blood (noninvasive)
-direct measurement of oxygen saturation is an Arterial Blood Gas (ABG -- invasive)
-any reading less than 92% may be considered abnormal and indicate the oxygenation to tissues isnt adequate but look for easy answer like the probe is falling off before the hard answer

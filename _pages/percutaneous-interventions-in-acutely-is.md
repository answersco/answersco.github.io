title: "Percutaneous interventions in acutely ischemic but viable limbs: indications and objectives"
---
Percutaneous interventions in acutely ischemic but viable limbs (categories I, IIA, and IIB): indicated when surgery isn't necessary and embolic occlusion is unlikely.
-Objectives: rapidly restore flow and identify underlying lesions that can be corrected

-Pharm thrombolysis, mechanical thrombolysis, and aspiration thrombectomy are useful for both embolic and thrombotic occlusions
-Occlusions &lt;14 days old are amenable to pharm and mechanical thrombolysis. 
-Mechanical thrombectomy devices are very useful for rapid restoration of flow. Subsequent pharm thrombolysis may be used to clean up residual thrombus for optimal results.
-Aspiration thrombectomy: should be considered for acute (&lt;48 hours), especially those occurring as a complication of a revascularization procedure.

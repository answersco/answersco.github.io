---
Popliteal artery aneurysm = diameter &gt; 2 cm
-Bilateral in 50%
-M:F 15:1
-Concomitant CFA aneurysm in 40%
-40% with unilateral pop aneurysm have concurrent AAA
-3/4 with bilateral pop aneurysm have AAA
-Only 14% with AAA have pop aneurysm
-90% are degenerative. 
-Mural thrombus is common
-Exam: pop artery pulse feels generous. Distal pulses may be diminished or reduced. The entire pop artery may be aneurysmal, but focal aneurysms most often involve the vessel above the joint line.

Most feared complications: acute limb ischemia (25%) due to thrombosis and distal embo of mural thrombus. 
25% present with claudication
Can cause DVT

1) renin released in response to low blood getting to the kidneys
2) renin secreted by kidneys in response to low BP or decrease in Na+
3) renin converts angiotensinogen (from liver) to angiotensin I
4) angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II in the lungs by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
5) angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction &amp; stimulates secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex
6) aldosterone causes increased Na+ reabsorption by kidneys
-water follows Na+

essential to maintaining BP

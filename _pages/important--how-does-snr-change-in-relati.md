title: "IMPORTANT: How does SNR change in relation to Number of phase encoding steps, # of excitations, and receiver bandwidth?"
---
SNR increases with the square root of measurements (number of phase encoding steps, averages or number of excitations). 

SNR decreases with the square root of receive bandwidth (e.g. if you quadruple your receiver bandwidth, you halve your SNR - because you're sampling more noise!)

*While decreasing matrix size (increased pixel size) and increasing slice thickness will increase voxel volume and SNR, only decreasing matrix size in phase encoding direction will also decrease the imaging time for a single slice.

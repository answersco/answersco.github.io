title: "Hangman's C2 Fracture"
---
Classic imaging appearance
Fractures through C2 pars interarticularis
Anterior displacement of C2 vertebral body relative to C3
C1 arch and skull ride forward with C2 vertebral body
May not see malalignment despite pars interarticularis disruption
Posterior elements and spinolaminar line of C2 and C3 remain aligned
Flexion exaggerates C2-C3 subluxation
CT best defines morphology of fracture
Soft tissue swelling in upper prevertebral tissues common
Location
Both pars interarticularis of C2

-infiltration with tissue toxic substances

1) Vasopressors: constrict so not getting good blood flow; use small needle (22g) so there is still blood flow around the catheter
-Dobutamine, Dopamine, Epinephrine
-Antidote - phentolamine mesylate (Regitine) (5mg/9mlNS)
injecting the phentolamine all around the area to open circulation to entire area

2) Chemotherapeutic Agents:
-Adriamycin, Vincristine, Bleomycin etc.
-Apply cold so toxins are not further spread into surrounding tissues

3) Electrolytes: very painful/burning; check very often - at least every 30 minutes
-Potassium Chloride: turn rate down so it is not dripping as quickly, put it in with saline to help dilute it down a little, ask physician about adding lidocaine, put ice pack on it

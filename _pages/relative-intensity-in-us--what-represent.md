title: "Relative intensity in US: what represents a 50% decrease in intensity"
---
Relative intensity: recorded in decibels (dB) &#8594; based on a log10 scale
A change of 10 in dB scale corresponds to 2 orders of magnitude (100 times)
Reducing the sound intensity to 10% is -10 dB
Reducing to 1% is -20 dB
Reducing to 0.1% is -30 dB
A loss of 3 dB (-3 dB) represents a 50% loss of signal intensity (power)
The tissue thickness that reduces the US intensity by 3 dB is the half-value thickness

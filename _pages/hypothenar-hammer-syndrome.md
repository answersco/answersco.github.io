title: "Hypothenar hammer syndrome"
---
Blunt trauma (jackhammer) to hook of hamate
aneurysm formation to ulnar artery and superficial palmar arch
Distal emboli may occur
corkscrew superficial palmar arch
occlusion of the ulnar artery
pseudoaneurysm of the ulnar artery

Injury to ulnar artery as it crosses the hammate bone. Chronic causes intimal injury, thrombosis, aneurysm, etc.

Look for distal ulnar artery occlusion pseudoaneurysm, or narrowing. Due to repetitive trauma against hook of hamate

Chronic trauma to base of hand can result in intimal injury and aneurysm formation in the ulnar artery as it crosses the base of the metacarpals.
-Symptoms occur when the aneurysms or intimal irregularities thrombose or become a souce of distal emboli, characteristically to 3rd-5th fingers
-The complex is called HHS

Digital artery emboli with an ulnar artery aneurysm or focal ulnar occlusion at hypothenar eminence are diagnostic findings.

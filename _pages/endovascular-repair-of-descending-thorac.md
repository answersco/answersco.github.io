title: "Endovascular repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms: anatomic considerations"
---
Proximal landing zone: 1.5-2 cm of normal aorta distal to the left subclavian artery of left CCA
-If distance between left subclavian and aneurysm is &lt; 1.5 cm, the endograft can be placed across the left subclavian artery origin provided the left vertebral artery is in contiguity with the basilar artery.
-Elective cases, or when left vert ends in PICA: left carotid to subclavian artery bypass recommended before stent-graft coverage.

Distal landing zone: also want 1.5-2cm of normal aorta for the distal end of the graft above the celiac artery.
-Possible overlay of the celiac artery origin in cases of short distal landing zones requires patent SMA and pancreaticoduodenal arcade.

title: "Double aortic arch?"
---
Vascular ring with dysphagia, no innominate artery (subclavians and carotids come off separately)

This is the most common vascular RING 
On fluro you are going to see compressions on BOTH the trachea (anterior) and esophagus (posterior)

Most common SYMPTOMATIC vascular ring
Remember that on an esophagram this guy is going to have an anterior impression on the trachea and a posterior impression on the esophagus

Most common symptomatic vascular ring, makes anterior indentation on trachea and posterior on esophagus

-Both limbs usually complete, but 1 side may be atretic (30%) (atretic limb remains in fibrous continuity with descending aorta)
-Although variable, right limb is usually larger (dominant) and higher in position than left
-Most commonly: Left arch anterior and left of trachea, right arch posterior and right of esophagus (limbs join posteriorly to form left-sided descending aorta)
-Symptoms usually present early
-Radiograph may show dominant arch and compression of both sides of trachea
-Esophagram, AP view: compression on both sides of esophague
-Esophagram, lateral view: posterior impression
-CT and MR demonstrate relative sizes of limbs and degree of associated tracheal narrowing
-Rarely associated with intracardiac defects

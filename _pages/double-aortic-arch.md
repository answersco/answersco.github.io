title: "Double aortic arch?"
---
Vascular ring with dysphagia, no innominate artery (subclavians and carotids come off separately)

This is the most common vascular RING 
On fluro you are going to see compressions on BOTH the trachea (anterior) and esophagus (posterior)

Most common SYMPTOMATIC vascular ring
Remember that on an esophagram this guy is going to have an anterior impression on the trachea and a posterior impression on the esophagus

Most common symptomatic vascular ring, makes anterior indentation on trachea and posterior on esophagus

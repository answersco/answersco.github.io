Congenital true (epithelial) cyst: may cause elevation of tumor markers, including CA-19-9, CA-125, and CEA, despite its benign nature
Unlike a post-traumatic pseudocyst, a true cyst may have septations, but mural calcification is uncommon

Post-traumatic pseudocyst:
Appears as a well-circumscribed, fluid-intensity lesion with no peripheral enhancement.
In contrast to a true cyst, septations are uncommon, but there may be mural calcification.
Intrasplenic pancreatic pseudocyst has a similar appearance

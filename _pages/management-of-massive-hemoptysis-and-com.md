Massive hemoptysis (&gt;300 cc): bronchial artery embo is first-line therapy.
Active extravasation not typically seen- instead see tortuous, enlarged bronchial arteries.

Main thing to prevent is cord infarction- large spinal artery or radiomedullary branch from the target artery is a contraindication.
-&quot;Hairpin-shaped&quot; anterior medullary arteries are another contraindication (arise from the intercostal bronchial trunk in 10%).
-Particles are used (coils should be avoided due to rebleeding- exception is AVM and aneurysm).

Pulmonary artery is usually NOT the source of bleeding (unless a traumatic pseudoaneurysm from a Swan-Ganz catheter, pulmonary AVM [rec tx for aferrent vessel &gt; 3mm], or Rasmussen aneurysm from TB).

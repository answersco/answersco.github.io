Cholecystostomy: 2 percutaneous approaches
Transhepatic (more commonly performed): needle inserted in midaxillary line and directed towards bare area of the gallbladder fossa under US guidance.
&#8595; risk of peritoneal bile leak, but &#8593; risk of liver laceration
Transperitoneal: needle directed into GB from a subcostal approach, beneath the liver margin.
&#8595; risk of liver damage, but &#8593; risk of peritoneal bile leak.
Also requires penetration of the GB fundus, which is the most mobile portion.
Drainage tube must remain in place until the following criteria are met:
Patient is clinically improved (risk of sepsis with premature removal)
Cystic duct and CBD are demonstrated to be patent on repeat cholangiogram.
At least 6 weeks have passed since placement to allow a fibrous tract to develop. If tube is removed prematurely, there is risk of bile peritonitis.

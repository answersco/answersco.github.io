title: "Differential functional study: normal and abnormal flow"
---
Normal: flow begins within 20 seconds of injection, first seen in aorta, then renal arteries. Then the kidneys should enhance symmetrically and about equal to the aorta (at that time).

Decreased (symmetric): technical error (poor bolus)
Decreased (asymmetric): 
-Renal artery thrombosis
-Renal vein thrombosis
-Chronic high-grade obstruction
-Acute rejection
-Acute pyelonephritis

Increased (asymmetric)
-Renal artery aneurysm

ATN, interstitial nephritis, and cyclosporine toxicity will all have normal perfusion/flow

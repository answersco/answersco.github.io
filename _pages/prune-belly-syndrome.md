Prune belly syndrome&#8594; congenital muscular disorder that affects the abdominal wall musculature and smooth muscles of the urinary collecting system, and may be associated with cryptorchidism.
Dilation of entire collecting system, including bladder and both ureters (versus posterior urethral valves, in which only the posterior urethra is dilated).

Also called eagle barrett syndrome
Only in males:
1. Shit abdominal musculature
2. Hydroureteronephrosis
3. Cryptochidism (bladder distention interferes with decent of testes)

Malformation with crappy bladder outlet causing hydroureteronephrosis and big bladder. Also crappy abdominal wall muscles so their bellies protrude

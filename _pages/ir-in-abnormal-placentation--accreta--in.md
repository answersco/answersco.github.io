title: "IR in abnormal placentation (accreta, increta, percreta)"
---
Abnormal placentation requires post-partum hysterectomy due to uncontrollable bleeding in up to 25% of patients.
Placement of bilateral IIA balloon occlusion catheters before cesarian delivery allows intraoperative control of the hypogastric arteries.
The balloons are positioned from bilateral common femoral access into the contralateral IIAs and secured in place with sutures and tape.
A syringe with the predetermined occlusive volume is left attached to each balloon lumen so they can be quickly inflated if needed.

Most common embolic source is LA thrombus, with Afib as risk factor
Angiography: shows acute cutoff of the affected vessel, often with a meniscus sign. Significant athersclerotic disease may be absent.
Treatment: surgical embolectomy, bypass graft, or endovascular thrombolysis
Endovascular treatment: hydrophilic wire used to cross the lesion. 
Multi-sidehole infusion catheter is placed across the thrombus
tPA is infused at 0.5 mg/h for 48-72 hours; requires ICU care with regular monitoring of hematocrit and fibrinogen.
tPA should be slowed if fibrinogen &#8595; to &lt; 150 mg/dL and stopped if it reaches &lt; 100 mg/dL.

title: "Lysogenic cycle"
---
-cycle carried out by temperate phages
1) viral nucleic acid gets incorporated into bacterial chromosome which does not happen in lytic cycle
2) viral nucelic acid now called a prophage
3) no immediate synthesis, maturation, or release -- its a way for the virus to hang out in the bacterial chromosome
4) prophage duplicated along with bacterial chromosome as bacteria divide - it also synthesizes the viral genetic material and divide with the bacteria
5) &#8226; Viral DNA becomes latent as prophage
6) The viral DNA molecule is inserted at specific sites on the bacterial chromosome. The viral DNA is duplicated along with the regular genome and provide adaptive genes for the host bacterium
7) Can go on for multiple amount of divisions 
8) Due to some kind of event can become active again and enters back into lytic cycle

title: "Critical zone in design of magnetic fringe field:"
---
The critical factor in the zonal design is the location of the so-called 0.5 mT boundary
The 0.5 mT (5 Gs) limit&#8594; adopted by FDA as a safety boundary defining the restricted access space of the MRI scanner
Fringe field strength is inversely proportional to r3 
r = distance from magnet's isocenter

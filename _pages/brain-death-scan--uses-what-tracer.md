title: "Brain death scan, uses what tracer?"
---
Tc99m-DTPA
- Requires good bolus technique, adequate cardiac output, and only evals anterior circulation 

- But actually, HMPAO and ECD are preferred because easy to interpret, brain specific, and not dependent on good IV bolus
- More adequate evaluation of the cerebellum and brainstem

* Tracer can still be seen in epidural hematoma even if they're braindead
* Tracer can also still be seen in venous sinuses in a positive brain death scan

title: "Collateral drainage in setting of hepatic vein obstruction"

Obstruction of the main HVs frequently results in intrahepatic collateralization to other hepatic veins.
If at least one HV remains patent, obstruction of main HVs is usually well tolerated.

Collateral drainage through capsular and diaphragmatic veins may also occur.

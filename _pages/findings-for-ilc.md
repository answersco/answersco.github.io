title: "Findings for ILC?"

ILC = cells lose e-cadherin --&gt; infiltrate breast like web of a spider without desmoplastic rxn so missed
- architectural distortion with &quot;Dark star&quot; appearance and no discrete central mass

- US- ill defined area of shadowing without a discrete mass
- &quot;shrinking breast&quot; = breast isn't actually smaller, it just doesn't COMPRESS AS MUCH!
- compared with IDC, ILC is more often multifocal, less mets to axilla but rather to weird places like peritoneum, more likely positive margins, treated with mastectomy
- older population; seen best on CC view b/c of better compression
- less common washout on MRI
- similar prognosis to IDC!
- plemorphic ILC is very bad and aggressive
* 1/3 are bilateral!

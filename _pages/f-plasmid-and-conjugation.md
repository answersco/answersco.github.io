title: "F plasmid and conjugation"
---
-pilus connects cells F+ and F- together
-F Factor begins replication and transfer
-F+ donor is copying plasmid and while this is happening, the plasmid is being threaded through the hollow tube to F-
-F Factor replicated and transferred, creating two F+ cells meaning it has picked up a copy of that plasmid
-conjugation pilus degrades and falls apart after transfer is complete

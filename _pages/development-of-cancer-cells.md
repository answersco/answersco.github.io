title: "Development of cancer cells"
---
1) cell acquires a mutation for repeated cell division
2) new mutations arise, and one cell has the ability to start a tumor
3) cancer insitu - the tumor is at its place of origin
-one cell mutates further
-cancer cells make a collagenous base to infect and break down the basement membrane
4) cells invade underlying tissues by producing a proteinase enzyme
5) cancer cells now have the ability to invade lymphatic and blood vessels
6) new metastatic tumors are found some distance from the original tumor

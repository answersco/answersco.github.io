title: "Otosclerosis"

Otosclerosis is a genetically mediated metabolic bone disease of unknown etiology.
It is sometimes called otospongiosis because the disease begins with an otospongiotic phase, which is followed by an otosclerotic phase when osteoclasts are replaced by osteoblasts and dense sclerotic bone is deposited in areas of previous bone resorption. 
When this process involves the oval window in the region of the footplate, the footplate becomes fixed, resulting in conductive hearing loss.
Conductive hearing loss develops early in the third decade and is considered to be the hallmark of the disease. 
However, involvement of other portions of the otic capsule can result in mixed sensorineural hearing loss. 
The process starts in the region of the oval window, classically at the fissula ante fenestram, i.e. in front of the oval window (fenestral otosclerosis). 
It can also occur around the cochlea (retrofenestral otosclerosis).

There is a subtle otosclerotic focus in the characteristic site: the fissula ante fenestram (arrows).

Fenestral otosclerosis: around oval window, with fixation of the stapes; conductive hearing loss

Cochlear (retrofenestral) otosclerosis: involves cochlea and otic capsule.

Remember to be thinking about separation in SPACE (different location in the brain) and TIME (different phases of lesion development)

Classic findings:
- T2/FLAIR periventricular perpendicular = dawson's fingers
- involvement of the colloso-septal interface = 98% specific for MS (helps distinguish between vascular and ADEM) (SEE IMAGE for the interface) 
- Cervical spine is most common involved spinal location
- FLAIR more sensitive for juxacortical and periventricular lesions
- T2 more sensitive for intratentorial lesions
- MR spectroscopy will show REDUCED NAA peaks within the lesions

Active vs nonactive: active should enhance and restrict diffusion

-T2/FLAIR oval, periventricular lesions (&quot;Dawson fingers&quot;)
-callososeptal involvement (vs ADEM)
-acute phase: enhancement and restricted diffusion
-tumefactive: ring-enhancing
-spine lesions: peripheral, short segment, unilateral, cervical

-associated with Graves and myasthenia gravis

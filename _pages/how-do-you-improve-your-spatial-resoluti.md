title: "How do you improve your spatial resolution in MRI (in regards to slice thickness, voxel size, matrix size, FOV, slice select gradient, and transmit bandwidth)?"
---
Thinner slice 
- Therefore, higher SSG slope &amp; thin transmit bandwidth

Voxel size - Smaller
Matrix - BIGGER (gives smaller voxel)
Gradient - higher amplitude (more intense) or applied for longer
FOV - Smaller (F = PM)
- but smaller FOV risks aliasing

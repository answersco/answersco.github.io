title: "What is the imaging protocol for Ga-67? Timing, photopeaks, collimation, and concurrent use with Tc?"
---
Imaging is usually at 48-72 hours after renal clearance.
Photopeaks are 93, 184, 296 keV. Medium energy collimation is used. Tc scans should be performed after Ga-67 scans to prevent down-scatter of 140keV to 93 keV. Alternatively, can only image at 184 and 296 keV.

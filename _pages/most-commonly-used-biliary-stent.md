Most popular metallic biliary stent is the Wallstent
-Self-expanding stainless steel mesh
-Preferred length for biliary tree is 9 cm, with 1 cm diameter.
-Flexible delivery system with small delivery catheter (7-Fr).
-Stent has a large luminal diameter (1 cm)
-The stent deploys from distal to proximal, and tends to move forward a little as it deploys. It is thus important to reposition the delivery catheter during stent deployment.

Gianturco is the 2nd most popular

Covered stents can also be used in the lower CBD rather than the hilum so that side branches are not covered.

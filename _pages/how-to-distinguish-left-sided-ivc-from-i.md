title: "How to distinguish left-sided IVC from interrupted IVC with hemiazygos continuation?"
---
1. Left sided IVC will cross back over to normal right side above level of renal veins (assoc Renal abnormalities)

2. Interrupted = hepatic veins drain directly into the RA and blood from legs and abdomen into an enlarged left-sided hemiazygos vein (assoc POLYSPLENIA)

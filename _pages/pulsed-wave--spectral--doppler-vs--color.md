title: "Pulsed wave (spectral) Doppler vs. color Doppler"
---
Pulsed wave (spectral): blood flow velocity varies, yielding a spectrum of doppler shifts rather than a single frequency.
-Can obtain direction of flow (plotted above and below baseline) and velocity.

Color doppler: uses the grayscale image with a superimposed color blood flow image
-Gives direction of flow with colors
-Color intensity varies depending on flow intensity (things that aren't moving are gray).
-Obtains samples of each pixel multiple times, then displays the average shift.
-Spatial resolution less than that of grayscale imaging (though smaller vessels are better seen).
-Doppler angle not as important since info is semi-quantitative.

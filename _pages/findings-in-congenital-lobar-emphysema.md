Congenital lobar emphysema (CLE) &#8594; hyperlucent and hyperexpanded lobe in neonate
Lobar predilection: LUL &gt; RML &gt; RUL &gt;&gt; lower lobes
Mass effect: compression of adjacent lung, mediastinal shift, persistent hyperinflation in ipsilateral decubitus position. 
50% may have visible cause (i.e. extrinsic compression from a foregut duplication cyst), while the remaining cases are probably due to malacia or stenosis of the bronchial cartilage.

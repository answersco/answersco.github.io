Procedural: usually related to extracapsular puncture, or extrahepatic puncture of PV and angioplasty with massive bleeding.
-Hemobilia

Acute post-procedural:
Worsened hepatic encephalopathy (20-30%)
Accelerated hepatic failure (1-5%)
Cardiac decompensation
Hemolysis (10%, and less common with modern covered stent).
Less common: portal vein thrombosis, stent migration, infection, renal failure (contrast)

Late:
Ascites (10-30%)- overall improved survival but increased encephalopathy compared to medical therapy.
Recurrent variceal bleeding (bare stent) (15-25% at 1 year)
Shunt stenosis (bare stent) (50% 1 year)

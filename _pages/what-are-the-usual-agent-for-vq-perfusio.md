title: "What are the usual agent for VQ perfusion? When to alter the number of particles?"
---
Perfusion: Tc99m MAA (10-100 microns) about 200-500k particles total

- reduce particles to 100k for children, Pulm HTN, Right to left shunt (don't want in brain), and pregnancy (still the same dose though!)

- Half life decreases as the scan time goes, but # of particles STAYS CONSTANT

* No need to reduce for COPD!

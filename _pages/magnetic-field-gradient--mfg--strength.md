title: "Magnetic field gradient (MFG) strength, and effects of higher maximum MFG strength"
---
Gradient strength&#8594; critical in assessing the robustness of the MFG hardware.
MFG strength uses units of 1 milliTesla per meter (1 mT/m)
Describes an MFG that &#8593; the strength of the static magnetic field by one mT per every meter of distance traveled from the system isocenter in the direction of the gradient.
Maximum MFG strength should be specified for only a single channel (i.e. only one gradient coil activated at a time)
Advantage of a system with higher maximum MFG strength &#8594; the ability to write and execute faster scanning protocols.
Applicable to breath-hold applications and real-time (e.g. cardiovascular) imaging.
Disadvantage of very high gradient strength&#8594; potential impact on patient safety (induction of peripheral nerve stimulation).

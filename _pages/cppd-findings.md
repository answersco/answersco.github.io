title: "CPPD findings:"
---
Rhomboid crystals of CPPD are positively birefringent.
Rare in patients under 50.
Crystal deposition may be idiopathic or associated with hemochromatosis, hyperparathyroidism, or hypophosphatasia.
XR hallmark&#8594; chondrocalcinosis (calcification of hyaline [articular] or fibrocartilage [meniscal]).
Wrist&#8594; chondrocalcinosis tends to affect the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC)
Advanced disease&#8594; may lead to scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC) wrist: proximal migration of the capitate between the dissociated scaphoid and lunate &#8594; may also be seen in RA and trauma.
Hands: typical involvement of the 2nd and 3rd MCP joints &#8594; produces characteristic hook-like or drooping osteophytes from the radial aspect of the metacarpal heads (similar findings as in hemochromatosis, which typically features more extensive involvement of MCPs).
Knee&#8594; patellofemoral compartment affected first, but all compartments may become involved.
Isolated degenerative changes of patellofemoral joint are highly suggestive of CPPD, as are prominent subchondral cysts.

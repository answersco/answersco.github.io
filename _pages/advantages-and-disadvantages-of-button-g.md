title: "Advantages and disadvantages of button gastrostomy"
---
Advantages:
-Avoidance of catheter clogging due to short tube length.
-Low-profile tube: less likely to pull out

Disadvantages:
-It's a balloon-retention device- the balloon eventually bursts, lasting on average 3-6 months. Can be replaced at bedside with similar device.
-Mature tract of at least 3 months &quot;required&quot; before insertion of gastrostomy button. The balloon-retaining devices can be placed de novo without a mature tract, while the mushroom-retaining device cannot.

title: "Lobar holoprosencephaly"
---
Partial absence of frontal interhemispheric fissure. Absent septum pellucidum and relatively normal brain overlap with SOD. Body and splenium of corpus callosum are usually present with genu and rostrum absent (dysgenic corpus callosum).

-The least severe form of the holoprosencephaly
- Absence of the septum pellucidum
- This is a failure to CLEAVE
- Brain cleavage happens form back to front (so this is just a failure to cleave the front)
- The thalami are almost COMPLETELY SEPERATE
- Basically you just have fusion of the anterior horns of the ventricles (which means you know NO septum pellucidum)

-absent septum pellucidum
-pituitary issues
-hemispheres are separate

Almost normal. Think absent septum pellucidum and possibly some uncleaved inferior frontal part

Dilated cardiomyopathy: represents concentric ventricular chamber enlargement with impaired systolic function, typically involving both ventricles.
Can be ischemic or idiopathic etiology, often distinguished via MRI or CT.
Ischemic cause: suggested by delayed enhancement in a vascular distribution on MRI or coronary disease on CCTA.
Up to 41% of patients with idiopathic DCM demonstrate abnormal enhancement in a nonischemic distribution in the mid-ventricular wall, of uncertain significance.

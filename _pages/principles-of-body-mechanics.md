1) always assess the situation before acting.
-know what is going on in the pt's room, know ambulatory status and participation level the pt is capable is
2) work at the appropriate height.
-do not bend down over pt
-bring the bed up to hip level
3) wide base of support.
-whether it be a boost up from bed or going from the standing to sitting or vise versa bc it helps with balance and better assisting
4) lower the center of gravity.
5) face the direction of movement.
6) use leverage, rolling, turning and pivoting instead of lifting.
-EX. Log rolling when changing sheets or putting bed pan under pt
7) use arm and leg muscles
-not back muscles.
-bend knees to give more momentum rather than using back for most weight
8) reduce friction.
-draw sheets, under pads, moisture pads - sheering or rubbing up against the sheets
9) move on a level surface.
10) use mechanical aides. 
-trapezes and overhead hydraulic lifts

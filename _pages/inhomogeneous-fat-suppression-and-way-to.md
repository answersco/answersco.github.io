title: "Inhomogeneous fat suppression and way to improve"
---
Inhomogeneous fat suppression: 
-Local field inhomogeneities cause fat protons to precess at different frequencies- allows certain areas of fat to resist suppression
-Can mimic edema

Improved by using inversion recovery (STIR), especially in the setting of metal.

title: "Paratracheal and tracheal stripes:"
---
Right and left paratracheal stripes: formed by 2 layers of pleura where the medial aspect of each lung abuts the lateral wall of the trachea and intervening mediastinal fat.
Most commonly seen landmark, in up to 97% of normal PA XR
Thickening of right paratracheal stripe: most commonly due to pleural thickening, although a paratracheal or tracheal mass (including LAD or thyroid or tracheal neoplasm) can also be a cause
Thickening of left paratracheal stripe: similar differential, with the addition of mediastinal hematoma in setting of trauma.

Posterior tracheal stripe: only interface seen on lateral XR
Represents the interface of the posterior wall of the trachea with the 2 pleural layers of the medial right lung.

title: "Amorphous or indistinct calcification:"
---
Amorphous or indistinct calcification&#8594; too small or hazy for detailed assessment
Diffuse scatter amorphous calcification &#8594; usually benign, though magnification needed to rule out suspicious clusters.
Amorphous calcification in a clustered, regional, linear, or segmental distribution is more suspicious and warrants biopsy.

title: "Variant biliary anatomy"

Standard anatomy in 57%, with wide # of variations.
-Variations that most affect biliary drainage involve anomalous drainage of the RPD and RAD
-The RPD may drain into the LHD (16%) close to the hilum or at some distance from the hilum (5%).
-Less commonly the RHD can drain into the LHD.
-Occasionally the RAD, RPD, and LHD form a triple confluence, so there is no RHD.
-In patients with hilar obstruction with anomalous drainage of RPD into the LHD, left-sided drainage drains most of the liver.
-Often, if the RPD drains anomalously into the LHD, a very acute angle may be formed by junction of the RPD with the LHD, making passage of wires/catheters difficult.

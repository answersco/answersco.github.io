stone in cystic duct compresses common hepatic duct
type 1- simple obstruction
type 2- cholecystocholedochal fistula
diagnose stone at cystic duct prior to surgery

Common hepatic duct is obstructed secondary to an impacted cystic duct stone &#8594; can eventually erode through CHD or into GI tract.
Increased co-incidence of GB cancer
More common in people with low insertion of the cystic duct.

Obstruction of the common hepatic duct due to a stone impacted in the Cystic duct. It happens when the cystic duct and common hepatic duct run a parallel course and the edema and inflammation surrounding the obstructed cystic duct affect the adjacent common hepatic duct. The gallbladder displays sonographic signs of acute cholecystitis.

two cases with impacted cystic duct stones compressing and obstructing CBD- need to know prior to surgery so wrong duct isnt cut. note; anatomic relationship on left image w pt in sag position

Extrahepatic biliary obstruction due to an impacted stone in the cystic duct, causing extrinsic mechanical compression of the common hepatic duct

Rare form of biliary ductal obstruction that arises from obstruction of the HEPATIC duct from a CYSTIC duct stone
It is important to note that the risk of GB cancer is 5x higher in these patients

Common hepatic duct obstructed by a stone in the cystic duct5x higher risk of co-incident GB cancerOccurs more in people wiht a low cystic duct insertion

Common hepatic duct obstruction secondary to impacted cystic duct stone. 5x increased risk of gallbladder cancer!

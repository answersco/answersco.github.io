-most meds dose based on weight - always used kg
-body surface area may also be used (better because it takes into account body composition rather than just weight**)
-IV route more predictable than other routes
-must know developmental and cognitive differences for age
-use appropriate drug references for child
-teach safety, involve family, 
-caution for OTC meds taken by mother &amp; breastfeeding bc it is also what they are giving their children

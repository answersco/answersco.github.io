title: "Actual focal spot vs. apparent focal spot, and &quot;line-focus principle&quot;"
---
Actual focal spot: where the x-rays land on the target anode
Apparent focal spot: where the x-rays land on the patient
Defines the amount of blur

Line-Focus Principle: method of angling the anode to give a smaller apparent focal spot (and less blur)

Changes in angle: goal of smallest possible focal spot (best resolution) as allowed by heat tolerance.
Larger anode angle&#8594; larger surface area, bigger apparent focal spot
Smaller angle&#8594; smaller surface area (less heat tolerance), smaller apparent focal spot

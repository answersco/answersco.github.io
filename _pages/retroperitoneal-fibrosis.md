title: "Retroperitoneal fibrosis"
---
Idiopathic (Ormond's disease)
Medications: methysergide, ergotamine, methyldopa
Radiation , surgery
Desmoplastic reaction to tumors: HD &gt; NHL &gt; anaplastic carcinoma, mets

DDX: inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm

active inflammation is hyperintense on T2

Retroperitoneal fibrosis: rare inflammatory disorder causing &#8593; fibrotic deposition in retroperitoneum&#8594; often leads to ureteral obstruction
Unlike malignant retroperitoneal LAD, retroperitoneal fibrosis tends NOT to elevate the aorta off the spine

idiopathic, malign, drugs, AAA

80% idiopathic (Ormond's disease)
Other causes: XRT, meds (methyldopa, ergotamine, methysergide), inflammatory causes (pancreatitis, pyelonephritis, inflammatory aneurysm), and malignancy (desmoplastic reaction, lymphoma)
Associated with IgG4 disorders (autoimmune pancreatitis, Riedel's thyroiditis, inflammatory pseudotumor).
Classically shown as medial deviation of the ureters.
More common in men.
10% with associated malignancy
Fibrosis is gallium avid and PET-hot in early stages, and cold in late stages &#8594; metabolically active RP fibrosis is PET and Gallium positive regardless of etiology.

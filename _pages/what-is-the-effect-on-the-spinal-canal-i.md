title: "What is the effect on the spinal canal in a patient with bilateral pars defects and grade II anterolisthesis?"
---
Answer: the canal is widened
In most patients the spinal canal is widened as the posterior elements are separated from the anteriorly-displaced vertebral body.
Anterolisthesis is usually associated with neural foraminal stenosis.

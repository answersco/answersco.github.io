title: "Fluoro findings in Crohn's"
---
Fluoroscopy and endoscopy have better spatial resolution and sensitivity for early signs of disease than CT/MRI
Fluoroscopic findings: thickened, nodular folds, luminal narrowing, mucosal ulceration, and separation of bowel loops with cobblestone appearance
Fibrostenotic subtype: asymmetric bowel fibrosis from ulcerations of the mesenteric side of the bowel produces pseudosacculations on the antimesenteric side
Can lead to segmental stricture&#8594; string sign

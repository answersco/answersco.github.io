title: "Bias in screening: Lead-time bias"
---
Lead-time bias: lead-time is the period between the detection of a disease by screening and when it would be diagnosed because symptoms had developed
When lead time is short&#8594; treatment of disease found by screening is likely to be no more effective than treatment after symptoms appear
If early treatment is no more effective than treatment at clinical presentation, lead-time bias can be seen &#8594; time from diagnosis to death is longer for those screened, but survival is not improved (diagnosed time is longer but death occurs at the same time as those unscreened).
An appropriate way to avoid lead-time bias is to compare age-specific mortality rates, rather than survival rates from the time of diagnosis

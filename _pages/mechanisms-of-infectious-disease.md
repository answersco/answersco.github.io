1) Gain access to host: skin, GI tract, respiratory tract, urogenital tract, endogenous tract
2) Multiply and attach within host: fimbriae, capsules, surface proteins, viral spikes, hooks
3) Overcome host defense mechanisms - immune system: avoiding phagocytosis, avoiding death inside phagocytosis, evading actions of the immune system
4) Physiologic Effect/Damage host tissues - alter how a cell works: direct damage (toxins, enzymes, lysis) and indirect damage (host response is inappropriate and excessive
5) Exit the host

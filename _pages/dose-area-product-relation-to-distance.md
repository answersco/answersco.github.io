title: "Dose area product relation to distance (IR fluoro)"

DAP is INDEPENDENT on distance
Although as you get further away the intensity of the beam drops however the AREA of the beam cross section INCREASES 

REMEMBER: magnification will INCREASE your Air Kerma but WILL NOT increase the DAP (dose area product)

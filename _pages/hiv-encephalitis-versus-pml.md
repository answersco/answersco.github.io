title: "HIV encephalitis versus PML"
---
HIV encephalitis: usually CD4 &lt; 200
Symmetric T2 hyperintensity in deep white matter
Normal T1, no enhancement
+/- associated atrophy
Spare subcortical U-fibers (versus PML)

PML: CD4 &lt; 50
Single or multiple scattered hypodensities with corresponding T1 hypointensity (versus normal T1 in HIV)
T2 hyperintensities out of proportion to mass effect
Predilection for subcortical U-fibers
Asymmetry helps distinguish from HIV encephalitis

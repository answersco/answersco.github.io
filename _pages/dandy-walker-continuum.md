&quot;Classic&quot; DWM
Cystic dilatation of 4th ventricle &#8594; enlarged PF
Vermis hypoplastic, rotated superiorly
HVR
Variable vermian hypoplasia
PF/brainstem normal-sized
No or small cyst, &quot;keyhole&quot; vallecula
BPC
&quot;Open&quot; 4th ventricle communicates with cyst
Fastigial recess, primary fissure, PF/brainstem normal
MCM
Enlarged pericerebellar cisterns communicate with basal subarachnoid spaces
Occipital bone may appear scalloped/remodeled with all DWS types (including MCM)
Routine MR imaging (thin sagittal views crucial)

The enlarged posterior fossa, cystic dilatation of the 4th ventricle that is continuous dorsally with a large midline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cyst, and hypoplastic vermis that is rotated superiorly over the cyst are classic findings of Dandy-Walker malformation.

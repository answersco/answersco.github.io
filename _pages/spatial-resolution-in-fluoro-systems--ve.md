I.I. system: spatial resolution limited by TV display system
Resolution of the TV depends on raster (scan) lines, the bandwidth, and the FOV.
FPD system spatial resolution not limited by the display (usually have displays with same matrix as the image receptor)
The pure spatial resolution of II systems is better than for FPD, and change with FOV

Vertical resolution: limited by the # of raster lines that the display monitor uses
Max # of line pairs in the vertical direction is half the # of actual lines used
Bars in the line-pair pattern may not totally line up with the raster lines&#8594; the resolution usually less than predicted&#8594; correct with Kell factor (0.7)
Vertical resolution = (raster lines x Kell factor) / (2 x FOV in mm)
Thus, &#8595; FOV (mag mode) improves spatial resolution

Horizontal resolution: 
The # of dots per line must be calculated indirectly from bandwidth
The # of line pairs in the horizontal direction is &#189; the dots in a raster line

Measuring the spatial resolution at a diagonal (45 degrees to the raster lines)
Improves spatial resolution by a factor of &#8730;2 over the vertical or horizontal resolution

title: "Sarcoidosis: XR findings"
---
Sarcoidosis: noncaseating granulomatous disease
Pulmonary sarcoidosis: may progress to pulmonary fibrosis with honeycombing
Unlike IPF, the fibrotic changes of sarcoid have a mid and upper-lung predominance, similar to end-stage HST pneumonitis.
Historical staging system for XR findings (not always stepwise progression)
Stage 0: normal CXR
Stage 1: hilar or mediastinal adenopathy only, without lung changes
Stage 2: adenopathy with lung changes
Stage 3: diffuse lung disease without adenopathy
Stage 4: end-stage fibrosis
Most common XR finding: symmetric adenopathy
Lymph nodes may contain stippled or eggshell calcification in up to 50%
1-2-3 sign: right paratracheal adenopathy (&quot;1&quot;), right hilar adenopathy (&quot;2&quot;), and left hilar adenopathy (&quot;3&quot;).
Donut sign: seen on lateral XR, with adenopathy circumferentially encircling the trachea.

-absence of cranial vault above orbits

b/l absence of calvarium, lethal, AFP hi, angiomatous stroma

Lack of cerebral cortex and calvarium above the orbits, lethal.
Elevated AFP
Polihydramnios due to impaired swallowing. 
Angiomatous stroma- residual neural tissue may give impression of encephalocele

This is complete absence of the cerebrum and often the cerebellum
Look for the frog eye sign on neonatal ultrasound
This is NOT compatible with life
You will have ELEVATED AFP and POLYhydramnios

Most common neural tube defect
COMPLETE absence of the cranial vault and brain above the level of the orbits

-absence of cortical tissue
-elevated AFP
-polyhydramnios
-&quot;frog eye&quot;

-absence of cortical tissue, no falx
-elevated AFP
-polyhydramnios
-&quot;frog eye&quot;

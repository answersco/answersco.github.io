title: "Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome?"
---
Disorder of vasogenic edema with a posterior circulation predominance, caused by loss of autoregulation, resultant hyperperfusion, most commonly caused by acute hypertension.

Symmetric subcortical and cortical vasogenic edema within parietooccipital lobes. Temporary failure of autoregulation of cerebral arteries. Associations: Cyclosporin A or tacrolimus (FK506). Acute renal failure/uremia. Hemolytic uremic syndrome. Eclampsia. Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura. Chemotherapy (interferon).

PRES
Features: asymmetric cortical and subcortical white matter edema most obvious within the occipital lobes and parietal lobes (both CORTEX and WHITE MATTER are affected)
Important: PRES does NOT restrict diffusion (this helps differentiate from a stroke)

-failed auto regulation
-acute hypertension and chemo
-SYMMETRIC cortical and subcortical edema in parietooccipital lobes
-thalami, brainstem can be involved
-gyriform enhancement
-NO restricted diffusion

Causes: 
- HTN and chemotherapy (most common)
- eclampsia, DIC, TTP, septicemia, uremic encephalopathy

Imaging:
- ASYMMETRIC cortical and subcortical white matter edema (parieto-occipital)

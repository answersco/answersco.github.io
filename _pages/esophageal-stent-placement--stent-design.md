-May be used for palliation in esophageal carcinoma 
-Prior rigid plastic endoprostheses were difficult to insert and associated with high complication rate.
-Self-expanding stents have emerged as an attractive alternative. Almost all are totally or partially covered stents made from nitinol or other flexible material. 
-Many have antireflux valves or retrievable design for endoscopic removal.
-Flared proximal and/or distal ends can help prevent stent migration, particularly with placement at GE junction.
-GE junction strictures also improved with uncovered stents or conical stents with internal covering.
-Covered stents should always be used for patients with esophageal fistula and non-GE-jx strictures.
-Stent should have sufficient overlap above and below stricture.
-Stent is dilated in place with a 12 or 15-mm balloon.

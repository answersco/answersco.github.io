title: "What is bronchial atresia? How does it classically appear?"
---
Congenital atresia of a proximal segmental bronchus with histologically normal distal architecture.

Presents as a hilar mass or tubular branching mass (&quot;finger-in-glove due to mucoid impaction of dilated bronchi) with hyperinflated lung distally, usually LUL.

Neonates and infants may present with atelectatic, fluid-filled segment that gradually fills with air, through collateral aeration.

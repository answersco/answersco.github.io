Benign non-aneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage: around midbrain and pons WITHOUT extension into the lateral Sylvian cisterns or interhemispheric fissure (anterior to brainstem)

NOT associated with aneurysm, and may be associated with venous bleed.

Just think about blood within the basal cisterns ONLY
Excellent prognosis
Normally not associated with aneurysm
This blood is in the subarachnoid space

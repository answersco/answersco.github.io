title: "Phases of cardiac cycle"
---
In a resting person:
-atrial systole lasts about 0.1 second
-ventricular systole lasts about 0.3 seconds
-quiescent period, when all four chambers are in diastole, lasts about 0.4 second

-total duration of the cardiac cycle is therefore 0.8 seconds in a heart beating 75 bpm

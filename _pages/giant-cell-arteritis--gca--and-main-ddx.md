Giant cell arteritis (GCA): medium and large-vessel vasculitis that has overlapping imaging findings with Takayasu arteritis
GCA tends to affect older patients (generally &gt; 50 years) than does Takayasu.
Medium-sized upper extremity arteries are most commonly affected in GCA, including the subclavian, axillary, and brachial arteries.
Aorta is rarely involved (unlike Takayasu)
GCA typically produces long, smooth stenoses and occlusions.
Diagnosis: temporal artery biopsy
Treatment: steroids.

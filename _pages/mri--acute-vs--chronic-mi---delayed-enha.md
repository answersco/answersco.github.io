title: "MRI: acute vs. chronic MI - delayed enhancement - myocardial thickness - T2 signal intensity - Microvascular Obstruction"
---
- Delayed enhancement: both

Myocardial Thickness:
- acute: normal thickness
- chronic: thinned myocardium

T2 Signal Intensity:
- acute: bright (edema)
- chronic: dark (scar)

- Microvascular obstruction only in acute/subacute (NOT seen in chronic infarction)

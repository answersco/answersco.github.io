Hepatic iron overload:
Iron-overloaded liver is hypointense relative to paraspinal muscles on all MRI sequences.
Hemochromatosis: accumulation within hepatocytes, most common cause
Genetic defect causing &#8593; absorption of iron&#8594; treat with phlebotomy
Iron can't be stored in RES&#8594; spleen and BM are normal
&#8593; iron deposited in hepatocytes, pancreas, myocardium, skin, and joints
May lead to cirrhosis

Hemosiderosis: uptake within the RES causes hepatic Kupffer cell iron overload. Treated with iron chelators
May be due to frequent blood transfusions or defective erythrocytosis
RES has a large capacity for iron&#8594; liver typically normal in morphology without cirrhosis
MRI: demonstrates hypointense liver on conventional sequences, similar to hemochromatosis.
Spleen and BM will also appear hypointense due to &#8593; iron stores
Hemosiderosis&#8594; may lead to secondary hemochromatosis, which can lead to cirrhosis.

title: "What are the sentinel nodes for left and right-sided testicular cancer?"
---
Testicular lymphatic drainage follows the testicular veins.
Right-testis: sentinel nodes are those in the aortocaval chain at the level of the 2nd lumbar vertebral body.
Left testis: sentinel nodes are usually those in the left paraaortic nodal group just below the left renal vein.

title: "What is shimming, and in what clinical circumstances does poor shimming often become evident?"
---
Shimming&#8594; the process of improving the homogeneity of the magnetic field inside a large magnet &#8594; 2 categories: active and passive

Normally difficult to detect poor shimming, as it presents as geometric distortions that are hard to detect visually. 

Exception: Applications that require precise geometric localization (e.g. robotic surgery or XRT planning) &#8594; here, geometric distortions can become glaring.

Poor shimming is also more easily recognized in applications that rely on very high homogeneity to produce acceptable image quality&#8594; such as all fat-saturation techniques; or image protocols that rely on EPI acquisition schemes, such as DWI.

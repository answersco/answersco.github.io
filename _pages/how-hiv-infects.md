title: "How HIV infects"
---
1) virus binds via CD4 receptor &amp; enters
2) capsid releases RNA and enzymes
3) reverse transcriptase converts RNA into Viral DNA
4) integrase cuts and inserts viral DNA into genomic DNA
5) viral DNA transcribed to viral proteins
6) protease cuts proteins into functional viruses
7) capsids bud off with host cell envelope
8) virus targets Helper T cells and macrophages

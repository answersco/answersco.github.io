title: "Balloon-occlusion hepatic venography with pressure measurements"
---
Occlusion-balloon catheter technique in combination with hepatic venography is most convenient way to obtain hepatic sinusoidal pressure measurements.

Occlusion balloon catheter positioned in a hepatic vein but not inflated.
-Free hepatic venous pressure (FHVP) measurement: Triphasic waveform should be observed on monitor, and mean pressure recorded (FHVP)
-Wedged HVP measurement: Occlusion balloon inflated (wedged)- hepatic venous waveform flattens and becomes monophasic. WHVP then measured.

Intrahepatic portal pressure expressed as the hepatic vein pressure gradient (HVPG) or &quot;corrected sinusoidal pressure)
HVPG = WHVP - FHVP

Pressure between the HV and RA should also be measured to exclude significant gradient.

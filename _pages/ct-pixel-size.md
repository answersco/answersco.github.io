title: "CT pixel size"

CT pixel size
p = FOV/m
M = matrix size
Pixel size, FOV, and image matrix size in both x and y dimensions are typically the same.
The size of each voxel in the 3rd dimension (along the z-direction) = the slice thickness (S)
Each voxel has x, y, and z side lengths of p, p, and S
Volume of the voxel = p x p x S
Pixel size = DFOV / matrix size
DFOV = display field of view

title: "Implementation"
---
1) prepare a restful environment.
2) promote bedtime rituals.
3) offer appropriate bedtime snacks and beverages.
4) promote relaxation and comfort.
5) respect normal sleep-wake patterns.
6) schedule nursing care to avoid disturbances.
7) use medications to produce sleep.
8) teach about rest and sleep.
9) use of CPAP for sleep apnea.

1) dyspnea management
-anxiety
-too much physical activity
2) airway maintenance
-mobilization of secretions 
-suctioning
-artificial airway
3) maintenance &amp; promotion of lung expansion
-positioning
-incentive spirometry
-chest tubes
-productive cough
-deep breathing
4) CPR
5) hydration: thins secretions

1) health promotion
2) prevention of pressure ulcers
-positioning &amp; skin care
-use of pressure reducing surfaces
3) patient teaching
-hygiene
-protection from sun
-pressure ulcer prevention

-taking the information gathered and synthesized into nursing diagnoses to plan the patient care

--proper drug administration
1) general information:
-dose, frequency, time, OTC medications, etc.
2) self-administration
-route, demonstration and return demonstration
3) diet
-foods to include and foods to avoid
4) side effects
-usual vs. unusual
5) cultural considerations 
-comfort measures
-patient and family education

-comfort measures to relieve pain, fever, etc.
-fever management: antipyretics, tepid baths, cooling blankets, etc.
-ambulation and positioning
-pulmonary activities like coughing and deep breathing and the incentive spirometer
-patient &amp; family education
-isolation
-antibiotics
-asepsis: medical &amp; surgical
-standard precautions/hand hygiene

Health Promotion 
-before immobility happens, you want to encourage mobility
-use it or lose it
1) physical fitness promotion 
-exercise programs
2) osteoporosis prevention 
-bone density screenings 
-calcium &amp; vitamin D
3) injury prevention 
-identify falls risk
-a &quot;risk for falls&quot; is a past patient history of having fallen

-nurse carrying out the plan
-actual initiation of identified interventions and care activities
-types of nursing interventions: direct interventions &amp; indirect interventions
-physician-initiated/collaborative interventions: need doctor's orders before nurse carries them out -- EX. when you are asked by another HCP, like a physical therapist, to do something such as move him or turn him every 2 hours

-Communication is critical
-Everything that the nurse (or others) will do for the
patient
-Some things can be delegated
&#180;Direct care
&#180;Indirect care
&#180;Independent care
&#180;Dependent care
&#180;Interdependent care

the process by which a law or policy is put into operation

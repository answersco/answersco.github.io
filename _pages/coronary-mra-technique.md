title: "Coronary MRA technique"
---
Coronary MRA: challenges due to motion and small vessel size
Imaging performed during mid-diastole: minimal heart motion and rapid coronary blood flow.
3D coronary artery imaging techniques have high spatial resolution&#8594; breath-hold acquisition usually not possible (unlike most other cardiac MRI sequences)
Navigator imaging techniques: can be used to eliminate respiratory motion while still allowing the patient to breathe
Images are only obtained while the diaphragm is in a specified position across multiple breaths
Coronary MRA uses many different sequences, including SE, GRE, SSFP, and gadolinium-enhanced.

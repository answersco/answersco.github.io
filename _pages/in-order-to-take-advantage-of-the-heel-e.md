title: "In order to take advantage of the heel effect in PA CXR, the x-ray tube (anode-cathode) should be oriented how?"
---
With the anode toward the head and the cathode toward the feet.
The heel effect causes a lower intensity toward the anode side of the anode-cathode axis, so the anode should be closer to the upper thorax and the cathode toward the diaphragm to (at least partially) compensate for the differential attenuation of the x-ray beam between these 2 body regions.

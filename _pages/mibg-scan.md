title: "MIBG scan"
---
Metaiodobenzylguanidine with I-123. Peds dose 0.15 mCi/Kg. Adult 10 mCi/1.73m BSA.

Analog of noradrenalin
Taken up by adrenergic tissue 
First line for PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA, PARAGANGLIOMA, and NEUROBLASTOMA
Note this is normal labeled with I-123 or I-131
You MUST first block the thyroid so you dont get unintended dose (this can be LUGOLS solution or perchlorate)
KIDNEYS ARE NOT SEEN (only sympathetic in one spot which is not enough)
CARDIAC CAN BE SEEN (sympathetic organ)
Superior to Tc-MDP for bone scan in neuroblastoma (if you see diffuse bone uptake on MIBG then it is DIFFUSE METS)
Certain meds must be held with MIBG (basically things that effect the sympathetic nervous system - Ca channel blockers, labetolol (on BB that affects), resperine, TCA, other sympathetic analogs)

No bones, +/- heart, NO kidneys, always has a liver

Breast US
averages frames over mult freq or depths (array) to counter speckles (freq overlapping/in-out phase) and artifacts &quot;clutter&quot;

Compound imaging combines multiple frames of images acquired at various frequencies or with the ultrasound beam steered at various angles and then forms the multiple frames into one.

Compound imaging: commonly used in breast imaging
Uses the electronic steering of the US beams to image an object in multiple different locations &#8594; sharpens the edges and decreases posterior shadowing (which could make a cyst look solid)

This is electronic steering of the ultrasound beams which allows an object to imaged in multiple different directions 
This will SHARPEN the edges
This CAN cause a loss of posterior acoustic shadowing (therefore it can make a cystic structure look more solid)

Cleaner edges

Lose posterior shadowing

---
Receptor: DEL (detector element size) 2-3 for FPD, 3-6 for II, 1-2 for tv (limiting)
Motion and frame avg
Dynamic range
Binning decreases it
Pulsed floor could decrease blur

Focal spot: smaller better
Detector Width: smaller better
Nyquist Limitation &quot;Sampling): Oversampling better
Reconstruction filter: BONE algorithm gives higher spatial

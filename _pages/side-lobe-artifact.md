title: "Side lobe artifact"
---
pseudo sludge in the gallbladder is an example of what type of artifact?

BEAM related artifact
Violates the principle that &quot;all echoes originate from the main beam&quot;
If there is a strong reflect that reflects some of the &quot;side lobe&quot; echoes (which are lateral to the main beam), it will then take that signal and place it as if it were originating from the main beam
This is how you get PSEUDOSLUDGE

Artifact that happens when stuff from side lobes gets registered like it came from the main beam. Classic example = &quot;pseudosludge&quot; in the gallbladder or bladder

title: "Photoelectric Interactions"
---
This is where the incoming xray hits an INNER electron and causes ejection with the downstram cascade of characteristic xray production when outershell electrons fill the gap. This typically happens at LOWER ENERGY spectrums.

The other possibility is that an AUGER electron is created which still can cause damage to tissue.

Photoelectric interactions are ALL OR NOTHING, i.e., the energy of the incoming xray has to be GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO the inner shell binding energy.

The probability of a PE interaction is HIGHEST near the inner shell binding energy and DECREASES as you go over that (essentially super high powered electrons just blast through your material) The function is INVERSE to the 3rd power. Probability PE = 1/E^3 . REMEMBER E = incident photon energy 

The HIGHER the Z, the more likely you will have a photoelectric effect, Prob PE = Z^3 (direct relationship). The nice thing about this cubed relationship is it allows for good contrast differention between things that have SIMILAR Z. 

PE interactions DO CONTRIBUTE TO CONTRAST WITHIN AN IMAGE (this is a good thing)

The bad:

1. Photoelectric interactions generate the MOST dose to patient because they are FULLY absorbed (all or nothing). Remember, even with compton scatter, NOT ALL of the energy is absorbed.

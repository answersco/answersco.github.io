title: "What happens in slice-selection and phase-encoding sequences?"
---
Slice-Selection&#8594; gradient turns on, altering the resonant frequency of H1 along the slice-select direction.
RF (radiofrequency) pulse is applied while gradient is on.
H1 nuclei having the proper resonant frequency are excited (i.e., in a &quot;slice&quot;).
H1 magnetic moments in the excited slice precess in phase.

Phase Encoding&#8594; labels nuclei according to position.
Gradient turns on briefly, pointing along the phase-encode direction.
Precession phase in the excited slice is altered along the phase-encode direction.

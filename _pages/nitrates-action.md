title: "Nitrates action"
---
1) act directly on smooth muscle to cause relaxation
2) dilate veins, arteries, &amp; capillaries - wide systemic vasodilation which causes reflex tachycardia
3) increase blood flow
4) lower BP
5) decrease preload &amp; afterload - bc there is widespread vasodilation
6) decrease cardiac workload &amp; O2 demand

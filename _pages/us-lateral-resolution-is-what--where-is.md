title: "US Lateral resolution is what? Where is it the best?"
---
The ability resolve objects in a direction PERPENDICULAR to the beam direction.

- it's best in the FOCAL ZONE
- it's also depth dependent (worsens in the deeper field due to beam divergence)
- increased gain will widen the beam, so want to try to use the minimal necessary gain for best lateral resolution 
- It's generally 4x worse than your axial resolution (per Huda)

Low lying/tethered cord: low conus (below T2), thickened filum terminale (&lt; 2 mm)
Meningomyelocele associated with Chiari malformations, but not lipomyelomeningocele.

Anal atresia: high risk for occult cord problems-need screening
Low-lying/tethered cords are closely lined with spina bifida (tufts of hair)
Low dimples (below gluteal crease): DO NOT need screening
High dimples (above gluteal crease): DO need screening.

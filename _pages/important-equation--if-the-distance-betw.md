title: "IMPORTANT EQUATION: If the distance between object and XR source goes from 3m to 5m, how much does the XR beam intensity at the object drop?"

Inverse square law

Take the square of the ratio of the distances (3/5)^2 = 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36!

(Conceptually it's easy = if doubled distance, you know it'd go down to 1/4th the original, because (1/2^2) or alternatively, (3/6)^2!)

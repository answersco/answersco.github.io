Mazabraud: intramuscular myxomas and fibrous dysplasia

Gorham disease (AKA disappearing bone disease, Gorham massive osteolysis): rare vascular disorder with spontaneous, progressive resorption of bone.
May affect any bone, but most commonly skull, shoulder, and pelvis.
Osteolysis usually involves a singel bone, but may extend to regional bones from a single focus.
Splenic cysts and soft tissuechanges adjacent to the site of skeletal involvement are common.

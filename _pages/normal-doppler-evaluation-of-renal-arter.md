title: "Normal Doppler evaluation of renal arteries"
---
Normal renal artery is a low-resistance vessel with antegrade flow present throughout the cardiac cycle
PSV should be &lt; 180 cm/sec

RI = (PSV - EDV) / PSV
-Measured from arcuate or interlobar arteries, normal values should be &lt; 0.7
-Borderline increased resistance is &gt;/= 0.8
-In children, RI &gt; 0.7 may be normal up to age 4 years.
-Adults, high RI suggests chronic parenchymal disease that will not improve with revascularization.

Intra-atrial thrombi are usually associated with atrial fibrillation, often secondary to rheumatic heart disease. Commonly occurs along posterior wall of LA. Left ventricular thrombi are usually secondary to recent infarction or ventricular aneurysm. Clots typically have low MR GRE signal, whereas tumors have intermediate signal. Clots will not enhance.

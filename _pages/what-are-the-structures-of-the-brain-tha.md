---
-The thalamus is the switching station that sends sensory information to the proper areas of the cortex.

-The hypothalamus controls hunger, thirst, sleep, sexual behavior, sleeping and waking, and emotions. It also controls the pituitary gland.

-The limbic system consists of the thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, and the cingulate cortex.

-The hippocampus is the part of the brain responsible for the formation of long-term declarative memories and remembering locations of objects.

-The amygdala controls our fear responses and memory of fearful stimuli.

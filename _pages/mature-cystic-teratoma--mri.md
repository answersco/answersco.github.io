title: "Mature cystic teratoma (MRI):"
---
Mature cystic teratoma (dermoid cyst): most common benign ovarian neoplasm in young women, composed of differentiated tissue from at least 2 embryonic cell layers
Typically a unilocular cystic structure filled with sebaceous material, hair follicles, and other tissues, less commonly as a heterogeneous mass or solid fat-containing mass.
Rokitansky nodule: solid nodule projecting into the cyst cavity
Imaging: the sebaceous intracystic component is typically hyperintense on T1 and T2WI, matching fat intensity
Both endometrioma and dermoid are predominantly hyperintense on T1
Fat-suppressed sequences are key to differentiation: teratoma will show signal loss on FS images.

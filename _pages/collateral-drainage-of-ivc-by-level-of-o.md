title: "Collateral drainage of IVC by level of occlusion: infrarenal obstruction"
---
Infrarenal obstruction: results in drainage of LEs via ascending lumbar, paraspinal, gonadal, inferior epigastric, and abdominal wall veins.

Retrograde or obstructed flow in internal iliac veins: results in drainage through the gonadal, ureteric, and inferior mesenteric veins.

Occlusion of IVC between renal and hepatic veins: can be drained by all of the collateral routes described for intrarenal obstruction.
-Azygous and hemiazygous veins also assume an important role

Obstruction at suprahepatic IVC (above hepatic vein orifices): results in collateral flow through all of the above-described routes, except the IMV.

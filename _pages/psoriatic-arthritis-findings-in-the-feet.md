Foot&#8594; most commonly affects the great toe IP and MTP joints.
Ivory phalanx: osteosclerosis, relatively specific for psoriatic arthritis.
Produces a plantar calcaneal spur with periosteal reaction (in contrast, a degenerative calcaneal spur is without reactive new bone).

Spine &#8594; causes formation of coarse bony bridging (bulky lateral bony outgrowths), sometimes indistinguishable from reactive arthropathy.

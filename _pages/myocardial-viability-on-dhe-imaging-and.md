title: "Myocardial viability on DHE imaging and revascularization"
---
Regions with abnormal wall motion in coronary distribution at rest without DHE = hibernating myocardium &#8594; most likely to recover function with revascularization
Regions with wall-motion abnormalities and DHE ranging from 1-25% transmural thickness &#8594; likely to regain function after revascularization
Regions with 25-50% transmural DHE are may recover function
Regions with 50-100% transmural DHE are unlikely to recover function

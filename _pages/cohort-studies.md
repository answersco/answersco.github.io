Cohort studies: involves investigators following subjects over time, and can be prospective or retrospective
Prospective variety: investigator defines the sample cohort and measures predictor variables before outcomes have occurred.
Retrospective variety: the investigator identifies a cohort that has been defined in the past and collects data on predictor variables that have been measured in the past.
Advantages:
Yields incidence (defined as the proportion of people who get the disease over a period of time)
Establishes the sequence of events (helpful in inferring causation)
Can study several outcomes
Allows for complete and accurate measurements of variables (though this strength is undermined by incomplete follow-up of subjects).
Retrospective design: generally less expensive to perform
Weaknesses:
Prospective cohort design: expensive and inefficient, especially as diseases being studied become less common.
Retrospective design: the existing data may be inaccurate or incomplete for the investigator's purposes.

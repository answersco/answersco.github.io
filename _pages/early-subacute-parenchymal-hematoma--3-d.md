Early subacute hematoma (3 days to 1 week) &#8594; intracellular methemoglobin
Methemoglobin is paramagnetic&#8594; undergoes proton-electron dipole-dipole interactions (PEDDI) with water&#8594; shortens T1&#8594; T1 hyperintensity.
Intracellular and extracellular methemoglobin are both hyperintense on T1.
Blood remains T2-hypointense in early subacute phase due to the paramagnetic effects of methemoglobin.

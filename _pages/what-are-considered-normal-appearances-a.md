title: "What are considered normal appearances and characteristics of axillary lymph nodes?"
---
1) No absolute size criterion for an abnormal LN
2) Cortical thickness &lt;3 mm
3) Normal vascular flow at the hilum, but should raise concern if seen within the periphery of the cortex
4) Lymphatic fluid flow is from the cortex to the hilum
5) Normal LN frequently demonstrate rapid enhancement with delayed washout on MRI, therefor bx should be pursued based on morphology.

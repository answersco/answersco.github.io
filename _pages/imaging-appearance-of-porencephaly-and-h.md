title: "Imaging appearance of porencephaly and how to distinguish from arachnoid cyst and schizencephaly?"
---
Porencephaly = due to prior ischemia, you get cystic degeneration and encephalomalacia = cyst appears well defined and often corresponds to a vascular territory.
* The cyst is lined by white matter, possibly with GLIOSIS

* Open lip schizencephaly and arachnoid cysts are lined by GRAY MATTER

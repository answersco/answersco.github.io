title: "What is an unroofed coronary sinus?"
---
The atrial wall between the coronary sinus and left atrium is either partially or completely absent, resulting in a left-to-right shunt
- coronary sinus NORMALLY drains into RA, but instead it drains to LA

* Great cardiac vein may also have a separate ostium into the LA
** STRONGLY Associated with persistent L SVC!!
- May see AVSD or anomalies of left atrial appendage

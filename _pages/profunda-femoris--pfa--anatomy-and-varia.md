PFA: originates laterally and posteriorly to SFA
-Provides proximal branches to hip (lateral and medial circumflex femoral) before descending deep in the thigh adjacent to the medial edge of the femur.
-Multiple branches to thigh muscles before terminating above the adductor canal. These branches anastomose with muscular branches of the SFA and popliteal arteries.

Variants present in 40%
-Most commonly independent origins of the medial or lateral circumflex femoral arteries from the CFA.

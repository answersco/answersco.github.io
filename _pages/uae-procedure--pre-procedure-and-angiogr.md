title: "UAE procedure: pre-procedure and angiogram"
---
Pre-procedure serum pregnancy test
Foley in bladder to keep it empty
Antibiotics (usually broad-spectrum cephalosporin) before procedure
Dose limitation: lowest possible pulse mode (often 4 pulses/sec), careful coning, limited use of magnification, short angio runs at 1 frame/sec

-Initial pelvic angiogram with pigtail catheter at level of renal arteries shows pelvic circulation as well as presence of enlarged gonadal arteries, one of the potential causes of clinical failure.
-Hypogastric angio in ipsilateral anterior oblique projection allows identification of uterine artery origin from anterior division branch. The uterine arteries are usually hypertrophied, tortuous, and can be traced to the hypervascular masses in the uterus. 
-Staining of fibroid is common, but AV shunting is not and suggests a different pathology (e.g. AVM or tumor).

title: "2D imaging sequences and advantages over 3D:"
---
2D imaging sequences &#8594; acquires images by exciting a stack of thin (2D) slices
Thin &quot;slice&quot; is excited.
Slice-selection gradient &quot;localizes&quot; tissue along one axis of the imaging volume.
Phase and frequency encoding proceeds in each slice.
Phase and frequency encoding localizes tissue along 2 slice axes.
Advantages&#8594;
Typically faster scan times than 3D
Phase-encoding artifacts only along one axis.

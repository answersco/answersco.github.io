title: "Cross-Talk Artifact (Cross-excitation)"
---
Caused by imperfect shape of RF slice Profiles which leads to unintended excitation of adjacent slice or tissue.
 FIX...
-Increasing Interslice Gap
-Acquire images using an interleaved method (Slices 1,3,5,7,9 then 2,4,6,8,10) etc
-by acquiring an entire stack in its entirety before moving to the next stack, in a multi-stack sequence.

title: "Which usually invades IAC - schwannoma or meningioma? What is their enhancement pattern and calc pattern?"
---
Schwanomma invades! &quot;Trumpet shaped&quot; IAC when porus acousticus is widened.
- Less homogeneous enhancement and less calcs
- T1 iso, T2 bright

Meningioma usually does NOT invade IAC
- More homogeneous enhancement and more likely to calcify
* BROAD BASED DURAL TAIL is specific
- can RESTRICT
* Remember meningioma is most likely over the cerebral convexity and can take up Octreotide and MDP on nukes scan!

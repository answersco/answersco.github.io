title: "Right-sided biliary drainage: access"
---
One-stick needle system commonly used for access.
-When a bile duct (BD) is entered, contrast in inject to opacify biliary system. If patient is septic, the minimum amount of CM is injected.
-If a favorable duct is entered, a 0.018 inch guidewire is placed through needle and manipulated toward the hepatic hilum and CBD.
-For patients with hilar obstruction, it is important to gain entry into a peripheral duct, particularly if a stent will be placed.
-If the wire doesn't run appropriately down the duct toward the hilum, you can turn the bevel of the needle in 90-degree aliquots and then probe with the wire.
-When the 0.018 wire is at the level of the CHD or more distally, the needle is withdrawn and replaced with a 5-Fr sheath assembly.
-Particularly with a vertical BD, the metal stiffening cannula should be removed when the sheath assembly reaches the BD, allowing the more flexible inner 4-Fr plastic cannula and 5-Fr sheath to follow the guidewire down toward the hilum. 
-A 0.035 hydrophilic guidewire or 1.5-mm J guidewire can also be used to manipulate down the duct.

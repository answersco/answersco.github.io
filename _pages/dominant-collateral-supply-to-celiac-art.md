title: "Dominant collateral supply to celiac artery"
---
The pancreaticoduodenal arteries from the SMA are the dominant collateral supply to the celiac artery.

Primary transpancreatic communications from the SMA through the dorsal pancreatic artery, such as the Arc of Buhler, can exist in some patients.

These same circuits can provide collateral supply from the celiac artery to the SMA.

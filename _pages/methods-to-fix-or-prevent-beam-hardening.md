---
Filtration: pre-hardening the beam to remove lower energy components before they hit the patient, and/or using bowtie filter.

Calibration correction: use phantom to allow the detector to compensate for the hardening effect

Correct software&#8594; can use an iterative correction algorithm

Avoidance: can tilt the gantry or position the patient to avoid areas that cause beam hardening

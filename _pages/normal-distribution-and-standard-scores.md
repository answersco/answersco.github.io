Probability distribution: used to describe the behavior of a random variable. 
For discrete variables, a probability distribution specifies all possible outcomes of the variable as well as the probability that each will occur.
For continuous variables, it specifies the probabilities associated with a specific range of values.

2 most commonly used probability distributions in radiology are binomial and normal distributions.
Binomial distribution: describes the chance of an event occurring when each trial (e.g. coin flip) is independent, outcomes are mutually exclusive, and probability of success (e.g. heads) is the same for each trial.

Normal distribution: describes the probabilities for a continuous outcome that is the result of averaging a large # of independent, random observations. Can be described as bell-shaped, and depends on the mean and SD.
~95.4% of the area under the standard normal curve lies within +/- 2 SD from the mean.

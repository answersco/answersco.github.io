title: "Indications for IR treatment in mesenteric vein thrombosis"
---
3/4 without peritoneal signs respond at least partially to anticoagulation.

Indications for IR management: ongoing pain, bowel wall thickening, or other signs suggestive of progressive venous congestion.

Interventions:
Catheter-directed thrombolysis using direct transhepatic access.
For severe cases, addition of indirect infusions through the SMA may promote clearing of thrombus in peripheral mesenteric veins.

Chronic occlusion of SMV may result in formation of mesenteric varices and intestinal bleeding.
-Short-segment stenoses and occlusions may be amenable to stent placement, usually from transjugular approach.

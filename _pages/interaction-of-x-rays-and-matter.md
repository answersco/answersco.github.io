title: "Interaction of x-rays and matter"
---
1) Photoelectric effect = all energy transferred to atom with characteristic x-ray emitted.
2) Compton Scatter = only some energy transferred, and photon continues through matter and will likely interact again.
3) Coherent scatter = photon absorbed and re-emitted in different direction
4) Auger e- = no photon, only e- ejected

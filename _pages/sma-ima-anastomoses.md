Marginal artery of Drummond: major SMA-IMA anastomosis
Lies in peripheral mesentery of the colon, adjacent to the mesenteric surface of the colon.
Comprised of branches from the ileocolic, right colic, middle colic, and left colic arteries.
Normally the marginal artery of Drummond is small, but may be larger in setting of IMA or SMA disease.
Arc of Riolan: inconstant SMA-IMA anastomosis
Also runs through the colonic mesentery, but more medial than the marginal artery of Drummond.
Cannon-Bohm point: the point of transitional blood supply to the colon between the SMA (proximal) and the IMA (distal) at the splenic flexure.
This watershed zone is susceptible to ischemia in case of systemic arterial insufficiency.

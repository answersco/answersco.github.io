title: "Atrial septal defect"
---
Atrial septal defect (ASD) &#8594; most isolated, but may be associated with other syndromes such as Hold-Oram syndrome (ASD and upper extremity bone deformities)
Ostium secundum &gt; ostium primum &gt; sinus venosus (associated with anomalous pulmonary venous drainage).
Causes right heart volume overload, with normal left atrium unless mitral regurgitation is present.
Initially the RA enlarges, followed by the RV (may be seen on lateral XR as filling of retrosternal clear space). 
In late-stage disease the PA becomes enlarged.
Shunt vascularity is usually present by the time the lesion becomes symptomatic.

title: "What is ionization chamber/dose calibrator consistency? How often to check?"
---
Want it to show up within 5% of computed activity (Daily - CLAG)

Accurate readout for activities over the whole range of potentially encountered activities (Quarterly - CLAG)

Standard measurements of radio tracers measured compared to what activity should be (Annually and at installation - CLAG)

Correction for different positioning and size (different volumes of liquids of the sample)
(Performed at installation, repair, and when you move it) - CLAG

Roman Catholic bishops and cardinals who met in the 1540s-1550s to reaffirmed traditional Catholic teachings, forbade the sale of indulgences, promoted both good words and faith as the path to salvation, said that the Bible and the RCChurch proclamations were equally valid, and any individual who substituted his/her own interpretation over that of the Church was a heretic subject to punishment (even death)

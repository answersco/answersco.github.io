title: "What arises from the right main coronary artery?"
---
Right main --&gt; a) acute marginal branch (AM), b) AV node branch and c) Posterior descending artery (PDA).

In 50-60% the 1st branch of the RCA is the small conus branch, that supplies the RVOT.

In 20-30% the conus branch arises directly from the Ao.

In 60% a sinus node artery arises as second branch of the RCA, that runs posteriorly to the SA-node (in 40% it originates from the Cx).

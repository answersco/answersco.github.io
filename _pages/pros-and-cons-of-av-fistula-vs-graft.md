title: "Pros and cons of AV fistula vs graft"
---
AV fistula:
-Pros: Lasts longer, more durable
-Much less prone to developing venous neointimal hyperplasia at or downstream from the graft-vein anastomosis.
-Cons: needs 3-4 months to mature (vein to enlarge enough for HD)

AV graft:
-Pros: ready for use in 2 weeks
-Easier to declot (clot usually confined to the synthetic graft.
-Cons: less overall longevity
-Promotes hyperplasia of venous intima at or downstream from the graft-vein anastomosis, resulting in stenosis and eventual obstruction.
-Higher infection rate.

title: "Techniques to reduce dose to peds patients and breast"
---
Peds: recommended to reduce mAs
Reduced techniques possible due to greater x-ray penetration
Dose reduction in head CT more modest than in abdomen

Breast: 
Reduced mA &#8594; images look noisy
mA modulation (preferred) &#8594; adjust technique based on density
Bismuth shield&#8594; artifact and degraded image
Beam hardening may falsely elevate HU directly deep to shield

Peds: recommended to reduce mAs
Reduced techniques possible due to greater x-ray penetration

Dose reduction in head CT more modest than in abdomen

title: "Crude Mortality Rate"
---
-an annual rate that represents the proportion of a population who die from any cause during the one year period, using the midyear population as the denominator
-represents the actual death rate for the total population, BUT does not reveal specific causes of death
-rate is affected by the population's age distributions (older people are greater risk of death then their younger counterparts)

EX. 
Number of Reported Deaths During 1 Year x 100,000/Estimated Population as of July 1 of Same Year

2,403,351 (deaths) = 0.008731 X 100,000 = 873.1 per 100,000
275,264,999 (population of people)

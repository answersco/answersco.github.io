title: "Catheter positioning for imaging brachial artery and forearm arteries; angio of hand"
---
Brachial artery: should be imaged with catheter in proximal axillary artery to avoid spasm and to include possible high origin of radial or ulnar artery.

Selective angio of individual forearm arteries: best performed with small, high-flow microcatheters due to common spasm.

Hand: because digital arteries are small and numerous, mag views and vasodilation (such as NG) are frequently necessary.

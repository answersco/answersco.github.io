title: "Dielectric effects  Mechanism: Appearance: Better: Worse:"
---
Mechanism: Standing waves created as radiowave approaches length of body part
Appearance: large decrease in signal in the center of the FOV; large patients; ascites
Better: Use multi channel transmit, lower field strength (1.5 T); apply dielectric pads
Worse: Higher field strength (3 T)

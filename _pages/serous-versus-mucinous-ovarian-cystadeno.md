Serous: unilocular (fewer septations)
Papillary projections common (suggest malignancy)
Commonly bilateral (especially when malignant)

Mucinous: typically multiloculated (septa are thin)
Papillary projections less common
Can see low level echoes (mucin)
Can get pseudomyxoma peritonei with scalloping along solid organs
Smoking is a risk factor

title: "Graphical tools in quality and safety: diagram used in Root Cause Analysis"
---
Fishbone diagram (AKA Ishikawa Diagram, or Cause-and-Effect diagrams): used in Root Cause Analysis to identify all contributing causes to an identified problem.
Used to categorize and organize ideas about contributing factors and their relationships within a process in the following ways:
1. Define and understand the causes of an outcome
2. Graphically display the relationship of causes to the outcome.
3. Help to identify improvement opportunities. Depicted by drawing a central horizontal line with a box at the end, with 4-6 lines from the horizontal line indicating classes of contributors (sources) to the central issue (e.g. people, equipment).
4. Generate a list of factors or situations that &quot;cause&quot; a problem and assign them to one of the identified sources.
5. Look for multiple causes within a single source.
6. Continue to analyze the situation until the causes of the problem are specific enough to identify a potential change.

Labral tear may lead to a para-labral cyst
-A cyst in the supraglenoid notch may compress the suprascapular nerve: can cause denervation of the supraspinatus and/or infraspinatus.
-A cyst in the quadrilataral space can compress the axillary nerve: can cause denervation of the deltoid and teres minor.

Denervation: causes edema that can be see as increased muscular T2 signal as soon as a week after the event.
-Severe prolonged degeneration can result in fatty atrophy of the muscle with increased T1 signal.

Detector alignment&#8594; checks that the detector heads are level and square in different orientations &#8594; important in SPECT
Multiwindow spatial alignment &#8594; ensures that the coordinates for different energy windows coincide with each other
&lt; + 2 mm of variation of position for any of the energy windows is acceptable.
Dead-Time Test
Calculation of the count-rate associated with 20% dead time
Acceptable count rate of 20% dead time will vary with the application and scanner geometry.
Rotational Uniformity &#8594; more critical for SPECT than for planar gamma camera imaging &#8594; ensures that the results don't depend on camera orientation
Things that may affect this include interference from other sources such as other cameras or due to magnetic effects.

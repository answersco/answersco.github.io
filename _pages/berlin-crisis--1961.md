title: "Berlin Crisis, 1961"
---
W Berlin is prosperous. E. Berlin is a wreck. East Germans leave for West Berlin (3mil since 1949). Embarrassment to Khrushchev - communism failing! USSR and E Germany threaten to close access to W Berlin. JFK refuses to give up access, USSR backs down due to superior US nuclear force. Instead, Berlin Wall is erected.

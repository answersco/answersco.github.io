title: "Enzymes"
---
-effects rate of catalysis bc increase in temperature equals an increase rate of catalysis (2x per 10 degrees C)
-high temps will eventually degrade proteins

-contact cleaner --- these break down oil and dirt
-lactaid --- these help breaks down lactose

-proteins that make the biochemical reaction faster w/o changing their conformation
EX. glycolysis, TCA cycle, and O/P are operated by a series of up to 100 enzymes

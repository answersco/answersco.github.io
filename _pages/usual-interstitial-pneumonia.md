title: "Usual Interstitial Pneumonia"
---
Pattern of lung injury with honeycombing &amp; fibrosis; IPF, Collagen vascular, drugs, exposure, RA

Most common of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. Most cases are sporadic. 30% of cases associated with collagen vascular or immunologic disorder. Findings: Irregular septal or subpleural thickening. Intralobular lines. Honeycombing. Traction bronchiectasis. Typically most severe in peripheral and basal lungs.

MOST COMMON interstitial lung disease
When there is NO KNOWN CAUSE, this is called IDEOPATHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS

Buzzwords:
- Traction bronchiectasis
- Honey combing
- Apical to basal gradient (findings WORSE in the lung bases)

On pathology, they are normally going to call this HETEROGENOUS

MC
idiopathic = IPF
reduced lung volumes from fibrosis
reticular pattern in the posterior costophrenic angle

LL and along the periphery mild GGO

apical to basal gradient
traction brochiectasis and HONEYCOMBING
Histology: Heterogenous

&lt; 3 years survival

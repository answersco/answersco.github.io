Pre-test probability of disease: the prevalence of the disease in the test population

Post-test probability of disease: the probability (prob) of an outcome is defined as the # of times the outcome is observed divided by the total # of observations
The odds of an outcome are defined as the probability that the outcome does occur divided by the probability that it doesn't occur
Odds = prob / (1-prob)
Prob = odds / (1 + odds)
The post-test probability of disease is determined by both the prevalence (pre-test probability) and the test information (likelihood ratio)
Post-test odds: defined as the pre-test odds x likelihood ratio (LR)
LR: the probability of getting a specific result if the patient has the disease divided by the probability of that result if the patient is healthy
Positive likelihood ratio (LRp) = sensitivity / (1-specificity)
Negative likelihood ratio (LRn) = (1 - sensitivity) / specificity
LRp &gt; 10 and LRn &lt; 0.1 provide convincing diagnostic evidence
LRp &gt; 5 and LRn &lt; 0.2 provide strong diagnostic evidence

title: "What is the anterior vs posterior nose supply? Which requires neuro IR for bad epistaxis?"
---
Anterior = Kisselbach's plexus (easy to compress)
- Anterior ethmoidal artery (ophthalmic artery)
Posterior ethmoidal artery (ophthalmic artery)
Greater palatine artery (maxillary artery)
Septal branch of the superior labial artery (from the facial artery)

Posterior = SPHENOPALATINE ARTERY (terminal branch of internal maxillary artery) is the target for Neuro IR

* Beware variant connection between ECA and ophthalmic artery (don't embo the eye!)

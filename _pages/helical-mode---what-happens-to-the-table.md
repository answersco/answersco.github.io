title: "Helical mode:  What happens to the table and tube?  Which is faster helical or axial  Where are the partial volume effects most significant?"
---
Helical: table moves at constant speed, with tube on continuously.

Much faster than axial CT

Post-acquisition flexibility in the selection of slice location and lower probability of anatomic discontinuities between adjacent slices containing moving anatomy in chest/abdomen.

Artifacts of partial volume with helical CT are more pronounced along a curved surface (e.g. skull)

title: "COPD"
---
-A preventable and treatable disease

-Characterized by airflow limitation (due to collapse of alveoli, constriction of airways, inflammation) that is not fully reversible

-Airflow limitation on exhalation

-Airflow limitation is both progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases

-Once damage is done it cannot be reversed but it can be slowed down

-Variable combinations of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma
(3rd leading cause of death in US)

-if pt has COPD, these chemoreceptor that sense CO2 are ruined b/c of heavy smoking and accumulation of CO2 in the lungs that occurs because of the loss of alveoli elasticity 
-when CO2 accumulates in the lungs it causes less oxygen to be transferred to the alveolis
-pt with COPD get used to this low level of oxygen meaning their brains needs low amounts of oxygen to stimulate to breathe so if given a lot of oxygen, they could hypoventilate

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

-long-term obstruction of airflow and substantial reduction in pulmonary ventilation
-major ones are chronic bronchitis and emphysema
-almost always associated with smoking
-other risk factors include: air pollution, occupational exposure to airborne irritants, hereditary defects

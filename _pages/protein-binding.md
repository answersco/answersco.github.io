title: "Protein binding"
---
-most drugs are bound to some extent to proteins in the blood to be carried into circulation
-drugs that are protein bound have a longer duration of action
-drugs compete for protein binding sites and can &quot;knock&quot; other drugs off protein to increase the free drug
-mostly bind to albumin - checking these levels will help us know how much is circulating on proteins
-acts as a &quot;drug reservoir&quot;
-when a drug is bound to protein it is inactive
-when a drug is unbound it is an active drug
-only unbound drugs are able to move through capillaries

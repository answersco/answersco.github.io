title: "2 most common primary central airway tumors in adults:"
---
Squamous cell carcinoma &#8594; most common primary tracheal malignancy
Strongly associated with smoking
Typical CT appearance: polypoid intraluminal mass, with irregular, smooth, or lobulated contours.
May cause tracheoesophageal fistula due to invasion of the esophagus.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) &#8594; relatively low-grade malignancy, usually in forties
Not associated with smoking.
Propensity for perineural and submucosal spread.
Despite indolent growth, metastatic disease tends to have intense FDG uptake
Typical CT appearance: submucosal mass that infiltrates the tracheal wall and surrounding mediastinal fat.
May also present as circumferential tracheal or bronchial thickening, leading to airway stenosis.

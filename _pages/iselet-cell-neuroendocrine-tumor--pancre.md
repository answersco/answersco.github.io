You can split these up into functional vs non-function with funcational being insulinoma and gastrinoma

Insulinoma: almost always bening, most common, typically small and solitary &lt; 2cm

Gastrinoma: Second most common. Remember zollinger-ellison syndrome (this is JEJUNAL ulcers)

NON-functional: These are usually MALIGNANT and are usually large and have mets at time of dx. THINK shit tons of calcifications

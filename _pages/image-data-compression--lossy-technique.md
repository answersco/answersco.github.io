title: "Image data compression: lossy technique"
---
Lossy compression: reduces bits by identifying marginally important information and removing it.
Irreversible.
Allows for much greater compression: 10:1 or higher
This is the technique most imaging compression methods use, including JPEG.
Most studies have shown that it can be applied up to a limit without affecting the diagnostic content of the images

Medical images that have been subjected to lossy compression must be labeled per the FDA, including the approximate compression ratio used.

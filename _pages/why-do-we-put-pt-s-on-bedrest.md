title: "Why do we put pt's on bedrest?"
---
-if a pt has CHF then while their resting your reducing the O2 needs of the cells
-when we have pt's on prolonged bedrest, one of the signs and symptoms you see are increased heart rate bc heart has to work harder if you are not mobile bc mobility and muscle contractions helps increase peripheral vascular return
-deoxygenated blood to go back to blood to get reoxygenated have to work harder to pump blood bc the pt's body itself is not helping with circulation

title: "Attenuation in US: what affects it, and how is it described?"
---
Attenuation = 0.5 dB/cm/Hz for soft-tissue

Proportional to frequency:
2-MHz US beam will have 2X the attenuation of a 1-MHz beam
A 10-MHz beam will have 10X the attenuation per unit distance
Attenuation is logarithmic: beam intensity is exponentially attenuated with distance

Half-value thickness (HVT): the thickness of tissue necessary to attenuate the incident intensity by 50% (which is equal to a 3-dB reduction in intensity).
As frequency increases, the HVT decreases

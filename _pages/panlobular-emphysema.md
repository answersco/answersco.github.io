title: "Panlobular emphysema"
---
Distention of airspaces throughout lobule. Destruction of central respiratory bronchioles and peripheral alveolar sacs and alveoli. Predilection of lower lobes. Associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

This is going to look like diffuse destruction
Essentially you cannot make out specific areas of destruction 

If you see panlobular emphysema in a lower lung distribution think of the following entities:
- alpha 1 antitrypsin
- Swyer James 
- Ritalin lung

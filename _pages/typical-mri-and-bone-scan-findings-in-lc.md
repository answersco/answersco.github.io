title: "Typical MRI and bone scan findings in LCP:"
---
T1WI: Patchy or linear hypointensity replacing fatty marrow signal (early stage)
T2WI FS: Patchy femoral head increased signal (edema) or decreased signal (sclerosis) (early or late stages)
Hyperintense joint effusion, synovitis
DWI: Restricted diffusion immediately followed by increasing ADC values (increased diffusivity)
T1WI C+ FS: Acute ischemia shows decreased enhancement
Enhancing adjacent marrow edema
Enhancing, thickened synovium
Femoral head normal signal returns in ~ 6 years

Bone scintigraphy
Early: Photopenia of ischemia
Late: Increased uptake with revascularization

title: "DQE in CR/DR"
---
Detector quantum efficiency (DQE): efficiency of detector in converting x-ray energy into an image signal &#8594; ideal is 1.0
The better the DQE, the less radiation you need to maintain your signal
Like MTF, DQE is better at low spatial resolution
DQE of DR is ~0.45, versus lower DQE for CR or XR at 0.25

Factors that affect DQE:
Radiation exposure
Spatial frequency (resolution)
MTF
Detector material
kVp
mAs

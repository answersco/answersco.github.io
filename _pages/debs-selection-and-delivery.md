title: "DEBs selection and delivery"
---
Selection of DEB size and quantity depends on vascularity of the tumor and desired level of occlusion.
-Single vial treatments and lower doses of doxorubicin can be used for more focal, less vascular lesions.
-DEBs are mixed with aqueous contrast, which allows controlled delivery similar to TACE, although focal accumulation of contrast in the tumor, as with iodized oil, does not occur.

Delivery of DEBs follows same principles as TACE
-Lobar or selective tx preferred to whole liver embo
-Beads are delivered until the entire dose has been delivered or flow becomes sluggish.
-Slow delivery of dilute concentrations of beads, and smaller sizes such as 100-300 micron diameter, are thought to improve penetration into the tumor and avoid premature termination of procedure due to early stasis from clumping in larger vessels.

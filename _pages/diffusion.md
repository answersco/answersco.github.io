title: "Diffusion"
---
Borrowing between cultures either directly or through intermediaries

The spread of ideas, objects, or traits from one culture to another

-movement of a solute from area of higher solute concentration to area of lower solute concentration until equally distributed
-O2 &amp; CO2 exchange in pulmonary capillaries and alveoli
-wants to reach an isotonic solution

-process by which molecules move from area of greater concentration to lower concentration 
-O2 and CO2 move between the alveoli and blood by diffusion
-As O2 crosses from the alveoli into the blood, it is carried to the tissues primarily on the hemoglobin molecule that is attached to the RBCs

O2 &amp; CO2 movement between alveoli &amp; blood

-movement of oxygen and carbon dioxide between alveoli and the red blood cells
-assessed by oxygen saturation

-pressure gradients are like concentration gradients
-gases will move high to low
-oxygen follows ITS OWN, separate from carbon dioxide

-passive process- no energy involved
-substances move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration
-down a concentration gradient
-small, nonpolar molecules (O2, CO2) can diffuse freely through a plasma membrane

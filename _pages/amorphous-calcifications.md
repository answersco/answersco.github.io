title: "Amorphous calcifications?"
---
Too small or hazy to acertain the detailed morphologic appearance.

These look like powdered sugar and it's hard to count each individual calcification 
Distribution is key
- if calcs are scattered and bilateral they are probably benign 
- If calcs are segmental then they are probably concerning 

Ddx:
- Fibrocystic change
- sclerosing adenosis
- Columnar cell damage
- DCIS

Lhermitte-Duclos disease (dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum, LDD) is a rare, slowly growing tumor of the cerebellum, sometimes considered as hamartoma, characterized by diffuse hypertrophy of the stratum granulosum of the cerebellum. It is often associated with Cowden syndrome and is pathognomonic for this disease.

title: "Differential absorption"
---
This is the difference between what is absorbed by the body (PE effects) versus what passes right through the body.
Word &quot;differential&quot; refers to the fact that different organ substances absorb differently 

IMPORTANT:
1. Anything that increases photoelectric effects is going to INCREASE absorption. Be examples are density (this is how close the ATOMS are to each other), kVp, K-edge, increasing the Z (atomic number)

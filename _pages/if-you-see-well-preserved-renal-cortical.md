title: "If you see well-preserved renal cortical uptake after captopril (with a normal renogram without captopril), is it compensated or uncompensated RAS?"

Compensated RAS

It's NORMAL without captopril because the Angiotensin II builds up and causes efferent glomerular arteriole constriction, in order to maintain GFR and the normal renogram.

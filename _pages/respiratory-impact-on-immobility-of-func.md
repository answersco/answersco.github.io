title: "Respiratory impact on immobility of function"
---
1) decreased lung expansion: when you are laying flat, there are no deep breaths so less O2 and CO2 exchange in the capillary system 
2) retained secretions: the cilia that help keep respiratory clean are less effective when no deep breaths are being triggered so secretions are being stagnated and collected in the lungs making it harder to clear leading to respiratory infections
3) pulmonary embolus: clots create lack of O2 and CO2 exchange, can be fatal

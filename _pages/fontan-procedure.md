title: "Fontan procedure"
---
Used for hypoplastic hearts
Old-school Fontan: consisted of classic Glenn (SVC to RPA), closure of ASD, and placement of shunt between the RA and LPA.
Allows blood return from systemic circulation to lungs by passive flow (no pump) and turns the single right ventricle into a functional LV.
Complications include right atriomegaly with arrhythmias and plastic bronchitis.

Conduit from RA to pulmonary artery, resulting in all venous return entering the PA directly- bypassing the RV.
Part of a staged surgical correction of single ventricle syndromes, including tricuspid atresia and hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

Once of the staged procedures in the process of fixing hypoplastic left heart
There is going to be a shunt from the RIGHT ATRIUM to the pulmonary artery - this is so the blood bypasses the right ventricle and decreases the amount of work
See image where there is a conduit from the right atrium to the pulmonary arteries

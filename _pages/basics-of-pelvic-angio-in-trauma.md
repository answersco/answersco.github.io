title: "Basics of pelvic angio in trauma"
---
Extended filming often necessary to visualize pelvic arterial extravasation.
Super selective catheterization should be used only in stable patients to avoid unnecessarily prolonging the procedure. 
Primary goal of embo in pelvic fractures: quickly decrease pressure in injured arteries to a level that will allow natural hemostasis. 
 
Careful completion angio is important to exclude bleeding from a collateral source. 
Midline bleeding can be supplied from either IIA
Lateral bleeding may be supplied from lumbar, iliac circumflex, or profunda femoris artery branches as well as the IIA.

If patient remains unstable after technically successful embo, bleeding may be from either venous sources or another arterial source such as liver or splenic laceration.

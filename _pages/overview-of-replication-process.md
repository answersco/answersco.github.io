title: "Overview of replication process"
---
1) Parental DNA strands unwind at replication forks.
2) Each parental strand is a template that attracts and binds complementary bases: A with T, C with G.
-- Each new strand is formed by pairing complementary bases with the old strand 
-- Two molecules are made. 
-- Each molecule has one new and one old (conserved) DNA strand
4) Nucleotides are joined in their sugar-phosphate backbones as covalent bonds.

title: "What is the predominant factor in determining T1 contrast?"
---
TR- affects contrast between tissues that differ in T1 values
Long TR- permits magnetization in all tissues to fully recover- generate no T1-weighting.
Short TR- only tissues with short T1 values fully recover their longitudinal magnetization and contribute a signal.
Short TR times are less than ~300 ms at 1.5T and ~450 ms at 3T.

TE
Short TE values will result in little loss of transverse magnetization (i.e. little T2 decay)- thus produce no differences (contrast) between tissues that have different T2 values.
Short TE values- minimal T2-weighting
Long TE values- will reduce the intensity of transverse magnetization for tissues with short T2 much more than for tissues with long T2. 
Long TE values are typically &gt; 60 ms

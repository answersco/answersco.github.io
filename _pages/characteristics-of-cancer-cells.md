title: "Characteristics of cancer cells"
---
1) lack differentiation and do not contribute to body functioning
2) have abnormal nuclei that are enlarged and may have an abnormal number of chromosomes 
3) unlimited ability to divide
-one way is through turning on the telomerase gene that allows telomeres on chromosomes to continually be built, thus allowing a cell to divide over and over again.
4) form tumors
5) can divide without growth 
6) become abnormal gradually through a multistage process
7) undergo angiogenesis and metastasis

1) looks different from a normal cell
-cell surface has different types and/or number of antigens
2) contain heritable mutations
3) transplantable: taking cancer cells from one organism to another, the second organism will then have cancer
4) dedifferentiated: less specialized than normal cell types, only purpose to is make more cells that have no function
5) unusual cell growth
6) lack contact inhibition - will continue to grow and pile up on each other
7) invasive: squeeze into any space available
8) metastasize&amp; induce angiogenesis
9) secrete hormones that encourage their own growth
10) aneuploid- missing or have extra chromosomes

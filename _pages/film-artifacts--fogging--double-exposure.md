title: "Film artifacts: fogging, double exposure, quantum mottle, incomplete erasure, ghosting"
---
Fogging: adding charge to the detector (blackening the film)
Can occur if cassette left in the room with scattered x-rays
Big black blob on film

Double exposure: cassette used twice without changing film or erasing the receptor
Looks like it has 2 images on it

Quantum mottle: noise from lack of photons&#8594; looks underexposed

Incomplete erasure&#8594; looks like double exposure

Ghosting: result of prior exposure, leading to difference in x-ray sensitivity of different parts of the detector
Looks like a dark object that doesn't belong on the image
Occurs in DR more than in CR

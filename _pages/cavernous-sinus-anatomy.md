title: "Cavernous sinus anatomy"

Important structures are:

CN 3, 4, 6 (basically everything that needs to go through the superior orbital fissure to the eye)
CN V1, V2 

CN 6 = abducens
CN 4 = Trochlear nerve 

CN 2 and V1 DO NOT go through the cavernous sinus 

Remember the first thing to happen in a lot of cavernous sinus pathology is a LATERAL RECTUS palsy due to its inferior location by the carotid.

title: "Amyloid restrictive cardiomyopathy"
---
MRI findings:
- Diffuse decrease in T1 and T2 signal within the myocardium
- You can see LATE GAD enhancement throughout the ENTIRE myocardium
- Need a LONG TI (350ms) - So long that the blood pool may be darker than the myocardium
- Buzzword = difficult to supress mycocardium

**Restrictive = myocardium process

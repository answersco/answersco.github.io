Varicocele: dilation of the pampiniform venous plexus
Primary varicocele (most common): due to absent or incompetent valves in the proximal gonadal vein, causing venous reflux &#8594; highly prevalent and treatable cause of infertility
Secondary varicocele: due to a mass obstructing venous return
Vast majority of varicoceles are left-sided, as the left gonadal vein drains into the left renal vein, while the right gonadal vein drains directly into the IVC
A solitary right varicocele should prompt workup for an obstructing retroperitoneal mass.
Scrotal US: dilated (&gt; 2mm) venous plexus with bag of worms appearance that worsens with Valsalva.
Treatment: coil embolization or surgical ligation of the gonadal vein&#8594; outcomes are equivalent.

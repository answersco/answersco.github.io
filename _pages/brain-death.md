title: "Brain death:"
---
Radiotracer unable to enter cranial cavity due to increased ICP.
Planar imaging typically performed with either Tc-99m pertechnetate or Tc-99m DTPA. SPECT may also be performed, either with HMPAO or ECD-labelled Tc-99m.
Imaging shows no tracer perfusing the brain.
Hot-nose sign: represents increased collateral flow seen in brain death, but is not specific and may be seen in other abnormalities of cerebral perfusion.

tc-ecd or hmpao. brain binding agents. don't NEED first pass perfusion/flow. dtpa needs flow with no binding, so used less.

-Quick review of brain radiotracers:
1. Tc99 DTPA = complete flow agent (it does not cross the BBB)
2. Tc99 HMPAO &amp; Tc99 ECD = lipophilic agents that cross the BBB

Typically, the lipophilic agents are used. POSITIVE study is defined as NO brain uptake on 20 minute delayed images

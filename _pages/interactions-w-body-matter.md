Coherent/rahleigh- minor. Electron doesnt deposit or add dose but degrades image. 
Photoelectric- e ejected and xray totally absorbed. Outer e drops down and emits auger e or characteristic xray. Contributes to contrast or image- best interaction- increases w z- (z3/e3)

Compton- contributes to degrade image.

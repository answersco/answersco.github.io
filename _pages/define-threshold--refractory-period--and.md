title: "Define threshold, refractory period, and all-or-none law."
---
-Threshold: minimum amount of stimulation necessary to open channels and triggers the neural impulse
-Refractory Period: cannot fire agin b/c it is too busy getting reset (mouse trap after catching mouse)
-All-or-None Law: If threshold is reached, a full action potential occurs. If threshold is not attained, there is no action potential occurring

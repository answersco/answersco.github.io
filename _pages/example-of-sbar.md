title: "Example of SBAR"

S (Situation): Hello Tammy (Registered Nurse) this is Helen Adams the home health aide. I am at Mrs. Elmer's house and she is experiencing more shortness of breath when walking today.

B: (Background) When I walked Mrs. Elmer to the bathroom for her bath, she had SOB which she didn't have two days ago. Mrs. Elmer also verbalized that she weighs 2 lbs more than yesterday. 

A(Assessment): I noticed Mrs. Elmer's ankles are swollen. If I press on the swollen area and remove my finger, you can see the indentation. Knowing Mrs. Elmer has Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), I think she may be having issues with her CHF

R (Recommendation): I think that you need to see Mrs. Elmer today.

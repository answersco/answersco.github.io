title: "Schizencephaly"
---
Transmantle gray matter lining clefts
Look for dimple in wall of ventricle if cleft is narrow/closed
Up to 1/2 of schizencephalies are bilateral
When bilateral, 60% are &quot;open-lipped&quot; on both sides
Gray matter lining clefts may appear hyperdense
Ca++ when associated with CMV
Prior to myelination T2WI more clearly defines lesion

Schizencephaly &#8594; full-thickness cleft of cerebral hemisphere lined by dysplastic gray matter (usually from polymicrogyria), forming an abnormal communication between the ventricles and the extra-axial subarachnoid space.
Associated with cortical malformations (gray matter heterotopia) in 30%
Also associated with septo-optic dysplasia&#8594; agenesis of septum pellucidum and optic nerve hypoplasia.
Open-lip: walls of cleft entirely divided by CSF
Closed-lip: walls of cleft are apposed or incompletely divided.
Characteristic finding is a CSF-filled cortical cleft lined by gray matter, with frontal involvement seen most commonly.
Other entities can cause an interruption or cleft in cortex, but only schizencephalic cleft is lined by gray matter:
Porencephaly: replacement of cortex by a cystic structure.
Encephalomalacia.
Surgical resection cavity.

Abnormal neuronal migration resulting in gray matter-lined clefts that invaginate brain. Extend from ventricular ependymal surface to pial cortical surface. Polymicrogyric clefts do not extend to ventricle. Open lip or closed lip (apposed walls) forms.

Schizencephaly is a cleft that is lined with gray matter and extends from the ventricular ependyma to the pial surface of the cortex. The cleft spans the full thickness of the affected hemisphere. The &quot;lips&quot; of the cleft can be fused or closely apposed with closed-lip schizencephaly (as in this case) or appear widely separated in open-lip schizencephaly. Porencephalic cyst is a CSF-filled parenchymal cavity which usually communicates with ventricle and/or subarachnoid space. It is lined by reactive gliosis and not gray matter. Lissencephaly and cortical dysplasia are disorders of cortical formation and do not show a CSF cleft .

Clefts in the cerebral hemispheres in the region of the primary fissures.
Cleft is lined by gray matter
Comes in two forms - closed lip (20%) open lip (80%)

Open lip = you can see CSF through the defect 

Associations:
- Optic nerve hypoplasia
- Absent septum pellucedum
- Epilepsy

title: "Halation?"

The spread of light beyond the proper boundaries. Occurs with screen film systems where the phosphor screen is in front of the film and produces a large halo of photons which interact with the film. With the film in front of the phosphor screen, a smaller halation effect is seen. This improves resolution.

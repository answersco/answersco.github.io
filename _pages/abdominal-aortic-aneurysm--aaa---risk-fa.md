title: "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA): risk factors, screening, and follow-up"
---
Risk factors: age, male sex, smoking, family history
Defined as diameter &gt; 3 cm
Similar to TAA, double-oblique reformatted images should be used to obtain a true cross-sectional diameter.
Annual risk:
AAA between 5.5 and 5.9 cm: 9.4%
AAA between 6.0 and 6.5 cm: 10.2%
AAA between 6.5 and 6.9 cm: 19.2%
AAA &gt; 7 cm: 32.5%

Screening: US screening of high-risk patients approved by Medicare for patients &gt; 65.
Management:
Aneurysm &lt; 4 cm: follow-up in 6 months; if no change&#8594; annual surveillance.
Aneurysm 4-4.5 cm: follow-up in 6 months; if no change &#8594; 6 month surveillance.
Aneurysm 5-5.5 cm: consider surgery
Aneurysm &gt; 5.5 cm: surgery recommended
In addition to size &gt; 5.5 cm, repair is recommended when AAA expands at a rapid rate (&gt;5 mm/year) or is symptomatic.

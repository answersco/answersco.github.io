title: "Decreased patient dose in mammo can be achieved how? (in terms of targets, filters, kV, and compression)?"
---
Increase kV (more penetrating beam so less absorbed)

Switch from Mo to Tungsten target or Mo to Ro filter (produces higher energy XR beam)

More compression (makes breast thinner so easier to penetrate)

(When you have less kV, you have less penetrating beam so the photo timer will increase exposure to maintain adequate photons at the receptor, thus increasing dose)

title: "Checking GRV (gastric residual volume)"
---
1) aspirate gastric content via the tube
-measure the amount aspirated
2) return aspirated contents to the stomach: if not, you are affecting their pH balance, electrolyte balances, I &amp; O's
3) check MD order for acceptable residual amount prior to feeding
-usually notify provider if residual is greater than 200ml (pt at risk for aspiration and absorption deficiency)
4) theory behind: if you had too much formula in stomach, you would be more likely to throw up or aspirate
-but evidence shows that they will aspirate no matter the amount and the stomach content contains more than just formula but also saliva, etc.

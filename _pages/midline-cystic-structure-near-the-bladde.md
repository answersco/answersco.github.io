Think prostatic utricle cyst or Mullerian duct cyst, less likely ejaculatory duct cyst. They appear very similar.

Prostatic utricle cyst: focal dilation in prostatic urethra
RUG: focal out-pouching from prostatic urethra
Associated with hypospadias, prune belly syndrome, Down syndrome, unilateral renal agenesis, and imperforate anus.
Can get infected.

Mullerian duct cyst: anatomic variant 
Does not have same associated conditions
Also appears as midline cystic structure near bladder of a male
Can contain cancer (endometrial, clear cell, and squamous).

- mullerian duct cyst
- prostatic utricle

- can also be ejaculatory duct cysts

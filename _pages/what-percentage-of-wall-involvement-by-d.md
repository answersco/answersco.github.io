title: "What percentage of wall involvement by delayed enhancement has a high probability of recovering function following revascularization?"
---
DHE ranging from 1% - 25% transmural thickness are likely to regain function after revascularization.

Regions with 25% - 50% transmural DHE may recover function.

Regions with 50% - 100% transmural DHE are unlikely to recover function.

title: "Comparison of agents used for bone pain"
---
Sr89 (metastron): oldest, and worst
-Pure beta emitter
-High myelotoxicity compared to newer agents, and longest recovery
-Renal excretion

Sm153 (quadramet): Samarium is good Samaritan
-Complexes with hydroxyapatite in areas where bone turnover is highest.
-Beta decay, but 28% gamma rays (103 keV) that can be imaged.
-Renal excretion
-Transient BM suppression (mainly thrombocytopenia and leukopenia), but recovers faster than Sr.

Ra23 (Xofigo): newest, and probably the best
-Behaves in similar mechanism as calcium, absorbed into bone matrix at sites of active bone mineralization.
-Emits 4 alpha particles- DS-DNA breaks
-Alpha emitter = shorter range = less hematologic toxicity
-Has shown survival in prostate mets
-Long half-life (11.4 days): easier shipping.
-More common non-hematologic effects, including N/V/D, fatigue, bone pain.

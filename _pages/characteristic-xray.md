title: "Characteristic xray?"
---
e- from filament accelerated toward target by high positive voltage.
Removes inner shell electron of target atom.
Electron from higher shell of target atom falls to lower shell.
Characteristic x-ray emitted whose energy is the difference between the binding energies of the two shells.
Each target material (W, Mo, Rh) generates a unique combination of characteristic x-ray energies.

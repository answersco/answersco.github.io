title: "Effects of dynamic range on US images?"

A smaller dynamic range provides more contrast on the image display, increasing the conspicuity of a low contrast lesion. Conversely, a larger dynamic range has a lower contrast gradient, but the image will appear smoother. Dynamic range is in dB and is a logarithmic scale.

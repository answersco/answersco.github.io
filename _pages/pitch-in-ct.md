Pitch: increasing pitch decreases dose (less overlap)
Pitch = table movement per tube rotation (D) / beam width (W)

Pitch = 1
Beam = the distance the table turns in 1 rotation (no gap)

Pitch &gt; 1
Gap between the slices

Pitch &lt; 1
Overlap&#8594; increases dose

Pitch = (table movement per rotation)/beam width
AKA beam pitch

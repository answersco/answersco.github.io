title: "What factors affect acquisition times for modern MRI techniques?"
---
Echo train length (ETL): inversely related with acquisition time
In fast MRI techniques, acquisition time is &#8595; by a factor equal to the ETL
Example: &#8593; the ETL from 4 to 16&#8594; &#8593; the # of k-space that are filled during each TR period from 4 to 16 &#8594; &#8595; acquisition time by a factor of 4.

Parallel imaging acceleration factor: &#8595; acquisition time
Np is &#8595; through spatial sensitivity of multiple coils.
The image acquisition time is &#8595; by the acceleration factor.

Rectangular FOV: &#8595; acquisition time
Anatomic coverage is &#8595; in the phase-encode direction&#8594; &#8595; Np and thus &#8595; acquisition time.

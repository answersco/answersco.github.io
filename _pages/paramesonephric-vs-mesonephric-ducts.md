title: "Paramesonephric vs mesonephric ducts?"
---
Paramesonephric = Mullerian
Mesonephric = Wolffian
At 6 wks, M and F are indistinguishable constituting two sets of paired ducts. In the absence of Testis-determining factor, the mesonephric ducts begin to degenerate and form a matrix for the developing paramesonephric ducts.

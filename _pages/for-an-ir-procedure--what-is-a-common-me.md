title: "For an IR procedure, what is a common method to optimize the visibility of iodine-based contrast agents and radiation dose?"
---
Adding 0.1-1.0 mm Cu to the beam while adjusting x-ray factors.
Many newer systems add Cu to the beam while adjusting the kV and mAs to maximize the fraction of photons just above the iodine K-absorption edge (37 keV)
Increasing kV would reduce patient dose at the expense of decreasing iodine contrast.
Reducing kV would increase iodine contrast (to a point) at the expense of greatly increasing patient dose.

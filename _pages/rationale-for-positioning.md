1) body alignment.
-pay attention to joints and spine so we do not tork them while their laying
2) patient comfort.
-reduces continuous pressure on pressure points - especially in the elderly 
3) restoration of muscle tone.
4) stimulation of respiratory and circulatory systems.
5) improved elimination.
-emulate how regular elimination would be so maybe in fowlers position and not supine
6) improved psychological well being.
-sit bed up and open curtains to help engage them more
7) facilitate diagnostic tests or surgical interventions
8) prevents complications.

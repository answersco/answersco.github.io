Grave's Disease
- Diffusely increased uptake and enlarged gland
- Increased T4 and markedly decreased TSH

Hashimoto's thyroiditis
Acute - diffusely uniform increased uptake similar to Grave's; this is caused by early decrease in thyroid hormone production with resultant increased TSH secretion; thyroid hormone levels remain relatively normal
Chronic - patchy appearance similar to multinodular goiter; the gland has become infiltrated with areas of fibrosis; low thyroid hormone levels

Subacute thyroiditis - generic terms for types of thyroiditis with a subacute course (includes DeQuervains, postpartum)
- Painful, swollen gland
- Elevated circulating thyroid hormone levels due to release of preformed thyroid hormone upon destruction of thyroid follicles
- Markedly depressed radiotracer uptake within the thyroid
Eventually will become mildly hypothyroid and then will usually return to normal

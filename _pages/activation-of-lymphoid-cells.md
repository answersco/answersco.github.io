Two Separate Signals Required
1) Antigen (presented on epitope) to TCR or B cell surface antibody
2) Cytokine released from activated T Helper cells.

Examples
1) B cell captures antigen (step 1) picks up cytokine released from activated Helper T (step 2) 
2) Cytotoxic T cell is presented antigen on Class I MHC from any nucleated cell (step 1), picks up cytokines released from activated Helper T (step 2)

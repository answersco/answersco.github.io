title: "Timing with in/out of phase imaging"
---
Fat and water protons precess at different rates. A spoiled GRE is performed when protons are spinning with each other (~4.4 msec at 1.5T) and directly out of phase with each other (~2.2 msec at 1.5 T). Microscopic fat will drop on out of phase.

Out of phase imaging at 2.2 msec MUST be done BEFORE in phase at 4.4 seconds
If you compare the 6.6 second out of phase you will not be able to distinguish fatty liver from iron-filled liver
2.2 msec: fat is dark, iron is bright on out of phase
6.6 msec: both fat and iron are dark on out of phase.

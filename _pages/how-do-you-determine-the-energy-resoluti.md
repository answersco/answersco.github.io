title: "How do you determine the energy resolution for a scintillation detector for a source with photopeak energy 662 keV and full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 46 keV?"
---
The energy resolution (%) = E/Ey x 100 and describes the detector's ability to separate radiations of different energies.
Here, ER = 46 keV / 662 keV x 100 = 7%

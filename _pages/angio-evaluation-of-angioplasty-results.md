title: "Angio evaluation of angioplasty results"
---
Most operators judge results of angioplasty visually: rapid flow, decreased filling of collaterals, and improvement of distal pulses if present
-ABI may be measured on procedure table

Irregular lumen with visible fissures in the plaque are common after adequate angioplasty, and shouldn't be interpreted as dissections.

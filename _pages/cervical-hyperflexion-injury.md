title: "Cervical Hyperflexion Injury"
---
Best diagnostic clue
Focal kyphosis, anterior column compression deformity or &quot;teardrop&quot; fracture
Focal kyphosis, increased space between spinous processes; distracted, perched, or jumped facets
Location
Mid or lower cervical spine more common
Hyperflexion injury with axial compression
Hyperkyphosis of spine at level of injury
May show increased distance between adjacent spinous processes (&quot;fanning&quot;)
Blunting of anterior margin of superior endplate extending to anterior vertebral wedging (mild injury)
Oblique coronal fracture through anteroinferior vertebral body with retrolisthesis on lower vertebral body (flexion &quot;teardrop&quot;)
Severe, unstable injury
&#177; distraction of facet joints
Hyperflexion injury with distraction or shear
Hyperkyphosis of spine at level of injury
Increased distance between adjacent spinous processes (&quot;fanning&quot;)
&#177; blunting of anterior margin of superior vertebral endplate
Diastatic (&gt; 2 mm), subluxed (articular apposition &lt; 50%), perched, or jumped facet joints with anterolisthesis
100% anterior displacement = &quot;floating&quot; vertebra

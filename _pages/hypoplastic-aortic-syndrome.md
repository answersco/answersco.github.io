title: "Hypoplastic aortic syndrome"
---
AKA abdominal aortic coarctation: congenital disorder of unknown etiology, primarily occurring in young females, though symptoms may not occur until middle age.

Frequently have risk factors for atherosclerotic disease, and AS occlusive disease is frequently superimposed upon the already small Ao and iliac arteries.

Angio findings are striking, with disproportionately small infrarenal abdominal Ao and iliac arteries.
DDX includes vasculitis, XRT injury, and neurofibromatosis.

Visceral and renal artery involvement occurs when the lesion is centered in the mid-portion of the abdominal Ao, with sparing in disease localized to infrarenal Ao and CIAs.

Tx = surgical bypass

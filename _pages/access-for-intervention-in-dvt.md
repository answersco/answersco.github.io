title: "Access for intervention in DVT"

Access can be achieved from a number of locations, but most prefer the ipsilateral posterior tibial or popliteal vein.
-Thrombosed vein is easier to negotiate in an antegrade fashion. When using jugular vein or contralateral CFV, the venous valves can impede catheter placement.

title: "Saccular aneurysms of descending thoracic Ao"
---
Chronic aortic transection:
-When localized to proximal descending thoracic Ao, CHRONIC AORTIC TRANSECTION should be a strong consideration in a young patient, particularly if the aneurysm is heavily calcified with normal adjacent Ao.

Ductus aneurysm:
-Aneurysms that arise from underside of proximal descending Ao and burrow into middle mediastinum toward the PA may be aneurysms of ductus remant (DUCTUS ANEURYSM)

Penetrating ulcer:
Focal pseudoaneurysms in otherwise normal-caliber but atherosclerotic Ao may be due to PENETRATING ULCERS.

Mycotic aneurysm:
-May have similar appearance, but is often multilobulated. Common perianeurysmal inflammatory reaction.

Vasculitis (e.g. Behcet):
-May also cause focal saccular descending thoracic aortic aneurysms.

title: "Describe beam hardening artifact."
---
Due to the polychromatic nature of the beam. As the lower energy photons are preferentially absorbed, the beam becomes more penetrating, causing underestimation of the HU. Soft ware algorithms have been developed to reduce this which incorporate prior knoledge of the patient.

1-2 WEEKS
- Acute rejection/ATN: 20% prominent pyramids, enlarge kidney and increase RI
----Mag 3 will differentiate 
----(ATN: perfusion normal; Acute rejection: DECREASED perfusion; both have delay excretion)

- Urinoma - rapidly increasing anechoic fluid (MAG3 or US can be used to show this)

1-2 MONTHS
- Lymphocele: medial to the kidney

1-2 YEARS
- Chronic rejection - kidney enlarges, looses corticomedullary differentiation (with high RI)

- Calculous dz: high risk for stone formation

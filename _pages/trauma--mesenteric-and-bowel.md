Must view at abdominal and lung windows
Bowel wall thickening &gt; 3 mm (sensitivity of 75%)
Bowel wall enhancement hyperdense to psoas muscle or isodense to blood vessels
Wall enhancement + thickening + free fluid strongly suggests perforation
Mesenteric infiltration (&quot;stranding&quot;)
Small hemorrhages: Streaky soft tissue infiltration of mesenteric fat
Sentinel clot sign: Localized &gt; 60 HU mesenteric hematoma at site of bleeding
Intra-/retroperitoneal free fluid: Hemoperitoneum or bowel contents
Hemoperitoneum: Present is essentially all bowel or mesenteric injuries
Polygonal fluid collections between folds of mesentery, bowel loops
Indicates bowel &amp;/or mesenteric injury
Does not result from injury to solid viscera
Hematoma (&gt; 60 HU), liquefied blood (35-50 HU)
Bowel content, extravasated enteric contrast (10-30 HU)
Active bleeding = isodense with enhanced vessels
Bowel rupture at sites of oral contrast extravasation
Extraluminal air: Intra- or retroperitoneal air
Not diagnostic of bowel perforation (also seen in barotrauma and mechanical ventilation)
Often seen in subphrenic spaces
Between mesenteric leaves, omental interstices
May be absent even with transmural lacerations
Intramural air and extraluminal air and interloop free fluid
Indicates full thickness tear
Bowel discontinuity: Diagnostic of transmural laceration, but rare finding
Extraluminal oral contrast material: Rare, but specific for perforation 
Seat belt sign: infiltration or hematoma in subcutaneous fat of lower anterior abdominal wall
Highly predictive of injury to bowel and mesentery
Chance fracture: Transverse plane fracture through vertebral body and posterior elements
Highly associated with bowel and mesenteric injuries
Free fluid without apparent solid organ injury
Normal in young woman (physiological)
Small amounts in pelvis of near-water attenuation in men may be due to overhydration
Larger amounts, especially of blood attenuation (&gt; 35 HU), are due to trauma
Look carefully for mesenteric, bowel, or solid visceral injury
Alert clinical team of need for close and repeated monitoring if surgery is to be delayed

PPV1 = PPV for SCREENING EXAMS. PPV benchmark is 4.4% Another way of concepualizing (PPV for BR-0, BR-3, BR-4, BR-5) Notice this is EXCLUDING BR-1 and BR-2 which are things we called BENIGN. Importance is that a SCREENING ONLY facility collects PPV data in this category alone.

PPV2 = PPV when BIOPSY was recommended, i.e., PPV for BR-4 and BR-5. PPV benchmark = 25.4%. 

PPV3 = PPV of the biopsied specimens themselves. PPV benchmark = 31%
&#8212;Other names for PPV3 can be PBR (positive biopsy rate) OR Biopsy yield of malignancy

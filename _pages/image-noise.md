title: "Image Noise"
---
Background variation (this is always there) and is contributing nothing useful to the image
This is related to the NUMBER OF PHOTON hitting the imaging receptor (The MORE photons that hit the background receptor the LESS obvious the background noise will be and you will INCREASE the signal to noise ratio).

not all noise is quantum scatter, some of the noise is related to SCATTER which is caused by 3 main factors:

KvP: increasing kVp increases scatter
Field of view: The SMALLER the FOV, the LESS scatter (this is because less tissue is being irradiated to create interactions). Also, the smaller FOV i.e. smaller target for the scatter to land on.
Thickness: The thicker the skin the MORE interactions occur and therefore more scatter (predominately via comptom interactions)

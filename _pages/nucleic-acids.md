-genetic information
EX. DNA and RNA

monomer: nucleotide structure
polymer: nucleotide polymers aka nucleic acid (DNA and RNA)
1': attaches to nitrogenous base (C,G,T,A,U determine function)
2': carbon determine RNA (OH) or DNA (H)
3': to make longer --&gt; phosphate groups attach or polymerize by adding on
4': no specific function
5': phosphate group
(phosphates and sugars are backbones while the ladder steps are the nitrogenous bases)

title: "Hibernating myocardium - definition - acute or chronic? - perfusion study (normal/abnormal)? - wall motion/contractility (good/bad)? - PET and Thallium study show?"
---
- Chronic process that is a result of severe CAD causing chronic hypoperfusion
--- NOT an infarct

- perfusion: decreased (abnormal and fixed)
- contractility: decreased

- PET: tissue takes up tracer more intense than normal myocardium
- Thallium: redistribute with delayed thallium

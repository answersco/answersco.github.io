title: "Percutaneous cecostomy indications"
---
Cecal dilatation &gt; 10 cm associated with significant risk of perforation. Thus decompression is needed.

Main indication for colonic decompression is colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome). Patients who fail colonoscopic decompression will require cecostomy.

Other indications:
-Cecal dilatation proximal to a distal large bowel obstruction
-Cecal volvulus.

Patients with clinical signs of perforation or bowel necrosis need surgical exploration.

title: "Magnetic Susceptibility Artifact"
---
-Shorter TE's reduce susceptibility artifact because it allows less time for dephasing thus reducing signal loss
- will be blooming on longer TE
- worsened by T2*, GRE, EPI
FIX:
-SHORTER TE's- NON-GRE (best) --FSE or SE - Fast Spin Echo (longer ETL) and Spin Echo sequences are useful
-SMALLER Voxels/thinner slices/increase matrix-
-INCREASE R-BW (fair)
-Use STIR instead of Fat suppression techniques
-Try parallel imaging correction
-Thin Slices
-Add NSE/NEX to buy back signal

Visualization of hilar vessels thorugh a mass- indicates that a mass is actually present.

A mass that arises FROM the hilum will obliterate the view of the sillhouette of the pulmonary vessels

IF you can see this sillhouette then it is NOT arising from the hilum 

(Image) - You can SEE the pulmonary vessel outline therefore this mass DOES NOT arise from the hilum

MIDDLE mediastinum: obliterate and silhouette the pulmonary vessels

Best diagnostic clue
Pointed cerebellar tonsils &#8805; 5 mm below FM, &#177; syringohydromyelia
Oblique or vertical (not horizontal) sulci
Compressed/absent cisterna magna
Location
Craniovertebral junction (CVJ)
Size
Classically &#8805; 5 mm below FM, but morphology more important than extent of descent
Morphology
Pointed, triangular-shaped (peg-like) tonsils
Tonsillar impaction in FM without caudal herniation may be symptomatic
Absent cisterna magna, posteriorly angled odontoid with compressed brainstem, short posterior arch C1, short clivus, syrinx

This is a classic case with caudal protrusion of peg-shaped cerebellar tonsils below the foramen magnum with an associated hydromyelia. Contrast was given to exclude tumor-associated syrinx.

title: "Mirror image artifact"

This violates the rule that one beam is shot out and one beam returns

Basically the sound wave bounces between an echogenic structure and the structure behind it which then makes it return to the probe later
The ultimate results is that you get a duplicate copy of the image just deep the reflector of interest

Where do you see this:

-Classically at the liver lung interface

Type of reverberation artifact with an angled reflector

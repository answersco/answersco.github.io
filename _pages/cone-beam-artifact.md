title: "Cone beam artifact?"
---
Like partial volume avg. Most severe at locations distant from the center of the detector array along the scanner's z-axis. Cone beam artifacts are more pronounced on scanners with a larger number of detector rows and therefore large z-axis coverage. The outer detector rows are farther from the center than the inner detector rows, and therefore cone-beam artifact is more severe in this location. Correction is cone-beam reconstruction algorithms.

title: "US resolution, directions and limitations?"

Axial = depth and is directly related to pulse duration (shorter is higher axial resolution)

Lateral = direction in the scanning plane perpendicular to depth (narrow beam width is better lateral resolution)

Elevation = slice thickness. Fixed for linear array but selectable with Matrix or 1.5D transducers.

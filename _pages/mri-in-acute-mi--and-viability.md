title: "MRI in acute MI: and viability"
---
Can be done in first 24 hours if stable.
Characteristic pattern: zone of enhancement that extends from subendocardium toward epicardium in vascular distribution.

Microvascular obstruction (MVO): independent predictor of death and adverse LV remodeling
-Best seen on 1st pass imaging (25 seconds)
-Seen as islands of dark signal in the enhanced tissue, representing an acute and subacute findings.
-Not seen in chronic disease- turn into scar.

Acute setting (1 week): injured myocardium is T2 bright- can be used to estimate area at risk 
-T2 bright and enhanced = salvageable tissue.

Viability: based on % transmural thickness of the infarct
&lt;25%: likely to improve with PCI
25-50%: may improve
50-100%: unlikely to recover function

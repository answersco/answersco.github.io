title: "What improves your SNR in MRI (in regards to slice thickness, voxel size, matrix size, FOV, slice select gradient, and transmit bandwidth)? What about receiver bandwidth and # of excitations?"
---
Thicker slice
- Therefore, lower SSG slope &amp; thick transmit bandwidth

Voxel size = bigger (double voxel --&gt; 8x volume (2 x 2 x 2) = 8x SNR signal)
Matrix = Smaller
FOV = Larger (double FOV, quadruples pixel area = quadrupled signal)

Increased field strength = more SNR
- smaller surface coil too (compared to coil within the scanner)
- but this increases T1 time (and increases total scan time via TR)

Increased # excitations (but increases time of scan)

Long TR and Short TE (e.g a Proton density!)

<b> RECEIVER BANDWIDTH </b> = You want it NARROWER to increase your SNR. Because if it's wide, you rapid sampling of data and picks up more noise and decreases SNR.

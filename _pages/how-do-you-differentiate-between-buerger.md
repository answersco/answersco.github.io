title: "How do you differentiate between Buergers and Hypothenar hammer syndrome (4)"
---
- HISTORY!!! HHS has repetitive blunt trauma and Buergers has smoking

- look at the ulnar artery: pseudoaneurysm of ulnar artery --&gt; HHS (picture)

- if ulnar artery ok, look at fingers; if they are out, look at fingers (fingers most commonly out with buerger)

- look at superficial palmar arch: it is messed up in HHS

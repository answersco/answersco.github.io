title: "Air kerma"
---
- This is the TOTAL energy deposited from the ionizating radiation, i.e., the PEAK skin dose based on the potential transfer of energy 
- Remember, the photons create kinetic energy in the electrons but they also generate heat. BOTH are considered in the KERMA
- Another way to say what KERMA is, is an estimation of how many photons are in a unit of air prior to energy striking the skin

title: "Catheter tip configurations"
---
End-hole: most common. All lumina open in close proximity to tip.
-May be tripped at tip to achieve appropriate length.

Staggered-tip dual-lumen catheters: designed for therapies that require simultaneous rapid aspiration and infusion with limited mixing (HD, apheresis)
-Should not be trimmed, so staggered-tip configuration is maintained.

Valve-tipped catheters: with slittlike 2-way valve at tip that is closed in resting state. The valve opens inward with aspiration and outward for infusion.
-Potential advantage of not requiring routine heparinization to prevent catheter thrombosis. 
-Example: Groshong catheter
-Vaxcel catheter: has pressure activated safety valve (PASV)

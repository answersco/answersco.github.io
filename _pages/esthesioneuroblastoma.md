title: "Esthesioneuroblastoma?"
---
Malignant neural crest tumor arising from olfactor epithelium

cribriform plate
ddx carcinoma, meningioma, lymphoma, scca
no calcification (fungal sinusitis may calciffy)

Arises from neurosensory receptor cells of olfactory nerve and mucosa. Occurs anywhere from cribriform plate to turbinates. Often quite destructive by time of diagnosis. Usually found high within nasal vault.

Basically this is a neruoblastoma of olfactory cells
It is going to start at the cribiform plate 
Dumbell shape with part in the nasal cavity and the other part in the brian is a good look
these WILL take up octreotide as they are of neural crest origin

Starts at the cribiform plate, looks like a dumbbell. Octreotide positive.

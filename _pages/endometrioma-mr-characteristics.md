title: "Endometrioma MR characteristics"
---
On MRI, endometriomas present as solitary or multiple masses with a homogeneous hyperintense signal intensity on T1

The T1-fatsat helps differentiate endometriomas from mature cystic teratomas, which usually contain fat. 

On T2WI, endometriomas may range from having a low signal intensity (also known as shading) to an intermediate or high signal intensity.

The low signal intensity reflects the hemoconcentration of a cyst. 
Endometriomas generally have a thick, fibrous capsule with low signal intensity on T2, caused by hemosiderin-laden macrophages (figure).

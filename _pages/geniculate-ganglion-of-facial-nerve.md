Geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve
At this level the aditus ad antrum is seen. This is the connection between the tympanic cavity and the antrum.
The labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve coming from the internal auditory canal angles sharply forward, nearly at right angles to the long axis of the petrous bone, to reach the geniculate ganglion. 
At the ganglion the facial nerve makes a U-turn (first genu of the facial nerve) to run posteriorly as the tympanic segment along the medial wall of the epitympanum.

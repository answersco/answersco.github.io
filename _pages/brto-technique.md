-Left adrenal vein selected-usually enlarged due to shunting.
-Long sheath (~30 cm) advanced into vein
-Occlusion balloon (often large, up to 20 mm or more) advanced beyond the adrenal vein inflow and inflated.
-Contrast injected through occlusion balloon with sufficient volume to fill the gastric varices almost to the splenic and/or coronary vein.
-Sclerosing agent injected through balloon catheter or ideally a high-flow microcatheter advanced as deep within the varices as possible.
-Commonly use foam of STS, iodized oil, and room air.
-Sclerosing agent injected under fluoro until the gastric varices are completely filled or reflux is seen into a nontarget vein
-Balloon remains inflated for at least 4 hours to maximize exposure of the varices to the sclerosant.
-Remaining sclerosant aspirated through the microcatheter and balloon catheter
-Contrast gently injected, showing thrombosis of the varices.

title: "Grid use in MM"
---
Since breast is placed in compression and a lower kVp is used (both of which intrinsically decrease scatter), a smaller grid ratio is used
MM uses 4-5 grid ratio (6-16 for general XR)
Use of grid requires change in technique to prevent underexposure&#8594; dose is &#8593; with grid.
Bucky Factor: describes the increase in dose required for a higher grid ratio
2x dose = 2x Bucky Factor
2 for MM; 5 for general XR

No grid used in Mag mode&#8594; Air gap used to prevent scatter
Increasing air gap will increase magnification and increase dose (because of AEC compensation)

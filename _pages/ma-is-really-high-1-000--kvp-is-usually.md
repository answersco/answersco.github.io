title: "MA is really high 1,000  Kvp is usually 80-140  Power 100 Watts, requires good cooling  HVL 10 mm of Aluminum or Copper  effective mA is used in CT which is the mA times the length of time you are in the radiation which depends on your pitch   Slice thickness: in single slice it is the same as the collimated beam  In MDCT you multiple the number of detectors by the collimated beam width thus Pitch = table mvmnt per rotation/ n*beam width  2^12 = 4,096 (12 bits)"

title: "What happens in twin reversed arterial perfusion syndrome?"
---
Intraplacental shutting results in a &quot;pump twin&quot; who pumps blood to other twin, 
- other twin does NOT develop a heart (&quot;acardiac&quot;)

- pump twin usually can do ok if the strain on the heart itself isn't too much
- Look for umbilical artery flow towards the acardiac twin or umbilical vein away from the acardiac twin

title: "Pathogenesis of botulism"
---
-C. botulinum 
-most commonly a food poisoning 
-results from ingestion of toxin (intoxication)

Pathogenesis:
-improperly canned food that have become anaerobic, spores present and germinate in anaerobic environment produce very potent toxin - does not take a lot of the toxin to kill a person so people do not notice a difference in the food because there is not much bacteria in it
-botulin - a neurotoxin: most potent toxin scientists have discovered
-circulates to neuromuscular junctions after secreting into bloodstream from digestive tract
-prevents release of neurotransmitter 
-skeletal muscles fail to contract - flacclid paralysis

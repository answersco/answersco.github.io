title: "Medulloblastoma"
---
T2, T1, ADC- restricts dt high cellularity- PNET, mets to cord

WHO IV, aggressive, peds, drop mets &quot;sugar coat or Zukerguss&quot;

Cellular- hyperattenuating mass, avidly enhancing, cerebellar vermis -midline- eccentric in ynger *restriction on ADC. 
Small blue cell origin. 
Image whole cns for lepto mets.

PNET originating from roof of 4th ventricle
-2-8 yrs
-Radiosensitive but mets early via CSF

Associations:
Gorlins syndrome: basal cell nevi, odontogenic keratocysts, falx calcification

Turcot's syndrome: colon polyps and CNS malignancy

malignant tumor cerebellum; invades fourth ventricle
Think about this as arising from the ROOF of the fourth ventricle
These are HYPERDENSE on CT 
They like to DROP MET (leptomeningeal carcinomatosis) or zuckerguss

-midline vermis in kids, cerebellum in young adults
-CT hyperdense (hypercellular)
-heterogeneous enhancement, necrosis, calcs
-restrict diffusion
-drop mets, Zuckerguss (need to image whole spine)
DDx: ependymoma

Associated with basal cell nevus syndrome (Gorlin sx) (dural calcs, skin cancer after XRT, odontogenic cysts)

Turcots syndrome: GBM, medulloblastoma, GI hyperplastic and adenomatous polyps

PEDS tumor (75% &lt; 10 yrs, MC malignant PEDS brain tumor), &quot;metal ball,&quot; ROOF of 4th ventricle, spherical, T1/T2 heterogenous, enhancing homogeneously, highly cellular / restricts diffusion / type of PNET, METS VIA CSF PATHWAYS, &quot;zuckerguss&quot; drop mets. A/W Gorlin-Goltz basal cell nevus syndrome of basal cell ca s/p radiation &amp; Turcot's polyposis syndrome

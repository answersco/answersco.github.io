title: "If you see lots of CSF, how can you distinguish between the different conditions?"
---
First, look at cortex:
- if cortical mantle extremely thinned/gone --&gt; hydranencephaly
- if cortical mantle present, check for presence of a falx:
---- if no falx: holoprosencephaly
---- if falx present: hydrocephalus

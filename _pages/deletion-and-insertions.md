NOT in multiples of 3:
-cause a frameshift mutation that alters the amino acids after the mutation
-worst type of mutation bc amino acids after are all changed

IN multiple of 3:
-do NOT cause a frameshift
-can still alter the phenotype
-adds or deletes amino acid but may not affect it bc the other amino acids remain the same

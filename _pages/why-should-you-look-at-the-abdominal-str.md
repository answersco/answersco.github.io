title: "Why should you look at the abdominal structures?"
---
Even if you don't suspect any abdominal pathology, you should look at the abdominal cavity. 
Gas should be visible in the stomach and sometimes in the hepatic and splenic flexures of the colon. 
Free air forming below the diaphragm could indicate a pneumoperitoneum, leading to concerns of a perforated viscus. A large bubble of gas with a fluid level in the middle of the chest can indicate a hiatus hernia. Chest and upper abdominal pathology can mimic each other clinically, making assessment of the abdomen on the chest radiograph an important part of the routine. The converse is true&#8212;abdominal pain may be caused by lower lobe lung pathology, such as consolidation, and can be detected on the chest radiograph.

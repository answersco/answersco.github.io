An anteroinferior red mass is probably a glomus tympanicum
A red mass that crosses the TM is aberrant ICA
A blue mass posteriorly is probably a dehiscent jugular bulb
A white mass inferiorly suggests congenital cholesteatoma
A white mass superiorly is a CN7 schwannoma.
A blue bulging TM is a cholesterol granuloma.

title: "If you have the stomach AND the heart both on the right side of the body, what's the term?"
---
Situs inversus totalis (e.g. look at heart and stomach bubble)

Situs inversus incompletus = left sided heart but RIGHT SIDED STOMACH

Right-sided heart but left sided stomach? = Polysplenia situs AMBIGUUS &quot;bilateral left sidedness&quot;

(situs solitus = NORMAL!)

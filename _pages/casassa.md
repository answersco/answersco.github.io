title: "Casassa"
---
one of the three &quot;flavors&quot; of provocation; case that reflects MPC approach to murder/provocation (a reasonable person would lose their rational faculties in that situation); ultimate test = objective (Was there a REASONABLE explanation for the defendant's emotional disturbance?); we first view the subjective situation of the defendant (Did defendant in fact lose his faculties?) and then assess objectively (Was this excuse for EED reasonable?); defendant passed subj. test but failed obj. test so murder conviction upheld

title: "Ulcerative colitis"
---
Endoscopy- abnormal erythematous mucosa, uniform, involving only the large colon

Also in young people
involves the rectum 95% of the time and has RETROGRADE progression
Terminal ileum is involved 5-10% of the time via BACKWASH ileitis
CONTINUOUS process 
Associations: colon cancer, primary sclerosing cholangitis, arthritis
imaging: typically defined as LEAD PIPE for the colon which means its featureless

Important note:

Typically UC does not have increased lymph node size so if you see an enarlged ymph node in a UC patient you need to htink that this could be related to cancer (espiecially if long standing UC).

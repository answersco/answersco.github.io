Many U.S. presidents have nicknames. Calvin Coolidge was known as Silent Cal because he rarely spoke. The Little Magician was Martin Van Buren, who wore a tall silk hat. Grover Cleveland earned the nickname Veto President because he vetoed more bills than all previous presidents combined. Andrew Jackson's nickname was Old Hickory, while Theodore Roosevelt's was Rough Rider. The Great Emancipator was Abraham Lincoln, who wrote a proclamation that emancipated, or freed, slaves.

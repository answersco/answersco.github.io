The &quot;people's liberator,&quot; who defeated the Spanish and established &quot;Gran Colombia&quot; (1819-1830) in the north of Latin America. Although Gran Colombia eventually broke down into (somewhat) the present-day borders of Latin America, it demonstrated the revolutionary potential of liberal ideals against conservatism.

title: "If a premature baby is in the NICU on a VENTILATOR, what 2 pathologies can occur based on time frame?"

1. 1st week of life = Pulmonary Interstitial Emphysema (PIE) = Linear LUCENCIES
- surfactant therapy can mimic this!
- impending pnx

2. &gt; 2 weeks = Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia = Hazy lungs with Band-like OPACITIES; diffusely hyperinflated lungs; if big heart, think pulm HTN development

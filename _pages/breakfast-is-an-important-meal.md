title: "Breakfast is an important meal."
---
Do you eat breakfast every day? Researchers have found that people who eat a balanced breakfast are likely to be healthier than those who don't. One reason is that most people eat whole grains at breakfast and these promote good health. Breakfast eaters also tend to have fewer weight problems than those who skip a meal. People who don't eat breakfast usually eat too much later in the day. Often, these foods are not healthy and cause weight gain and other problems. So, be sure to eat breakfast. It is the most important meal of the day.

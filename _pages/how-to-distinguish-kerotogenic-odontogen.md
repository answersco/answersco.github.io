title: "How to distinguish Kerotogenic odontogenic tumor from Ameloblastoma?"
---
Keratogenic Odontogenic Tumor = Usually multi-locular and growing along the length of the mandible body/ramus WITHOUT cortical expansion
* VERY CIRCUMSCRIBED and LYTIC
- Multiple = Gorlin Syndrome (Medulloblastoma, Dural Calcs, Basal cell skin cancer after radiation, and odontogenic cysts)

Ameloblastoma = Aggressive, SOFT TISSUE / SOLID COMPONENT, Enhancing, Soap Bubble lesion; Mandibular Expansion
- interestingly, 5% arise from dentigerous cysts (the ones that &quot;displace&quot;)

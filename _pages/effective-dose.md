Effective Dose = SUM (WT x Organ Dose). All organs are chosen so W add up to 1. units Sv

Term defined to normalize the absorbed dose to the tissue sensitivity and type of radiation that is exposing the tissue. Effective Dose is determined by multiplying the equivalent dose by a tissue specific weighting factor. Units Sv (J/kg).

DLP x K (weighting factors based on CT body part)

Effective dose = DLP x K (k=body part constant)
Effective dose is going to be in Sv.

the amount of a drug needed to achieve a specific psychoactive effects; ED50 means 50% of the population gets the desired effect with that amount of the drug

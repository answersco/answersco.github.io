title: "Normal excretory phase in a renal scan takes place at how many minutes? What ratio do you look at?"
---
7-10 minutes (should be down to half peak counts in normal kidney)

20/3 or 20/peak ratio = comparing peak count at 20 minutes compared with peak count at 3 minutes (normally &lt; 0.8) or peak count itself after 20 minutes (normally &lt; 0.3)

Classic imaging appearance on nuclear pertechnetate scan is focal accumulation in right lower quadrant that is coincident with, and as intense as, gastric uptake and increases in visibility with time
Nuclear scintigraphy is most accurate: Radiographs, sonography, CT scan, or barium studies show nonspecific signs of right lower quadrant inflammatory process
Location
Within 2 feet of ileocecal valve
Right lower quadrant or midline/periumbilical in location
Size
5-6 cm in length, though inflammatory mass may be much larger

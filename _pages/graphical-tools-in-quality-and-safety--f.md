---
Flow-chart: used to diagram the steps in a process in order to identify decision or stress points, areas of vulnerability, and opportunities for improvement.
They represent a common understanding of the process and enable the team to examine individual steps in order to identify problems and improvement opportunities.

Flowcharts are used to:
1. Clarify the steps and decision points in a process.
2. Identify the complexity/variability of the process, as well as its management.
3. Clarify outcome vs. process steps
4. Establish measures for procedures within a process.

Terminator: oval box shape- represents the start or end of the process
Process: rectangular box- normal process flow step
Decision: diamond shape- branch in the process flow
Connector: small labeled circle- illustrates a jump in the process flow
Data: parallelogram- data input or output for a process
Document- used to indicate a document or report

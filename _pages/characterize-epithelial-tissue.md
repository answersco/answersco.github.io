title: "Characterize epithelial tissue"
---
-cellularity: comprised of almost all cells
-contacts: holding cell types together (desmosenes and tight junctions)
-avascular: rely on diffusion to get nutrients, waste, and signaling molecules in and out
-polarity: apical and basal surfaces
-regeneration: high rate bc epithelial serves as protection so it has a lot of wear and tear
-functions: protection, control of permeability, sensations, secretion

title: "Value in healthcare"
---
Quality and cost are both major components of &quot;value&quot; in healthcare
Value is closely related to efficiency, which can be defined as the ratio of results achieved to resources expended. 
Reducing cost can sometimes increase value, but the term is not synonymous with cost-cutting. Efficient use of resources which produces the desired level of quality is a better definition.
Measurement of value: requires that one first be able to measure quality, as well as to compare costs to accepted benchmarks.

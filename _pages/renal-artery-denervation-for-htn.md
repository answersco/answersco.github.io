title: "Renal artery denervation for HTN"
---
Sympathetctomy may be considered for severe HTN after exclusion of anatomic etiologies or other causes such as primary hyperaldosteronism.
Techniques for renal denervation disrupt the sympathetic plexus around the renal artery using imaging to guide application of ablative energy.
Catheter tip directed into intima of renal artery, after which the artery is treated in 4-6 locations between the renal artery bifurcation and ostium in a spiral pattern.

title: "Meconium Plug Syndrome"
---
Best diagnostic clue
Contrast enema: Small left colon to splenic flexure
Morphology
Distal colon spastic + narrowed, causes functional obstruction usually at splenic flexure

neonatal intestinal obstruction due to COLONIC inertia
*not small bowel
no association with cystic fibrosis
same spectrum as small left colon syndrome

Small left colon/functional immaturity of colon/meconium plug &#8594; NO MICROCOLON
More common in preterm neonates, neonates born to mothers who received magnesium for eclampsia/preeclampsia, and infants born to diabetic mothers.
Imaging: distal obstructive pattern.
Contrast enema: small left colon, typically with a discrete transition in caliber at the splenic flexure. There may be filling defects within the small left colon, representing meconium plugs.
Primary differential consideration is Hirschsprung disease with a transition at splenic flexure. In contrast to small left colon, Hirschsprung disease would not feature a distensible rectum and would not resolve after enema.

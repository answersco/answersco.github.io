title: "What are important acute complications of CC fistula?"
---
Vision loss: elevated intraorbital pressure and chronic congestion in CC fistula causes pressure on the optic nerve, which can lead to blindness if untreated.

Varix of cavernous sinus, congested draining cerebral veins, or SOV can rupture- leads to massive SAH.

The carotid sinus drains into the inferior petrosal sinus into the sigmoid sinus and then the IJ.

CN III, IV, V1, V2, and VI run in lateral wall of cavernous sinus.

-organoaxial: greater curvature flips over lesser curvature; older women with paraesophageal hernias

-mesenteroaxial: kids, causes obstruction and ischemia

Two type:

1. Organoaxial: this is greater curvature flipping over the lesser curvature in old people with paraesophageal hernias (this makes sense). WAY more common.

2. Mesenteroaxial: This is flipping around the mesenteric root (the greater curvature remains inferior while the pylorus goes way superior (see image). This is associated with ischemia and needs to be fixed. This type can cause obstruction and is more common in kids.

Two types
See image for good description
Mesenteroaxial causes more problems like ischemia (I think you can just think about this because it is clamping the mesenteric vessels)
This is also the one that is more common in kidsh

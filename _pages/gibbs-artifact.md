title: "Gibbs artifact"
---
AKA truncation artifact
Phase encoding &gt; frequency encoding
Ripples at high contrast interfaces
Classically CSF cord interface -&gt; mimics syrinx
Due to undersampling of FID
Fixed by:
- bigger matrix
- decreased bandwidth
- decreased pixel size
Tradeoff for larger matrix:
- increased acquisition time
- decreased SNR

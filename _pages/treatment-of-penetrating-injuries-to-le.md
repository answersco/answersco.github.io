title: "Treatment of penetrating injuries to LE"
---
Injury to upper thigh may involve branches of the PFA or inferior gluteal arteries
-At least 2 views through area of suspected injury are necessary to exclude subtle intimal injury

-Small intimal flaps and AVF usually heal spontaneously
-Injuries to branch vessels can be treated with coil embo
-Open repair is standard for major injuries to SFA or popliteal artery, though stent-grafts may have a role
-Injury to a single tibial artery can be managed with coil occlusion or ligation if appropriate.

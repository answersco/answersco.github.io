title: "Method to reduce scatter"
---
Grid&#8594; more strips = higher grid ratio = more scatter reduction
Linear grid: needs to be aligned parallel with anode-cathode to avoid grid cut-off.
Bucky grid = moving grid&#8594; grid lines if grid motion fails
Bucky factor describes the increased mAs required when a particular grid is used compared to a study using no grid
Air gap: only done with mag view on MM &#8594; small amount of distance between patient and detector will reduce the scattered photons being registered.
Grid results in increased dose (because ABC increases output to compensate)

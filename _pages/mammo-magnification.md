title: "Mammo magnification"
---
- Small focal spot used: recovers spatial resolution lost by magnification of 1.2-2.0, reduces penumbra, requires lower mA resulting in longer exposure time.
- Scatter radiation reduced using air gap instead of grid
-Increases dose
- Reduced spatial resolution
- Improved effective resolution

title: "Perc chole: catheter care and follow-up"
---
-Catheters need to be irrigated 2-3 times per day because biliary sludge can clog the 8-Fr catheters.
-Must be left in place for minimum of 2 weeks before removal to ensure formation of a mature track between the GB and skin surface. If it is removed before a mature tract develops, bile contamination of peritoneal cavity may result.
-Before removing the chole catheter, a cholecystocholangiogram is performed to ensure patency of the cystic duct and to exclude the presence of of gallstones in the cystic duct, GB, or bile duct.
-If stones are present in GB, the patient may require cholecystectomy or perc cholecystolithotomy if patient is unfit for surgery.
-If an occluding stone is present in cystic duct, the catheter should not be removed until stone is managed surgically or percutaneously.
-If there is a stone in the CBD, the patient will require ERCP and stone removal, or stone can be removed percutaneously.

title: "B. DHE consistent with myocarditis. The image shows DHE (arrow) along the inferolateral wall of the left ventricle epicardium. The subendocardium is normal in this region. This finding is consistent with myocarditis as opposed to myocardial infarction in which DHE always involves at least the subendocardium. The structure within the left ventricular cavity is a normal papillary muscle seen in cross-section, not a thrombus or tumor."

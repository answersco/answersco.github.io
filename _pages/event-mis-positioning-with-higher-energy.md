title: "Event mis-positioning with higher energy photons?"
---
If a high energy photon has a compton scatter interaction with the crystal it produces fewer scintillation photons and the scattered photon can then interact in the crystal elsewhere producing scintillation photons which mis-position the initial incident photon. You can reject counts that are outside the expected energy window to reduce error from scatter within the crystal.

Radiotracer: Tc-99m sulfur colloid &#8594; taken up by reticuloendothelial cells (liver, spleen, and bone-marrow) and Kupffer cells in the liver
80-90% of sulfur colloid particles taken up by liver &#8594; most of the remainder is taken up by the spleen, and a small amount in the bone marrow (not normally seen at typical windowing levels).
Although Tc-99m has a physical half-life of 6 hours, sulfur colloid is rapidly cleared with a biologic half-life of 2-3 minutes

title: "Which type of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is most likely to be imaged for fractures?"
---
Answer: Type 3. All are genetic defects of collagen.
Type 1: least severe, with gracile, thin tubular bones and osteopenia.
-Most common

Type II: most severe, typically lethal.
-2nd most common

Type III: most severe form that survives into childhood or adulthood. Bones are short and thick with multiple fractures and hypertrophic callus, with common non-union and malunion or bowing deformities.

Type IV: like Type I, except Type IV is more likely to have basilar skull impression.
-Least common.

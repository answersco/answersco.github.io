title: "Image linearity and spatial resolution"
---
Lead bar phantoms with parallel lines placed between the collimator and a Co-57 sheet are used to test resolution and linearity.

Performed weekly

Resolution: defined as ability to differentiate between 2 distinct points (tell the bars are separate)
Linearity: tested by looking to see if all the bars are straight

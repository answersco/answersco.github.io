title: "P values:"

p values: in testing a hypothesis, &#945; is the predetermined level of statistical significance which the investigator sets as the maximum acceptable chance of committing a Type I error (defined as rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.
The p value is the observed significance level of a statistical test, as determined by analyzing the data.
The p value is the probability of seeing an effect as big as or bigger than the one observed in the study by chance (i.e. if the null hypothesis were true)
It measures the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis
A non-significant result (p value &gt; &#945;) does not prove the null hypothesis&#8594; it means that there is insufficient evidence to doubt the validity of the null hypothesis.

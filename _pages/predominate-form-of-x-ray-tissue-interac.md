title: "Predominate form of X-ray tissue interaction in breast mammography"
---
This is going to be PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECTS
The avg tube current in breast radiology is approximately 25 KeV which means the beam energy is closer to 10-15 KeV
In tissue, energy levels at 25 KeV are going ot have EQUAL photoelectric and comption
Below this level, photoelectric will predomiante 
Above this level compton will predominate

title: "Collateral supply to liver"
---
Occlusion of common hepatic artery: results in reversal of flow in the gastroduodenal from the pancreaticoduodenal and gastroepiploic arteries.

L gastric artery can also provide collateral supply through the right gastric artery.
The right gastric artery is an important collateral in setting of proper hepatic artery occlusion.

Within liver parenchyma, the R and left hepatic arteries have a rich potential collateral network.

Liver can recruit supply from phrenic, intercostal, and internal mammary arteries, most commonly in setting of vascular liver tumor.

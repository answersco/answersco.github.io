title: "Uterine artery systolic: diastolic ratio"
---
Resistance in the umbilical artery should progressively decrease with gestational age.

General rule is 2-3 at 32 weeks, and no more than 3 at 34 weeks

High resistance patterns: seen in pre-eclampsia and IUGR, with worse prognosis for absent or reversed diastolic flow.

title: "Internal hernias"
---
Most commonly manifest as closed-loop obstruction (often with strangulation). Herniation occurs through either a known anatomic foramen/recess, or one that has been created post-operatively.

Paraduodenal: by far most common internal hernia
Left = 75%. Herniation at the duodenojejunal junction (fossa of Landzert). Herniated SB can become trapped in a &quot;sac of bowel&quot; between the pancreas and stomach, to the left of the ligament of Treitz. The sac classically contains the IMV and left colic artery.

Right: located just behind the SMA and just below the transverse segment of duodenum, at the Fossa of Waldeyer.
Classic setting is non-rotated SB, with normally rotated colon.

title: "GI bleed study"
---
tc99m rbc: advantages - can detect from 0.2-0.5 cc/min bleed and rescan for up to 24 hours - good for intermittent bleed. Need at least 5 cc accumulation to detect (corresponding to that 0.2-0.5 cc/min). Disadvantages: lengthy protocol.
Tc99m sulfur colloid: advantages: can detect incredibly small bleeds: 0.05 cc/min. Disadvantages: extremely small imaging window. They have to be bleeding actively at the time of scan or your will miss it. 
angiography: can detect over 0.5 cc/min. need to be bleeding a little more than in nuc med scans. is better than colonoscopy though and can offer treatment at the time of scan as well as detection.

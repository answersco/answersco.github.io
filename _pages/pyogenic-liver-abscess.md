title: "Pyogenic liver abscess"
---
If you see ONE, then think of Klebsiella
If you see MULTIPLE, then think of E coli
Amebic abscess: IF you see one of these in the left lobe of the liver, it needs ot be drained immediately as it can rupture into the pericardial space 
Hydatid cyst: looks like a water lil on CT and like a sand storm on ultrasound
Schistosomiasis: Toroise shell (see iamge)

DOUBLE TARGET SIGN: central low density, rim enhancement, with even more peripheral low density is the CLASSIC sign of a liver abscess on CT

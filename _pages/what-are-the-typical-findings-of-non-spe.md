title: "What are the typical findings of non-specific interstitial pneumonitis? Prognosis?"
---
Bilateral symmetrical ground-glass opacities, sometimes crazy paving pattern, fine reticular/lacy pattern with subpleural sparing. No significant honeycombing. NSIP has a much better prognosis than UIP but is less common.

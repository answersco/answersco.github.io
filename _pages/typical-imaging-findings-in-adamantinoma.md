title: "Typical imaging findings in adamantinoma"
---
Adamantinoma is a rare, low-grade osseous malignancy that has a predilection for the anterior cortex of the tibial diaphysis. Fibular cases have also been reported. It is expansile, multilocular with areas of sclerosis and lysis, and has a narrow zone of transition. Cortical breakthrough occurs in 15% to 50% of cases. Soft tissue mass and solid periosteal reaction are associated with cortical breakthrough.

title: "What buttresses are involved in LeFort fractures?"
---
All LeFort fractures involve pterygomaxillary disruption: separation of a portion of the maxilla from the central skull base, which occurs via fractures through the posterior maxillary buttresses at the junction with the pterygoid bone.
LeFort I: involves the medial and lateral maxillary buttresses inferiorly (medial and lateral orbital walls)
LeFort II: disruption of the superior medial maxillary buttress, via fractures through the orbital floor and medial orbital wall.
LeFort III: involvement of the zygomatic arches, as well as the superior buttresses involving the medial and lateral orbits.

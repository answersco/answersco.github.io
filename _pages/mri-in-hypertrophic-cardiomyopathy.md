Most common variant: asymmetric hypertrophy involving the interventricular septum &#8594; may narrow the LVOT (HOCM)
MRI: excellent demonstration of extent of hypertrophy in HCM, especially in the area of the ventricular apex
May see flow void in LVOT due to turbulent flow from narrowing
VENC: can be used to quantify the &#8593; velocity through the LVOT
Commonly see mitral regurgitation
Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM): occurs in the presence of LVOT obstruction due to the anterior leaflet of the MV getting sucked/pushed into the LVOT by accelerated flow
DHE should be performed due to likelihood of scar tissue within hypertrophied myocardium &#8594; can be nidus for arrhythmias
DHE can be diffuse or focal, often mid-myocardial or subepicardial, and usually involving the areas with most severe hypertrophy &#8594; indicates &#8593; fibrosis

-condition where the corpus cavernosum does not fill with blood to allow for penile erection
-injected: relax the vascular smooth muscle to allow for the corpus cavernosum to become filled with blood
-orally: increase nitrous oxide levels in the corpus cavernosum: by increasing the nitrous oxide level it activates the enzyme cGMP which is cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which contributes to smooth muscle relaxation. By activating this enzyme cGMP and causing the smooth muscles to relax it will allow for the corpus cavernosum to become filled with blood

title: "In PET and SPECT, is the attenuation correction performed on the raw data or the reconstructed data?"
---
Raw data in PET, reconstructed in SPECT. AC can be simply done along a line of response in PET prior to reconstruction to weight those counts more. In SPECT, because there is depth-dependence, this has to be done after (or as part of) the reconstruction process.

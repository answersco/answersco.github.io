title: "What is a bucket handle tear of the meniscus?"
---
Medial tear that flips medially to lie ANTERIOR to the PCL 

- &quot;Double PCL sign&quot;
- Double PCL sign indicates the ACL is actually intact!

* Double PCL Doesn't occur with lateral meniscus tear b/c the ACL blocks the fragment from entering posterior notch

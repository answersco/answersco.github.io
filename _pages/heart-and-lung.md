title: "Heart and lung"
---
-when either heart or lungs aren't working properly will have to worry about the other eventually bc they are connected 
-pleural cavity: fluid in b/w parietal and visceral pleura so lungs can move 
-pnemothorax- collapsed lung; air in pleura space;
-can put in chest tube to reinflate lung then when it heals you take it out

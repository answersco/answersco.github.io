title: "Internal pudendal and prostatic arteries"
---
Internal pudendal artery: exits the floor of the pelvis between the piriformis and coccygeus muscles, then traveling anteriorly along the lateral border of the pelvis.
The inferior rectal artery arises as a branch of the internal pudendal in this region.
In males, the internal pudendal artery bifurcates into the perineal artery (to scrotum) and common penile artery.

Prostatic artery arises as branch of the internal pudendal in 50%, as a discrete branch of the anterior division in 25%, and as branches of obturator or inferior gluteal in the remainder. It often gives branches to the bladder and seminal vesicles.
It bifurcates at the prostate to anterior and posterior capsular arteries, with anastomoses of anterior branch with internal pudendal in 25%.

title: "PET spatial resolution"
---
Spatial resolution ~ 4-6 mm for whole-body imaging
~2.2 mm for PET cameras for brain imaging (e.g. high resolution research tomograph, HRRT)
~1-2 mm for application-specific designs dedicated to the breast and prostate.
3D mode (septa retracted) &#8594; &#8593; coincidence efficiency by about a factor of 5 in comparison to a 2D acquisition (septa extended)
At the expense of &#8593; randoms, &#8593; scattered coincidences, and &#8593; system dead-time.

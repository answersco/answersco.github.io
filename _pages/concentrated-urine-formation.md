title: "Concentrated urine formation"

-Exercising? Dehydrated?
-secrete ADH!
-aquaporins added to cells of DCT and CD
-water leaves DCT and CD, enters ISF, is reabsorbed
-urea contributes!
-move urea out of CD -- Makes ISF hypertonic -- More water is reabsorbed
-urea recycling means some urea need not be excreted, just keeps moving from filtrate to ISF and back again, driving water reabsorption

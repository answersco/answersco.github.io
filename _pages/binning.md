title: "Binning"
---
This is the process of combining multiple detector elements to make ONE detector element
&#8212;This process INCREASES signal/noise ratio by decreasing hte amount of QUANTUM MOTTLE
&#8212;Binning is MOST useful when you are using LARGE F.O.V. Because there are SO MANY pixels that you're going to get a shit ton of quantum mottle 
&#8212;Importance: binning allows you to DECREASE radiation dose

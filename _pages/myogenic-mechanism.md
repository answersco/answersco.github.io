title: "Myogenic mechanism"
---
-afferent arteriole smooth muscle contracts in response to high blood pressure
-triggered by stretch
-relaxes in response to low BP
In this way, GFR kept relatively constant
-susceptible to hypertension
-if GFR wasn't held steady, kidneys would be susceptible to glomerular rupture, leading to scarring (nephrosclerosis) and kidney failure

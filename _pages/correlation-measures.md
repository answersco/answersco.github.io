title: "Correlation measures"
---
A correlation analysis measures and interprets the strength of a linear or nonlinear relationship between 2 continuous variables
Pearson (parametric) and Spearman (nonparametric) correlation coefficients each have values between -1 and +1 &#8594; the sign of the correlation indicates the direction of the relationship, and the absolute value of the coefficient indicates the strength of the correlation.
Pearson correlation coefficient: used only with interval or continuous outcome data
Spearman (rank) coefficient: can be used with ordinal or continuous outcome variables. As with other nonparametric tests, the Spearman coefficient is less influenced by skewed data and outliers.
Correlation analysis is often used for observational studies and to generate hypotheses for further testing. It is of limited utility for establishing causation: high correlation is insufficient to prove causation.

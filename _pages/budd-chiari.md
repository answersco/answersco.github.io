Budd-Chiari Syndrome (BCS): hepatic venous outflow obstruction
May be thrombotic or non-thrombotic, rarely due to congenital HV anomaly
Acute BCS: presents with clinical triad of hepatomegaly, ascites, and abdominal pain
Vascular findings: lack of flow within the hepatic veins, thrombus in HVs/IVC, and formation of collateral vessels
Acute findings: edematous peripheral liver with sparing of the caudate lobe (drains into IVC)
Progressive liver failure may result in chronic disease&#8594; produces caudate lobe hypertrophy, and atrophy of the peripheral liver with prominent regenerative nodules.

hetero liver +C spares caudate, nodules can enhance

Hepatic venous outflow obstruction, can be thrombotic or non-thrombotic

-hepatic vein occlusion
-regenerative nodules
-peripheral enhancement, central hypodense
-nutmeg liver

title: "T1"
---
This is the time it takes for 63% relaxation back to the LONGITUDINAL DIMENSION
The T1 affect is altered by the lattice 
The T1 affect (regrowth) happens due to an exchange of HEAT 
The T1 time INCREASES as the field strength increases (you have more longitudinal component to begin with)
Things with SHORT T1 are BRIGHT

T1 weighted imaging = SHORT TR and SHORT TE

AKA longitudinal relaxation or spin-lattice relaxation
Defined as 63% recovery of final value
Greater field strength -&gt; longer T1 (which requires longer TR)
Short T1 -&gt; bright
Maximized by short TR

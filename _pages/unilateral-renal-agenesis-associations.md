May have oligohydramnios

Women: 70% with unilateral renal agenesis have associated GU anomalies (usually unicornuate uterus or rudimentary horn)

Men: 20% missing the epipdidymis and vas deferens on the side of the absent kidney. Also have ipsilateral seminal vesicle cyst.

Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser: mullerian duct anamlies including absence or atresia of the uterus/unicornuate uterus. Associated with unilateral renal agenesis.

Bilateral agenesis is potter-sequence related, and could be due to ACE-inhibitor treatment in mother. Develop pulmonary hypoplasia.

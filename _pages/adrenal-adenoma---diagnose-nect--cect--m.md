title: "Adrenal adenoma - diagnose NECT, CECT, MR - functional?"
---
NECT: &lt; 10 HU

CECT:
Absolute washout: (Enhanced - Delayed) / (Enh - Unenhanced) x 100
&gt; 60% = adenoma (WASHOUT/total enhancement)

Relative washout (Enhanced - Delayed) / Enhanced x 100
&gt; 40% = adenoma (WASHOUT/Enhancent)

MRI: signal dropout on in-phase to OUT-of-phase

Most are nonfunctional, 
Cushing's (cortisol) (adenoma and carcinoma)
Conn (aldosterone)- usually a functional adenoma.

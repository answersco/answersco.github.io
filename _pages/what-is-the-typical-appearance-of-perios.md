title: "What is the typical appearance of periosteal chondroma?"

They have a predilection for the metaphysis of long bones. Radiographically, the lesion causes saucerization of the cortex with sclerotic margination and dense periosteal reaction along the proximal and distal ends of the lesion. Lesion matrix mineralization is present in approximately 75% of cases. The lesions are hypointense on T1-weighted and hyperintense on T2-weighted MR images, owing to the chondroid composition.

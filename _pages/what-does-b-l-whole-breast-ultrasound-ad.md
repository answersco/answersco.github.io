title: "What does b/l whole breast ultrasound add?"
---
Bilateral whole breast ultrasound increases the cancer detection rate 3-4 per 1,000 over mammography alone.

* It should be considered a supplement to, not a replacement for, mammography for patients with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts.

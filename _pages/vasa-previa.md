-fetal vessels cross internal cervical os
Type 1: fetal vessels connect to velamentous cord insertion
Type 2: fetal vessels connect to bilobed or succenturiate placenta

Presence of fetal (not placental) blood vessels that cross the internal cervical os (marginal or velamentous cord insertions or with succenturiate lobes).

Vessel crossing internal cervical os. 
Velamentous insertion- Umbilical cord outside of placenta margin.
Succenturiate lobe-separate placental tissue connected to main placenta by blood vessels

Traversing of fetal placental vessels across internal cervical os, can be caused by velamentous insertion or a placental succenturiate lobe.

This is where the placental vessels cross or almost cross the cervical os

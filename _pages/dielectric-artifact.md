title: "Dielectric Artifact"
---
-Are caused by local Eddy currents due to an increased conductivity of body tissue.
-Impacts MRI studies by causing an increase in Inhomogeneity 
-particularly prominent in 3Tesla body imaging and obese patients
FIX: multichannel transmission if available and dielectric pads around pt

Large-scale signal non-uniformity. Shading often near center of field of view.
Origin: Variation in tissue conductivity. More prominent with higher field strength scanners (e.g., 3T) with ascites, obese patients. The wavelength of the MRI RF excitation pulse becomes comparable in size or smaller to the human torso width.
Solution: The placement of dielectric pads, which contain fluid that increase the electrical conductivity near the patient, is routinely used to remediate dielectric effect-based artifacts to some degree

This is going to be due to eddy currents
This is most significant when imaging large body parts (like the abdomen)'
Classic location is going to be left lobe of the liver
You can optimize this by placing a dielectric pad or by using parallel RF transmission

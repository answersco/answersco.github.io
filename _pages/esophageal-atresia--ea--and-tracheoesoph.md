Esophageal atresia (EA) and tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF)
50% with associated anomalies, most commonly VACTERL association
Most common TER is type A (82%): proximal EA with distal TEF
Classic XR findings include NG tube terminating in mid-esophagus with air-filled bowel from distal TEF.
Less common B type (8%): may present with gasless abdomen due to EA without fistula.
H-type (6%): features continuous esophagus without EA, but with an upper esophageal TEF &#8594; may present later with aspiration.
EA should be considered in utero if there is polyhydramnios and lack of visualization of the stomach.
TEF is often associated with tracheal anomalies, including tracheomalacia and bronchus suis (RUL bronchus arising directly from trachea).

title: "Medications affecting BP"
---
-meds for high BP affect it directly but others not for BP will affect it anyways - before doing BP or health history, ask patient if they are on meds for BP bc if you do a reading soon next to when they are due for their meds than that is the reason it is high 
-opioids and narcotics can lower BP
-cold meds and birth control can increase BP

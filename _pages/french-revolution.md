title: "French Revolution"
---
The revolution that began in 1789, overthrew the absolute monarchy of the Bourbons and the system of aristocratic privileges, and ended with Napoleon's overthrow of the Directory and seizure of power in 1799.

Massive dislocation of French
society (1789-1815) that overthrew the monarchy,
destroyed most of the French aristocracy, and
launched radical reforms of society that were lost
again, though only in part, under Napoleon's imperial
rule and after the restoration of the monarchy.

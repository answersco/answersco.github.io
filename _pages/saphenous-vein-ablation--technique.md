title: "Saphenous vein ablation: technique"
---
Either a long vascular sheath (laser) or the tx probe is inserted under US guidance.
-When treating GSV, the ablation device is advanced to within 1 cm (laser) or 2 cm (RFA) of saphenofemoral junction, and when treating the SSV to just proximal to the junction of the small saphenous and gastrocs veins.
-Tumescent anesthesia: critical step for thermal ablation, ensuring comfort, compressing vein against probe, and minimizing potential heat damage. Want &gt; 1 cm between skin and vein to be treated.
-Device then activated and withdrawn through the vein. Should never be activated in the CFV. Device turned off before withdrawing through soft tissues and skin to avoid burns. 
-CFV and pop veins then assessed with US for patency.
-Postprocedure pain and bruising reportedly less for higher wavelength lasers.

-can divide for self-renew and give rise to cancer cell, which in turn gives rise to abnormal daughter cells OR early progenitor cells can form normal cells or have mutations resulting in a tumor &amp; abnormal daughter cells
-this is important to find the cause of the cancer so you can find the specific cell bc the treatment given is specific to the genetic markers the cancer was found from and hope for better treatment this way

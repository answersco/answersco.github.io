Embolic material: usually PVA or embospheres for fibroids (targeting pre-capillary level), and gelfoam or glue for bleeding/post-partum hemorrhage. Can also be used for adenomyosis.

GnRH-releasing meds should be stopped for 3 months before procedure (they cause constriction of uterine artery)
Uterine artery: anterior division of internal iliac
Bilateral UAE usually necessary to prevent recruitment of new vessels.

Submucosal lesions and smaller tumors tend to have best response.
Cellular fibroids: high T2 signal- tend to respond well
Fibroids should have 40-60% reduction in volume after tx

Contraindications: pregnancy, active pelvic infection, prior pelvic XRT, connective tissue disease, prior surgery with adhesions (relative)

Complications:
5% with premature menopause
DVT/PE

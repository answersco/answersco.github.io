title: "Management of upper vs lower GI bleeding:"
---
GI bleeding: upper is proximal to ligament of Treitz, lower is distal to the ligament.
Acute UGI bleed: endoscopy is best initial procedure
Due to copious collaterals between the celiac axis and SMA, it is often reasonable to perform empirical embolization of the left gastric artery
Acute LGI bleed: stable patient should first undergo CTA or NM tagged-RBC study, as these are thought to be more sensitive than angiography.
Bleeding rate of 0.5-1.0 ml/min generally required to be angiographically positive.
Tagged RBC scan can detect bleeding rates as low as 0.2-0.4 ml/min
CTA: acute bleeding seen as extravasation&#8594; may detect rates as low as 0.35 ml/min
Lower GI collaterals are much less well developed than upper collaterals &#8594; significant risk of bowel infarct with indiscriminate lower GI embolization.
Intraarterial infusion of vasopressin (ADH) &#8594; can often control active LGI bleeding, but high rebleeding rate once infusion is stopped.
Vasopressin is most useful in cases of bleeding from antimesenteric vessels, which are more difficult to reach by catheter.
Major complications of vasopressin (in up to 20%): include arrhythmia, pulmonary edema, and HTN
Directly infused into SMA or IMA at dose of 0.2-0.4 units/min (100 units mixed in 500 ml saline given at 1 ml/min), given as constant infusion for up to 24 hours.
Can only be given for 24 hours before tachyphylaxis (lack of further response) develops.

TI can be chosen such that the tissue magnetic moment for a given type of tissue will be very small when the 90&#176; SE excitation occurs&#8594; so that type of tissue won't contribute signal (i.e. it will be suppressed)
STIR (short tau IR)
Fat signal (short T1) is suppressed using short TI
FLAIR (fluid attenuated IR) 
Long TI can be chosen to suppress fluid (CSF) &#8594; producing T2-weighted contrast, known as T2-FLAIR (AKA FLAIR)
TI can be chosen on the order of T1 for soft-tissue for producing T1 contrast = T1 FLAIR &#8594; thought to produce better T1 contrast images than traditional T1-weighted FSE images.

Compared to other tissue suppression techniques, IR is much less susceptible to magnetic field inhomogeneity and magnetic susceptibilities.

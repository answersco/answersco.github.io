title: "ROC analysis:"

ROC (receiver operating characteristic) analysis: 
ROC curve is a plot of test sensitivity (y axis) versus false positive rate (x-axis)
False positive rate = 1 - specificity
Defining test results as positive or negative requires choosing an appropriate cut point (determined by the clinical setting in which the test is used)
ROC curve is generated using the sensitivity and specificity values calculated at each different possible cut point, so that the ROC curve displays all possible cut points.
ROC curve is a good summary measure of test accuracy because it does not depend on disease prevalence or which cut point is chosen.

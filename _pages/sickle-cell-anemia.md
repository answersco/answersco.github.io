title: "Sickle cell anemia."
---
multiple pigment gallstones

-chronic condition
-almost inclusively seen in African-Americans
-because the RBC's are moon-shaped they do not carry oxygen as they are supposed to, leading to decreased oxygen
-they start to clump together in the veins eventually until its occluded causing blocked circulation and eventually start to experiencing pain and inflammation at the site which means they are in sickle cell crisis

1) one DNA base change in the &#946;-globin gene 
2) changes mRNA codon to code for Val (replaces Glu)
3) shape change causes aggregation of Hb molecules, resulting in
sickle shaped RBCs lodge in small vessels and rupture or clump up causing anemia, joint pain, and organ damage

-RBCs form crescent cells, passed down from families
-less oxygen carrying capacities since they are smaller than regular RBCs
-symptoms do not occur until baby is at least four months old
-almost all people have sickle cell crisis or excruciating episodes of pain usually in the long bones and chest area every few years
-could be hospitalized for blood transfusions, IV pain meds, and supplement folic acid bc it is important for manufacturing RBCs
-hydroxyurea is a drug that is used bc it helps prevent the cell from sickling and have to be on their entire lifespan
-bone marrow transplants is a cure but there has to be a good donor

Follow-up of pulmonary nodules: 
F/U not recommended for solitary nodule if &lt; 4mm and patient doesn't have significant risk factors
Interval growth is specific. 26% &#8593; in diameter is doubling in volume.
No change in size over 2 years is very likely, but not definitively benign.
F/U of ground-glass nodules (often indolent bronchioloalveolar carcinoma) may be appropriate beyond 2 years.
&#8595; in size of a suspicious nodule on a single follow-up study is not sufficient to establish a benign etiology.

title: "Antigen recognition and activation"
---
1) B-cell receptor binds to its specific antigen
-once binding occurs, B lymphocyte becomes activated
-activation often requires the help of certain T-lymphocytes (T-helper cells)

2) activated lymphocytes:
-divide to make more specific B-lymphocytes
-produced antibody specific to the antigen (Ab producing cell = plasma cell)

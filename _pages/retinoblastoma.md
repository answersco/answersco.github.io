title: "Retinoblastoma"
---
The constellation of findings in this case (calcified bilateral retinal lesions with a suprasellar mass and leptomeningeal metastases) has no alternate diagnosis; this is trilateral retinoblastoma with drop metastases.

Retinoblastoma&#8594; almost always &lt; 5 years old, presenting with leukocoria
Familial cases (p53 mutation) may be bilateral
Trilateral&#8594; bilateral Rb + pineoblastoma (quadrilateral includes suprasellar Rb)
Imaging: hyperattenuating, enhancing retinal mass with calcification in a normal-sized globe.

From neuroectoderm cells of retina
leukocoria
30% bilateral
extends along optic nerve; break through sclera
mets to liver, meninges, lymph nodes
90% calcifications
Trilateral: pineoblastoma

Ass'd with other malignancy: osteosarcoma most common

Calcifications are present in 90% of cases
This can be unilateral (sporadic) or bilateral (autosomal dominant - tumor supresor on chomosome 13), or trilateral, i.e, also with pineal gland involvement with a pineoblastoma (also thought to be AD)
On physical exam you can see &quot;leukocoria&quot; the white reflex

-a rare childhood eye tumor (white looking pupil in flash photography)
-inherited retinoblastoma requires two point mutations or deletions of tumor suppressor gene
-germline (shows up in both eyes) and somatic (environment, usually in one eye)
-study of RB was the origin of the &quot;two-hit&quot; hypothesis of cancer causation
-two mutations or deletions are required (one in each copy of the RB gene chromosome 13)
-the RB protein binds transcription factors so that they cannot activate genes that carry out mitosis (normally halts the cell cycle at G1)

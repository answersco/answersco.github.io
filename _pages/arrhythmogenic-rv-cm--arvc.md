Arrhythmogenic RV Cardiomyopathy (ARVC): familial CM where RV wall is progressively replaced by fibrosis and/or fat
Can lead to ventricular arrhythmias, sudden death, dilated RV, and right-sided heart failure
Cardiac MRI: primary modality to diagnose ARVC
Severe global or local dysfunction of RV (with no or only mild LV impairment)
Global RV dilatation
Localized RV or RVOT aneurysm
Fatty infiltration of RV myocardium&#8594; bright on T1, dark on fat-sat
May see DHE of RV&#8594; suggesting infiltration with fibrotic tissue

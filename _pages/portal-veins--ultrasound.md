title: "Portal veins (ultrasound)"
---
Velocity in a normal portal vein should be 20-40 cm/s and it should look like a gentle ungulation that is always above the baseline

Two patterns of abnormality:
1. Increased pulsatility: (essentially the same things that **** of hepatic vein waveforms with one added (cirrhosis)). Right sided heart failure, tricuspid regurgitation, and CIRRHOSIS (this is because the blood is pushing up against a cirrhotic liver)
2. Reversed: The bid one is portal HTN
3. Absent Flow: could be considered a fourth pattern and can be from tumor thrombosis vs bland thrombosis. 
4. Slow Flow: Velocities less than 15 cm/sec with portal hypertension being the most common cause. There are additional causes that can be lumped into their location: Pre - protal vein thrombosis, Intra: cirrhosis, Post: right sided heart failure, tricuspid regurg, budd-chiari

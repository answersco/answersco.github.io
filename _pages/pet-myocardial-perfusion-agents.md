Rubidium-82 &#8594; positron-emitting PET perfusion agent
Generated from strontium-82
Very short half life of 76 seconds &#8594; allows high doses to be administered, but precludes the use of exercise stress
Pharmacologic stress is used instead
Acts as a potassium analog (similar to thallium) &#8594; enters cells via active transport through the Na/K ATPase transmembrane pump.
Nitrogen-13 ammonia&#8594; positron-emitting PET perfusion agent (like Rb-82)
Half-life of 10 minutes
Cyclotron-produced (unlike Rb-82) &#8594; cyclotron must be on-site due to the short half-life
Excellent imaging characteristics
N-13 positrons have low kinetic energy and don't travel very far in tissue before annihilating&#8594; allows relatively high resolution.
Short half-life allows large doses to be given for high counts.
Short half-life&#8594; exercise stress is challenging
N-13 perfusion almost always coupled with pharmacologic stress.
F-18 PET&#8594; positron-emitting viability agent
Half-life of 110 minutes
Cannot be used for perfusion (unlike Rb-82 or N-13 ammonia)
F-18 FDG PET images&#8594; correlated with a sestamibi perfusion study to evaluate viability
Defect on sestamibi rest perfusion with discordant FDG uptake&#8594; represents viable hibernating myocardium that could potentially be revascularized.
Sestamibi perfusion defect with corresponding lack of F-18 FDG uptake = scar.
Which transmission line source is most commonly used to accomplish attenuation correction in myocardial perfusion scans using Tc-99m agents?
Gd-153

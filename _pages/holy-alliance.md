title: "Holy Alliance"
---
September 1815: An alliance between Prussia, Russia, and Austria in their conservative efforts to restrain liberalism, reform, and desire for national independence across Europe. They restored autocracy to Italian kingdoms and the Spanish monarchy. The Holy Alliance also held power in the new German Confederation, where they were able to squash reform and impose the Karlsbad Decrees of 1819.

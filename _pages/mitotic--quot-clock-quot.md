-tells cells how many times to divide (telomeres)
-telomeres are located at the ends of chromosomes
-contain hundreds to thousands of repeats of a 6-base DNA sequence (TTAGGG)
-most cells lose 50-200 endmost bases after each cell division
-after about 50 divisions, shortened telomeres signal the cell to stop dividing

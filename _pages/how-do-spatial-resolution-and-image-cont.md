title: "How do spatial resolution and image contrast compare between CT and x-ray radiography?"
---
CT has inferior spatial resolution and superior image contrast compared to radiography.
Contrast resolution for CT is 0.5%, and 5% for film-screen radiography.
The superior contrast resolution of CT is tied to its high SNR.

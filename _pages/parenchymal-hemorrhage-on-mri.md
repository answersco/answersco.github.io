Hyperacute (&lt; 24 hrs) = oxyhemoglobin, intracellular
-T1 iso, T2 bright

Acute (1-3 days) = deoxyhemoglobin (intracellular)
-T1 iso, T2 dark

Early subacute (&gt; 3 days) = methgb, intracellular
-T1 bright, T2 dark

Late subacute (&gt; 7 days) = methgmb, extracellular
-T1 bright, T2 bright

Chronic (&gt; 14 days) = ferritin and hemosiderin, extracellular.
-T1 dark, T2 dark peripherally; center may be T2 bright.

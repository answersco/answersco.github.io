Langerhans cell histiocytosis (eosinophilic granuloma)
CT&#8594; well-circumscribed destructive lesion, usually with nonsclerotic margins
MRI&#8594; soft-tissue masses surrounded by bone marrow and soft tissue edema, with marked enhancement.

Chondrosarcoma&#8594; characteristically arises in the midline from the clivus, or slightly off-midline from the petroclival synchondrosis.
CT&#8594; often shows a tumor with ring-and-arc chondroid matrix.
MRI&#8594; lobular, cauliflower-shaped, T2-hyperintense mass.

Chordoma&#8594; most commonly in clivus, and is often indistinguishable from chondrosarcoma (T2-hyperintense mass with bony destruction).

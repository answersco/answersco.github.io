title: "&quot;Practice-of-medicine&quot; doctrine:"
---
Refers to the ability of physicians to use drugs or devices in &quot;off-label&quot; manner. FDA, through this doctrine, gives physicians the authority to use drugs/devices &quot;for any condition or disease within a legitimate healthcare practitioner-patient relationship.&quot;
FDA regulates the marketing of drugs and devices, while individual states regulate their use by physicians.
Whereas a physician can use a drug off-label at his discretion, he is prohibited by FDA regulations from advertising its use.
In research-studies, devices without approval can only be used under an investigational device exemption (IDE), which must be approved by IRB.

title: "Integumentary system changes in the older adult"
---
-decreased subcutaneous fat, interstitial fluid, muscle tone, glandular activity, sensory receptors resulting in decreased protection against trauma, sun exposure, &amp; temperature extremes
-diminished secretion of natural oils, perspiration
-capillary fragility 


Functional consequence?
-skin turgor will tent, bruise easier, skin tears, pressure ulcers (takes older adults half as long to get one)

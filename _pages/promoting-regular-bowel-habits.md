1) timing: strong gastric choleric reflex more common in younger people - every time food hits the stomach and they have to go
-when do they have the urge to go and not putting off the urge to go
2) positioning: poop stool
3) privacy and dignity: sometimes they have two people in a room, have to keep them safe at the same time
4) nutrition/hydration: need to be hydrated bc large intestine absorbs water, fiber (toothpaste tube)

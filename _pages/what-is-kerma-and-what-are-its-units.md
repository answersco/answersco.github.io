title: "What is kerma and what are its units?"
---
KERMA = kinetic energy released per unit mass.
Energy transfer involves 2 steps:
-Energy transfer to charged particle (via Compton, PLE)
-Newly charged particle transfers energy to a medium via excitation and ionization
= kerma involves the first step only
-If you are dealing with a low energy photon, then kerma will be the same as absorbed dose
-If a high energy photon, kerma will be MORE than absorbed dose because some of these secondary electrons will escape the area of interest before depositing their energy. They will be counted in kerma, but not absorbed dose.

In general, tissue does are ~10% higher than air kerma
Kerma: SI unit is the Gy

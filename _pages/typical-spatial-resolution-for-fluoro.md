title: "Typical spatial resolution for fluoro:"
---
In general, the spatial resolution of the II alone is 3.5-6.0 lp/mm.
Improves with better TV systems that have more raster lines
Typical spatial resolution of most current FPD image receptors is 2.5-3.0 lp/mm for all FOVs
If there is binning for large FOV&#8594; spatial resolution degraded
Most FPD systems are limited by the detector element size (DEL) to about 2.5-3.0 lp/mm for GI studies
Most IIs have greater spatial resolution of about 3.5-6.0 lp/mm, which changes with FOV 
However the TV system limits the spatial resolution to about 1.0-2.0 lp/mm for 525 line GI fluoro systems and 2.0-4.0 lp/mm for 1023 line angio systems

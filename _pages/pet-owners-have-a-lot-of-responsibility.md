title: "Pet owners have a lot of responsibility."
---
Pets depend on their owners for many things. Pet owners must give their pets food, water, and shelter. Some pets, such as dogs, need attention from their owners every day. Pet owners must be careful so their pets do not run away or get injured. When a pet is ill or injured, its owner must take the pet to the vet.

title: "Free drug"
---
-not bound to protein, active and can cause a pharmacologic response
-drugs with high protein binding will have more drug interactions and drug will be released more slowly, will stay in system longer ---(free drug becomes available over longer time)
-can affect the next dose, drug interactions, and if acute kidney injury it will decrease excretion even further making the drug last even longer
-pts with low protein levels will have less protein binding sites and have more free drug available--- more toxicity possible and shorter duration of action

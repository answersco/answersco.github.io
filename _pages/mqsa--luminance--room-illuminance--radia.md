title: "MQSA: luminance, room illuminance, radiation output"
---
Luminance (brightness) of mammography viewbox must be &gt; 3000 cd/m2. 
Conventional viewboxes are ~ 1500 cd/m2
Maximum room illuminance should be &lt; 50 lux (low ambient light).
Radiation output:
System should be capable of producing a minimum output of 7.0 mGy air kerma per second (800 mR/s) when operating at 28 kVp in the standard (Mo/Mo) MM mode at any SID
Must maintain this output for at least 3 seconds

-Care must be taken during track dilatation such that guidewire doesn't kink at the GB entry site. If this isn't recognized, further dilatation or catheter placement may cause the guidewire to buckle at this site, resulting in guidewire flipping into peritoneal cavity. This happens more frequently with transperitoneal approach.
-If the guidewire kinks during track dilatation, the guidewire should be replaced by removing the kinked wire using the 5-Fr sheath and inserting a new 0.038-in J-guidewire or a stiffer wire such as a 0.038 Ring guidewire.

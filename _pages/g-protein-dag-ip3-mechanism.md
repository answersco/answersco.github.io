title: "G-protein DAG/IP3 mechanism"
---
-hormones include ADH, TRH, OT, LHRH
-Metabolic effects: smooth muscle contraction, protein synthesis, secretion, mitosis, etc

-Membrane receptors can alter metabolism through multiple second messenger systems causing varied effects
-Phospholipase enzmye splits a membrane phospholipid into DAG and IP3
-Diacylglycerol (diglyceride) activates a protein kinase, stimulates mitosis, proliferation, or metabolism
-Inositol triphosphate system increases Ca2+ and triggers rapid intracellular responses

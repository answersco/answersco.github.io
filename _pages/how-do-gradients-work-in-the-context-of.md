title: "How do gradients work in the context of the Larmor equation?"
---
In the context of MRI&#8594; a gradient is a magnetic field that varies spatially
Applied to Larmor Equation:
The main field of an MRI scanner is very uniform&#8594; w is uniform
Turning on gradients changes B
Gradients vary spatially&#8594; B varies spatially&#8594; w varies spatially

To form an image, one must be able to identify where tissue is within the scanner.
Solution: label magnetic moments by position, using gradients.
Turning on the magnetic gradient alters the resonant frequency spatially.

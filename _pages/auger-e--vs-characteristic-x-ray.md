title: "Auger e-(vs Characteristic X-ray)"
---
When a vacancy in an inner shell is created (by incoming e- or photon), an outer shell e- promptly fills the vacancy. The energy may appear as an Auger e- (or characteristic x-ray). If the released energy from the e- transition between shells is imparted directly to another orbital e- and makes it free, it is called an Auger e-. Heavy elements are more likely to emit x-rays, while light elements more likely to emit Auger e-.

In this case, the atom is left doubly ionized and the Auger e- leaves the atom with significant kinetic energy, resulting in local dose deposition.

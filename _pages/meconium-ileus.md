title: "Meconium Ileus"
---
Best diagnostic clue
Distal bowel obstruction with microcolon + meconium-filled terminal ileum (TI) on enema
Size
Microcolon (small unused colon due to impaired passage of succus entericus from small to large bowel); proximal small bowel is dilated

presenting symptom in 10%
cystic fibrosis
marked distention of the small bowel and a &quot;soap bubble&quot; appearance in the right side of the abdomen (arrows), a finding suggestive of mottled air and feces.

Meconium ileus &#8594; from inspissated meconium in distal ileum and colon
May be complicated by perforation and resultant meconium peritonitis, which can cause abdominal and scrotal calcifications.
Classic appearance: distal obstruction with soap-bubble lucencies in RLQ.
Contrast enema: microcolon with distended ileum containing multiple rounded filling defects.
Diagnosed and treated with therapeutic water-soluble gastrografin enema, often requiring multiple attempts.
Meconium plug syndrome does not cause microcolon.

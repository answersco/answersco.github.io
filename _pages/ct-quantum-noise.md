title: "CT quantum noise"
---
Quantum noise (&#963;) &#8594; directly dependent on the # of x-ray photons (N) used to make the clinical image
For an x-ray photon flux: &#963; = &#8730;N
As the # of x-ray photons doubles, the signal &#8593; by a factor of 2, while the noise &#8593; by a factor of &#8730;2
However, what is visually perceived as noise by a human observer of an image is the relative noise (&#963;/N)
When N doubles, the relative noise in the image &#8595; by a factor of &#8730;2 (&#963;/N = &#8730;2/2 = 1/&#8730;2) &#8594; leading to improved contrast resolution and greater visibility of low-contrast objects.

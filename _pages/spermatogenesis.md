title: "Spermatogenesis"
---
-4 gametes are produced that can potentially contribute to a zygote
-a mitochondria-containing midpiece must be present in mature cells
-an acrosomal region must be present in mature cells

-spermatocytes divide by meiosis to produce four equal sized haploid spermatids that mature into four sperm
-occurs in seminiferous tubules of testes
1) start at spermatogonium (2n = 46 single chromosomes)
2) primary spermatocyte (4n = 46 double chromosomes b/c duplicated chromosomes during S phase)
3) 2 secondary spermatocytes (2n = 23 double chromosomes, reduction)
4) 4 spermatids (1n = 23 single chromosomes, equational)

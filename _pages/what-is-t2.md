title: "What is T2?"
---
RF pulse causes protons to synch up and precess in phase, establishing transverse magnetization. With time these gradually fall out of synch = T2 transverse relaxation
T2 = decay of transverse magnetization- exponential curve with negative slope.
-T2 shorter than T1 (takes less time to go down a hill).
T2 = time at which 37% of original transverse magnetization has decayed.
AKA spin-spin relaxation

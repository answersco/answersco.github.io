title: "If mosaic attenuation, how to differentiate small airway disease from pulmonary vascular disease?"
---
Expiratory imaging - will show air trapping in small airway disease and not with pulmonary vascular disease. Infiltrating lung disease is also in the differential, but that will show ground glass opacities. Low attenuating areas are abnormal in pulm vascular disease and small airway disease. In diffuse infiltrating disease, the low attenuating areas are the normal lung (high attenuation is the ground glass areas).

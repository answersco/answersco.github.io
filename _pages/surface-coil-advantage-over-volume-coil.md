title: "Surface coil advantage over volume coil?"
---
Surface coils are placed next to the area of interest (e.g.,spine coils are built into the scanner table, shoulder coils, or TMJ coils). They have the benefit of higher SNR close to the coil than a volume coil.

But, they have inhomogeneous signal (signal drop-off with increasing distance from the coil).

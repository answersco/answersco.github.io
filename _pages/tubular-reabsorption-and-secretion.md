title: "Tubular reabsorption and secretion"
---
-potassium, magnesium, and phosphate ions diffuse through the paracellular route with water
-phosphate is also cotransported into the epithelial cells with Na+ 
-some calcium is reabsorbed through the paracellular route in the PCT, but most Ca2+ reabsorption occurs later in the nephron
-mostly H+, urea, uric acid, ammonia are secreted, along with some anions. 
-K+ can be secreted under certain circumstances
-drugs are secreted

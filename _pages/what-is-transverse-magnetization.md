title: "What is transverse magnetization?"
---
Loss of synchronous precession is tissue specific&#8594; called T2 relaxation.
T2 relaxation time &#8594; defined as the time for the for the transverse magnetization vector (MXY) to &#8595; 63% or the time for the transverse vector to &#8595; to 37% of its original value.
The net transverse magnetization occurs only when the population of protons is exposed to radio-waves of the same frequency.

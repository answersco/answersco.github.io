-Monochorionic
-Donor twin = small, oligohydramnios, stuck to wall of uterus
-Recipient twin = big, polyhydramnios

This is going to happen when you have a MONOchorion, i.e., they have a shared placenta

In some pregnancies there can be a crossed blood channel where one twin saps the blood from the other

The SKINNY twin (less blood flow) does better, and the fat twin typically gets fetal hydrops and dies

In the skinny twin, you will see oligohydramnios and high resistive index in the umbilical artery. The small twin looks like it is shrink wrapped to the amiontic sac whereas the big twin has POLYhydramnios

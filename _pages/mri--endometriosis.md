Endometriosis: ectopic foci of hormonally-responsive endometrial tissue&#8594; therefore may be composed of blood products of varying ages
Imaging: typical appearance is multiple hyperintense masses on T1WI that demonstrate shading (a gradient of signal intensity) on T2WI.
Does not suppress on FS sequences
Less commonly appears as hyperintense on T1 and T2.
Tiny hemorrhagic endometrial implants may only be apparent as tiny hyperintense foci on T1WI.
Ruptured endometrioma: may produce free fluid that is hyperintense on T1 and T2WI.

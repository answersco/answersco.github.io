title: "Normal and variant anatomy of hepatic veins"
---
The largest of the HVs exit the posterosuperior surface of the liver and join the hepatic segment of the IVC just before it leaves the abdomen.

Left hepatic vein: oriented anteriorly
Middle hepatic vein: oriented anterolaterally
Right hepatic vein: lateral or posterolateral orientation

Middle and left HVs form a common trunk before joining IVC in 65-85%.
A second lower group of HVs arising from the caudate and right lobes are also present and vary in number.
Large-caliber veins from the lower right lobe (inferior right HVs) are seen in 15%.

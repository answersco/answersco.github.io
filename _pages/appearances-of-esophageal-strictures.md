title: "Appearances of esophageal strictures:"
---
Peptic stricture: due to chronic reflux
Located distally, usually just above the GEJ
May be focal or involve a longer segment of esophagus
Fibrosis can cause esophageal shortening&#8594; leads to hiatal hernia as stomach is pulled into thorax

Barrett esophagus stricture: mid-esophagus (above metaplastic transition)
Occur higher than peptic strictures because adenomatous tissue is acid-resistant

Malignant stricture: shouldered margins&#8594; suggests circumferential luminal narrowing by a mass

Caustic stricture/NG tube stricture: typically long, smooth, and narrow
Develop 1-3 months after caustic ingestion or NG tube placement
Usually longer than peptic strictures

Radiation stricture: long, smooth, and narrow, similar to caustic strictures
In contrast to NG/caustic strictures, XRT strictures usually spare the GEJ
Generally requires &gt; 50 Gy to cause stricture
Acute radiation esophagitis: occurs 1-4 weeks after therapy
Strictures: develop later, 4-8 months after therapy

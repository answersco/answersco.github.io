title: "What technique is used for quantifying blood flow in cardiac MRI?"
---
Velocity encoded GRE (VENC), AKA phase-contrast imaging &#8594; used for quantifying flowing blood
Measures the phase shift that occurs as protons in blood move through a magnetic field &#8594; can obtain the velocity and direction of blood flow
To obtain accurate measurements from VENC image, a plane must be selected that is perpendicular to the path of flowing blood
Creates a velocity-encoded image for multiple phases of the heart cycle &#8594; creates a cine clip
Cine clip: 
Stationary tissue appears gray
Tissue moving through the plane appears as shades of white or black, depending on direction.
The more white or black the tissue, the faster it is moving
Software used to quantify blood flow and create time-velocity or time-flow curves
VENC is valuable for evaluating stenoses:
Can calculate a pressure gradient across a lesion from the blood velocities
Can be used to determine relative flows in the systemic and pulmonary systems when evaluating a cardiac shunt, determine pressure gradient across a stenotic valve, or regurgitant flow through a valve

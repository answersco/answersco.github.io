title: "Electronic magnification (in depth)"

See images for deep dive

Big time points:

1. When you make you FOV smaller (rememebr this is not columnation) you minify LESS which MAGNIFIES the image
&#8212;Dose is going to INCREASE
&#8212;Minifying something less means minification LOSS which means the image will be LESS bright unless the ABC cranks up the mAs

2. Electronic mag INCREASES the air kerma (and therefore the skin dose) Why? You increased the number of photons and you focused it over a smaller spot

3. Electronic mag DOES NOT increase the KAP. This is because even though you have increased the juice you DECREASED the cross sectional area of the beam therefore they NULLIFY.

MSB: extraction of superficial venous segments through small incisions using hooked tools and local anesthetic.
-Alternative to sclerotherapy for moderate and large varicosities, and even superficial segments of GSV
-Advantages: removal of the abnormal vein segment, which reduces the pigmentation, palpable cords, and recanalization sometimes seen after sclero of large varices.
-Disadvantages: multiple incision, higher risk of superficial nerve injury (esp around ankle), and greater time required to perform procedure.
-Generally not used to treat varicosities of the foot or those directly over anterior surface of tibia.

title: "Cervical Hyperflexion-Rotation Injury"
---
Best diagnostic clue
Asymmetric hyperextension pattern of injury to posterior column
Location
Below C2; most common at C6 and C7
Fracture of articular facet
Simple fracture or impacted/comminuted
Fracture of superior articular facet more commonly associated with radiculopathy
Fracture of articular pillar
Simple fracture or impacted/comminuted
May extend into lamina
Simultaneous fractures of pedicle and ipsilateral lamina = traumatic isolation of cervical articular pillar
Unstable injury
May see degree of rotational deformity at level of injury

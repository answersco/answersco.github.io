-Improves oxygen-carrying capacity 

-Provides the same oxygen-carrying capacity as whole blood without the additional volume

-Used for transfusion 00 need to be ABO compatible

-Looking at antibodies called IgM pt will have that could fight against blood transfusion that will cause a major reaction 

-Volume: 250-350 mL, usually 300 mL with 1 unit raises Hgb 1 g &amp; Hct 3-4%

-Advantages over whole blood:
1) Decrease plasma volume
2) Less citrate, potassium, ammonia, &amp; other metabolic byproducts
**-those with HF history need monitored closely b/c giving them a lot of fluids that could throw them into HF -- may be given a dose of furosemide between each unit of blood

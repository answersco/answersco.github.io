title: "Pulmonary vs mediatsinal masses"

See if there are air bronchograms. If it is EXTRApulmonary, then there will NOT be air bronchograms because it PUSHES the lung away

Also look at the angle between the lung border. IF it's acute, then it's within the lung. If its obtuse, it's mediatstinal. This is the same thing as the claw sign.

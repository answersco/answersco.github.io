title: "IMPORTANT: In MRI, if you increase the voxel, how does it affect signal intensity and noise?"
---
Signal intensity INCREASES

* NOISE is INDEPENDENT of the voxel size, so it doesn't change! (noise depends on rBW and RF coil characteristics)

* Important: in CT, when you increase signal, you automatically DECREASE noise (mottle)

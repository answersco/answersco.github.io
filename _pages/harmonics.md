title: "Harmonics"
---
This is distortion that you get due to the frequency of the soundwave changing as it passes through the body
Basically you can fix this by making the receiver EMIT and RECEIVE different harmonics (i.e. it is basically attuned to the ****ed up frequency coming back)
Harmonics are NOT produced in the near field
This process improves LATERAL resolution 
There is a REDUCTION in reverberation artifact 
Because you are dealing with higher frequencies, you do lose some depth

Transmit at one frequency and receive in another. Improves LATERAL resolution. Needs to travel a certain distance before you get this.

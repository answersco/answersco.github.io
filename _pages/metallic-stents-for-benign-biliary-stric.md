title: "Metallic stents for benign biliary strictures"
---
Metallic stents should be used as a last resort when benign biliary strictures fail to respond to balloon dilatation
-Authors (Requisites) perform at least 3 separate dilatation procedures before resorting to metallic stenting.
-For young patients, surgical revision may be best option after failed PTA. Stenting may be appropriate for older patients.
-If it is decided to place metallic stent, then a Gianturco-Rosch stent should be placed rather than a Wallstent. The Gianturco-Rosch stent exerts a stronger radial force and presents a lesser surface area for development of intimal hyperplasia. It is thus the preferred stent for dealing with recalcitrant biliary strictures.

Failure to form:
- Soup is only on one side, i.e., you will have ABSENCE of one kidney and a UNICORNUATE uterus (+/- rudimentary horn)

Failure to fuse:
- Complete failure to fuse = uterine didelphys
- Partial failure to fuse = Bicornuate uterus
*<b>NOTE</b>* BOTH of these pathologies are going to get a septate vagina 

Failure to cleave:
- Septate uterus (basically there is a septum that runs though the uterus)

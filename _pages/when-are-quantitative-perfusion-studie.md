title: "- when are quantitative perfusion studies performed? (2) - use Xenon or Tc-DTPA for the vent portion?"
---
- prior to lung resection or lung transplant
( wanto make sure that one lung can hold its own)
- use combined Xenon and Tc-MAA because the Xe wont interfere with the energy of Tc (Tc-DTPA energy will interfere with Tc-MAA)

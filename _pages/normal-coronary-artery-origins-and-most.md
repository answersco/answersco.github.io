title: "Normal coronary artery origins and most common coronary origin anomaly"
---
Most commonly 2 coronary artery origins off the proximal aorta at the sinuses of Valsalva. 
The most common anomaly is a high takeoff from the sinotubular junction or above.
3 coronary sinuses.
RCA: arises from right coronary sinus (located anterior)
L main coronary artery arises from left coronary sinus (left-posterior), and courses between the PA and LAA.
Normally no coronary artery arises from noncoronary sinus (right-posterior)

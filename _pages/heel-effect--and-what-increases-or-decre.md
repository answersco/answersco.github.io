title: "Heel effect, and what increases or decreases it; effect on FOV"
---
Because x-rays at anode side have to pass through a greater thickness of the anode, there is a reduction in the intensity of these x-rays
Heel effect can be &#8595; by &#8593; the anode angle or &#8595; the size of the x-ray field
Used in MM where the thicker part of the breast/chest wall are aligned with the cathode

Heel effect worse with:
Small anode angle
Decreased SID
Increased FOV/field size

Heel effect on FOV:
Because the energy &#8595; on the anode side, this also &#8595; the FOV on that side (the side of the nipple)
To compensate for this, the entire tube is angled up to 20 degrees
Effective anode angle = sum of anode and tube angles

Inguinal hernia: 
Indirect: neck of hernia is lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels
Hernia contents travel with spermatic cord, often into the scrotum
Direct: neck of hernia is medial to the inferior epigastric vessels due to weak area in anterior abdominal wall
Hernia contents do not go into scrotum

Obturator hernia: through the obturator canal, almost always in elderly women due to pelvic floor laxity
Key finding: bowel located between the pectineus and obturator muscles

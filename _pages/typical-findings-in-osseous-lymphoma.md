The lesion is lytic with permeative bone destruction and no true matrix. 
Periosteal reaction is present in approximately 60% of cases. 
Cortical destruction is often subtle, if at all visible, radiographically. 
A soft tissue mass is characteristic, and it may be small or disproportionately large.

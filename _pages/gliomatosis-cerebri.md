title: "Gliomatosis cerebri"
---
Rare neoplastic infiltration of at least three lobes of the brain. Poor prognosis. Diffuse involvement of cerebral white matter with or without a mass.

Diffuse infiltrative 
Two + lobes
T2 prolongation
No mass
Degen to gbm
Gr 2-3

Rare; infiltrative malignancy
-expansion of WM (can involve cortex)
-nonenhancing
-leptomeningeal gliomatosis = marked enhancement

DDX:
lymphomatosis cerebri
multicentric glioma
viral encephalitis
vasculitis
ADEM

Has to affect at least 3 lobes
Low grade so it does not enhance
Note in the image that you CAN tell that the left hemisphere has been expanded

-astrocytoma involving 2 or more lobes + extra-cortical involvement (basal ganglia, corpus callous, brainstem, cerebellum)
-T2 hyperintensity
-NO ENHANCEMENT
-can degenerate into GBM
-exerts mass effect

title: "What cystic lung disease spares the costophrenic angles?"
---
LCH (HST pneumonitis also spares costophrenic angles)
Smokers in 20s-30s, with 50% spontaneously resolving
Starts out with centrilobular nodules with upper lobe predominance.
Nodules eventually cavitate into cysts, which are thin walled, but become more thick walled, and ultimately &quot;bizarre-shaped.&quot;
Late disease is primarily cysts.

Assessment for cerebrovascular reserve by first giving acetazolamide (diamox, a vasodilator) followed by a perfusion tracer.
Normal: should get 3-4x increase in perfusion

Areas that have already maxed out their autoregulatory vasodilation (at risk for ischemia) will appear relatively hypointense - may benefit from revascularization therapy.

title: "Brightness gain, and the type of gain that worsens with age of II"
---
Brightness gain: describes the increase in emitted light from the II compared to that without an II
Due to the combined effects of flux gain and minification gain
BG = flux gain x minification gain

Conversion gain (Gx): describes the efficiency of an II in changing incident x-rays into light at the output surface
The older the II, the worse the conversion gain.

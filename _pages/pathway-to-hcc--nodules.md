title: "Pathway to HCC: nodules"
---
Regenerative nodule: completely supplied by PV, and not premalignant
Should NOT enhance in arterial phase
Most show long signal on T2, with variably signal intensity on T1
Rarely may be hyperintense on T1W imaging, due to glycogen deposition.
MRI C+: most regenerative nodules enhance to the same (or slightly less) degree as adjacent hepatic parenchyma.

Dysplastic nodules: these are premalignant (unlike regenerative nodules)
Most do not demonstrate arterial phase enhancement (unless high-grade) since blood supply is still from the PV
Variably SI on T1W images, and typically hypointense on T2, although high-grade dysplastic nodules may be T2-hyperintense
MRI C+: most low-grade dysplastic nodules are iso-enhancing relative to liver, and thus indistinguishable from regenerative nodules.
High-grade dysplastic nodules may demonstrate arterial enhancement &#8594; indistinguishable from well-differentiated HCC

Siderotic nodule: iron-rich regenerative or dysplastic nodule; rarely, if ever, malignant
Hypointense on T1 and T2*-weighted images
Hyperattenuating on CT.

title: "Mammo Basics (Accentuating DIFFERENCES between this and normal radiography)"
---
Attenuation between breast tissue (normal) and cancer (abnormal) is very small
You HAVE to use LOW KvP to accentuate these differences (typically 25-30 kVp)
ANODE (target) is NOT tungsten, instead it is either MOLYbdenum or RHODIUM...So why is this: remember characteristic xrays are formed for different substances, for moly and rho the characteristic xrays are around keV of 16-23 VERSUS 69.5 keV for conventional 

How do we get the beam to be extremely uniform?
- FILTERS: use a moly filter (k-edge 20 keV) therefore everything BELOW 15 or ABOVE 20 gets filtered

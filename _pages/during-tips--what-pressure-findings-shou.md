title: "During TIPS: what pressure findings should lead you to stop the case; what is target portosystemic gradient?"
---
First part of TIPS: measure right heart pressure.
Elevated right heart pressure (10-12 mmHg) is a contraindication to TIPS (normal is ~ 5 mmHg).

Post procedure PSG: target gradient ~9-12
Dropping the gradient too low increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy- may need to be tightened with second stent.

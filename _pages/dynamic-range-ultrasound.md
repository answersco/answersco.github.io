title: "Dynamic range ultrasound"

The dynamic range is the ratio of the LAREST to the SMALLEST echoes that a scanner can respond to

The HIGHER the dynamic range, the SMOOTHER the image appears

The LOWER the dynamic range, the MORE CONTRAST the image has 

think of dynamic range like this: if you are able to detect more frequencies then things will look more smooth.

---
1) early cartilage model that include just the hyaline cartilage surrounded by the perichondrium
2) formation of primary ossification center and periosteum -- chondrocytes included
3) formation of primary marrow cavity and secondary ossification center; osteoclasts digest calcified tissue in center of bone, leaving osteoblasts to line the cavity; vascular invasion
4) birth; enlarged primary marrow cavity and secondary marrow cavity in one epiphysis; metaphysis formed
5) child; growth at epiphyseal plate
6) adult; single marrow cavity and closed epiphyseal plate

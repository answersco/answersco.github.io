title: "Olympe de Gouges"
---
A proponent of democracy and equality, this female journalist demanded the same rights for French women that French men were demanding for themselves. In her &quot;Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen&quot; (1791), she challenged the practice of male authority and the notion of male-female inequality. She lost her life to the guillotine due to her revolutionary ideas.

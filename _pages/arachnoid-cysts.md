Are intra-arachnoidal. 50% occur in middle cranial fossa. Other sites: Frontal convexity. Suprasellar and quadrigeminal cisterns. Posterior fossa. Follow CSF signal and density. May remodel adjacent bone. Do not restrict diffusion. Enlarged cisterna magna fills immediately at cisternography; whereas, arachnoid cyst may not fill or slowly fill.

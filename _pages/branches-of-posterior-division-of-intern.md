Lateral sacral, iliolumbar, superior gluteal

Iliolumbar, lateral sacral, superior gluteal

Iliolumbar: usually 1st branch, though it may arise from proximal IIA or rarely CIA. It courses superiorly along SI joint, and usually anastomoses with the lowest lumbar artery.

Superior gluteal: usually largest branch of posterior division. It exits the bony pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen, superior to the piriformis muscle.

Lateral sacral: named for their origins relative to the sacrum. These are small, and often multiple. They travel medially toward the sacrum, with anastomoses with the median sacral artery and the opposite lateral sacral vessels.

Precapillary:
Vascular
 increased flow: L-R shunts
 chronic PE
 vasculitis, drugs, idiopathic
Pulmonary
 emphysema
 interstitial fibrosis
 fibrothorax, chest wall deformities
 alveolar hypoventilation

Postcapillary:
Cardiac:
 LV failure
 Mitral stenosis
 LA myxoma
Pulmonary venous
 idiopathic venoocclusive disease
 thrombosis
 tumor

Diffusely heterogeneous perfusion with many small perfusion abnormalities (this case due to chronic pe)

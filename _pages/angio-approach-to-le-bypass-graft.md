If femoral access can't be obtained, axillary, radial, or translumbar puncture may be required.
-Surgical anastomoses frequently have a flared appearance (&quot;the hood&quot; of the graft) related to the manner in which the graft is attached to the native vessel
-Proximal anastomosis is usually on the anterior wall of the vessel when the origin is the CFA, PFA, or SFA. Filming in steep anterior oblique may be necessary for visualization.
-Distal anastomoses vary in orientation depending on the target vessel. Course of graft may be similar to native artery or extraanatomic.

Severe stenosis in mid or distal portion of graft: contrast injected proximal to graft may not opacify the stagnant column of blood in the graft.
-This &quot;pseudo-occlusion&quot; should be suspected when a definite meniscus isn't seen at the origin of the graft or when a pulse is known to be present in the nonvisualized bypass. Selective injection of graft necessary.

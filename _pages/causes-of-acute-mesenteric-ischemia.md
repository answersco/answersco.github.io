-Embolus (cardiac or aortic source).
-Thrombosis of existing atherosclerotic lesion
-Dissection (aortic or localized to visceral artery)
-Cholesterol embolization
-Vasculitis
-Iatrogenic (eg low placement of IABP)
-Mesenteric venous thrombosis
-Low-flow state (nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia). Commonly on multiple vasopressors or digitalis, or cardiogenic shock or sepsis. Angio characteristically shows vasoconstriction of SMA and branches with common interposed areas of normal caliber vessels. Injection of vasodilator directly into SMA (eg NG) can be diagnostic and therapeutic. Direct injection of Papaverine (0.5-1 mg/min) can be used to treat spasm until patient stabilizes.

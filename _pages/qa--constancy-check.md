title: "QA: Constancy check?"

Constancy: Performed daily. To ensure the stability of calibrator's precision. A sealed certified (preferably Cs-137) long-lived source is measured with the dose calibrator, and the time-decay corrected measurement is compared with the ones of previous days. The measurements must not differ more than &#177;5%.

title: "Where is the IR reference point?"
---
The Interventional Reference Point is located, 15 cm closer to the x-ray tube focus from the system isocenter. It is the best indicator of the location of the patient's skin (but not a very good one in practice, and may overestimate or underestimate the &quot;true&quot; patient skin dose).

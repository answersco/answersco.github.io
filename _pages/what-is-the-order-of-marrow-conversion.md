title: "What is the order of marrow conversion?"
---
Red marrow converts to yellow marrow in the following order:
Epiphysis and apophysis, diaphysis, and lastly the metaphysis.
Conversion begins in distal extremities and progresses proximally.
By 20-25 years, the appendicular skeleton is mostly fatty marrow, except the proximal metaphyses of the humerus and femur, which may retain red marrow.

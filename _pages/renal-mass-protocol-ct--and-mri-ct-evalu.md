title: "Renal mass protocol CT, and MRI/CT evaluation of enhancement"
---
Renal mass protocol CT:
Unenhanced phase: necessary to quantify enhancement
Nephrographic phase (100 second delay)
Pyelographic phase (15 minute delay)

Evaluating enhancement:
CT: enhancement quantified as the absolute &#8593; in HU on post-contrast compared to pre-contrast
&lt;10 HU: no enhancement
10-19 HU: equivocal enhancement
&gt; 20 HU: enhancement
MRI: quantified as the % &#8593; in signal intensity as measured on post-contrast images
&lt;15%: no enhancement
15-19%: equivocal enhancement
&gt; 20%: enhancement

Lesions are considered too small to characterize if the lesion diameter is smaller than twice the slice thickness

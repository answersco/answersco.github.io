This is going to be in the case of PARTIAL RESPONSE
This can be seen as progressive sclerosis of a previously seen lytic lesion with a sclerotic border (the important finding is that the lesion has not become more destructive - REMEMBER to look at the characteristics of the initial lesion,i.e., is it lytic)

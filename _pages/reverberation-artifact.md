title: "Reverberation artifact?"

Reverberation is the result of a strong reflector eliciting multiple reflections that are so strong that they show up repeatedly and confuse the system display. The result is that these multiple echoes are placed beneath the reflecting surface and are placed at equal separations within a structure (about the distance equal to the reflector and the transducer)

Violates the principle of one sound wave is sent out and comes back in
This is when you have multiple highly reflective structures adjacent to each other

Due to reflections between two parallel highly reflective surfaces. Looks like multiple equidistantly spaced linear reflections

title: "What determines slice thickness in MRI?"
---
Slice thickness: manipulated by adjusting the bandwidth of the selective pulse and the amplitude of the slice-selection gradient (SSG, applied at same time as initial 90 degree RF pulse).
Slice thickness = transmitted RF bandwidth (SSG x constant).

Increasing transmit RF bandwidth and decreasing SSG gives thicker slices.
Using narrower RF pulse bandwidth takes longer to excite, so thinner slices = longer study

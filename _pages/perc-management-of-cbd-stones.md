title: "Perc management of CBD stones"
---
ERCP may be unsuccessful in removing stones due to previous gastric surgery, a large diverticulum at the ampulla of Vater, or other technical problems.
-If ERCP is unsuccessful, a rendezvous procedure can be used to remove or manage CBD stones.
-Standard biliary drainage is performed and an internal/external biliary drainage catheter is left in the duodenum. After 1-2 days, ERCP is performed to permit access for endoscopic bile duct cannulation and stone removal.

If rendezvous procedure isn't possible due to altered upper GI anatomy, alternatives include open surgical or transhepatic removal of CBD stones.
-Transhepatic approach can be used to perform a sphincteroplasty by inflating a 10-mm balloon across the sphincter of Oddi and pushing small stones into the duodenum with a semi-inflated balloon.
-Transhepatic stone removal is rarely performed because it requires a mature tract through the liver. This involves initial PTC and sequential tract dilatation, followed by basket extraction of stones or mechanical lithotripsy.

title: "How is standard MRI of the shoulder obtained, and what is evaluated with ABER?"

Regular MRI: arm adducted (by the side) with shoulder in external rotation (thumb pointing lateral).
-If the MRI is obtained in internal rotation, there is poor evaluation of the subscapularis and biceps tendon.

ABER = abduction and external rotation
-To evaluate the integrity of the glenohumeral ligament and inferior labrum.
-Patient is supine with shoulder abducted and hand below the posterior neck.

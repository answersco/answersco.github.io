title: "What is flux gain?"
---
High voltage power supply accelerates the electrons emitted from the photocathode imparting greater kinetic energy by the time they reach the output phosphor.
Brightness gain = minification gain x flux gain. Affects light ratio to photons.

The number of light photons emitted from the output phosphor compared to the nimber of light photons produced in the input phosphor

Hepatopulmonary syndrome: occurs in cirrhotics, and includes dilated basilar lung vessels, peripheral telangiectasias, and arteriovenous communications.

70% of pulmonary AVMs occur as part of an AD disorder: either HHT or Osler-Weber-Rendu

HHT patients have recurrent epistaxis, skin telangiectasias, and AVMs in liver, brain or spine in many patients.

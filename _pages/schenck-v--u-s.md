1st amendment does not protect against anti war protest during formal war, &quot;clear and present danger doctrine&quot;.

(1919) Unanimously upheld the Espionage Act of 1917 which declared that people who interfered with the war effort were subject to imprisonment; declared that the 1st Amendment right to freedom of speech was not absolute, as free speech could be limited if its exercise presented a &quot;clear and present danger.&quot;

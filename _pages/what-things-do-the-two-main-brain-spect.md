title: "What things do the two main brain SPECT tracers (HMPAO and ECD) have in common? (2) - what is different about them?"
---
Common:
- neutral and lipophilic
- accumulate in the cortex proportional to blood flow (gray matter &gt; white matter)

Differences:
- HMPAO washout is fat (&quot;humpin it&quot; - HMPao)
- ECD washout is slow (more rapid clearance from blood pool

- HMPAO favors frontal lobe, thalamus, and cerebellum
- ECD favors parietal and occipital

** makes direct comparison between HMPAO and ECD difficult

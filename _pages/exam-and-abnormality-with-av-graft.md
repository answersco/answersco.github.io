title: "Exam and abnormality with AV graft"
---
Most common site of obstruction is at the venous outflow (usually at or just distal to the graft-to-vein anastomosis), usually secondary to intimal hyperplasia.

Exam: should be a thrill at the arterial anastomosis
Bruit should be audible throughout the graft
High-pitched bruit = stenosis
Low-pitched bruit = normal

Swollen arm and chest = central venous stenosis

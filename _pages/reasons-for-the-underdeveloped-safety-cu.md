title: "Reasons for the underdeveloped safety culture in healthcare; measurement of safety culture; and ways to improve it"
---
Underlying reasons for the underdeveloped healthcare safety culture are complex, and include poor teamwork and communication, a &quot;culture of low expectations,&quot; and authority gradients.
Organizations with steep authority gradients: especially where there is fear of punishment for errors, quality and safety problems are rarely reported to senior leadership &#8594; undermines the safety culture.

Measurement: 
Safety culture is generally measured by surveys of providers at all levels
Validated surveys include: the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Patient Safety Culture Surveys and the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire. 

Improvement in Safety Culture:
Executive walkarounds
Establishing unit-based safety teams
Teamwork systems (e.g. TeamSTEPPS): advocate wide implementation of rapid response teams and structured communication methods like Situation Background Assessment Recommendation (SBAR) to help address cultural issues such as rigid hierarchies and communication problems.

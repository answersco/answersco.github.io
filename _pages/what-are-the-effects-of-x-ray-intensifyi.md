title: "What are the effects of x-ray intensifying screen speed and thickness on blur, spatial resolution, and absorption efficiency?"
---
Increasing screen thickness increases screen speed
Faster speed screens require lower air kerma values of the incident x-ray beam
Fast screen films are used for abdominal imaging, while slow screen films are used for extremity imaging
Faster screens &#8593; blur

The thicker the screen, the greater the blur effect
Shorter exposure times (as can be obtained with thicker screens with higher absorption efficiency) &#8595; the effect of patient motion and result in improved spatial resolution 
The use of screens &#8595; spatial resolution due to the diffusion of photons within the screen

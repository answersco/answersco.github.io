title: "Obstructive sleep apnea"
---
-most common kind
-tongue pushes back against throat and closes airway
-frequent (100 or more) mini arousals all night
-decreased slow wave sleep and decreased REM from mini arousals
-hypoxia is reason for arousals
-mini arousals can cause spike in HR and BP bc SNS takes over
-strongly linked to CV disease, HTN, stroke, MI, and cognitive deficits (memory impairment, impaired concentration)
-often associated with obesity but it is not a cause of i
-complain of excessive sleepiness or fatigue, wake up in the morning feeling tired, have difficulty concentrating and poor memory, looks like depression symptoms
-public safety issue bc could be increase in motor vehicle accidents
-common treatment is CPAP during bedtime - 46-83% non-compliance but lack of using CPAP leads to increased risk of CV disease
-other treatments: some can be candidates for surgery to correct soft palate, pacemaker can be inserted to that nerve that opens the airway
-alcohol and hypnotic or narcotics can interfere with respiratory drive and decrease respirations even more

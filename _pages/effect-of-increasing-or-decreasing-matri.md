title: "Effect of increasing or decreasing matrix size?"
---
Image matrix size&#8594; corresponds to the image width and height in pixels
Larger matrix size with constant FOV&#8594; results in smaller pixel size.
&#8595; matrix size by a factor of 2 (256 x 256 vs 512 x 512) &#8594; cuts the time to acquire the images by a factor of 2, &#8593; voxel volume by a factor of 4, and results in &#8593; SNR and &#8595;spatial resolution (as voxel volume &#8593;)

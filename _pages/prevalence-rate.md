title: "Prevalence Rate"
---
-all of the people with a particular health condition existing in a given population at a given point in time (includes new and old cases)

EX. using the same measles scenario, this is if the nurse discovers 50 existing cases of measles out of total school population (50 students with measles/500 population of students(10%))

What is the prevalence rate in black males and black females per 10,000 people in the 1-year period?
Black males:
838 x 10,000 = 283.5 per 10,000 in 1year
29,560
Black females:
1,312 x 10,000 = 463.4 per 10,000 in 1year
28,315

***Because they are asking for the prevalence rate, you will look at the # of black males and females who are living with HIV and divide it by the total population of black males and total population of black females.

-circulating WBCs do not stay in bloodstream

1) Granulocytes leave in 8 hours and live 5 days longer
2) Monocytes leave in 20 hours, transform into macrophages, and live for several years
3) Lymphocytes provide long-term immunity (decades), being continuously recycled from blood to tissue fluid to lymph and back to the blood

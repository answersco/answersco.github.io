title: "Schwannoma"
---
Arises from Schwann cells. Commonly affects vestibulocochlear (VIII) and trigeminal (V) nerves. Cystic degeneration is common, especially in larger lesions. T1 hypointense to gray matter and T2 hyperintense to gray matter. Intense enhancement.

This lesion can also displace the carotid arteries anteromedially, but is not nearly as vascular and does not enhance as homogeneously as a paraganglioma?

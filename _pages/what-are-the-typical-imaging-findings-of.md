title: "What are the typical imaging findings of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease?"
---
Enlarged with innumerable cysts is characteristic of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), but the diagnosis is made by the presence of cysts in multiple organs, a positive family history of polycystic disease, or by genetic testing. Spontaneous hemorrhage into some of the cysts is a characteristic finding as well.

Contiguous with myocardium. Well circumscribed. May be multiple. Most often septal, but can be anywhere. Slightly hypodense to myocardium on NC-CT and T1 iso T2 hyper.

Fibrosis in a peripheral and bibasilar pattern causing &quot;honeycombing,&quot; traction bronchiectasis, and architectural distortion. Bx will show usual interstitial PNA. Limited ground glass. UIP has a poor prognosis but is more common.

Great vessels lie parallel and almost in the same coronal plane. For L-TGA the aortic valve is anterior and slightly to the left (L-loop) of pulmonary valve. For D-TGA the aortic valve is anterior position and to right (D-loop) of pulmonary valve.

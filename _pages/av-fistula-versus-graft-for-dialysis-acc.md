title: "AV fistula versus graft for dialysis access:"
---
AV fistula (AVF): provides good long-term patency (85% at 2 years)
Requires several months to mature, and about 30% fail to mature. 
Fistula is mature when the veins have enlarged sufficiently to allow the high flow rates for dialysis. 
When mature, the fistula can remain patent even with relatively low flow rates.
2 most common fistula locations:
Radial artery&#8594; cephalic vein at wrist
Brachial artery&#8594; variable veins in forearm
Common causes of late fistula failure: include venous outflow stenosis and perianastomotic venous stenosis.

Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft: only have 50% patency at 2 years, but are able to be used sooner than fistulas
Require higher flow rates to remain patent compared to fistulas.
Similar to fistula, the most common cause of graft failure is venous stenosis, either at the venous anastomosis or outflow vein.

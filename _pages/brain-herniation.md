title: "Brain Herniation"

Subfalcine: this is midline shift. Important thing to know is you COULD get ACA compression and therefore ACA stroke.

Descending Transtentorial: Uncus and hippocampus herniate below the tentorium. FIRST thing you will see is ipsilateral cisternal effacement. 
&#8212;Other important associations: Durets hemorrhages, compression of CN3 between PCA &amp; Superior Cerebellar Artery causing IPSILATERAL ptosis and dilated pupil. 

Ascending Transtentorial: Vermis will herniate UP through the tentorium. Think about this with POSTERIOR FOSSA masses. This oftren results in SEVERE hydrocephalus. 
&#8212;Other imporant associations: reversal of the &quot;smile&quot; of the quadrigeminal plate cistern, spinning top sign

Cerebellar Tonsilar Herniation: This is going to either be from SEVERE descending transtentorial herniation OR could be chiari malformation

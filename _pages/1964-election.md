title: "1964 election"
---
LBJ runs against Barry Goldwater and wins in a landslide. Goldwater is a hard line conservative and runs on &quot;less govt&quot;&amp;tough on communism, but most voters like LBJ's social &amp; economic initiatives and fear G-W is too much of a &quot;hawk&quot;. LBJ also gets a Democrat majority in Congress, even w/o southern democrats and can now push Civil Rights legislation.

title: "Digoxin action"
---
1) cardiac glycoside
2) increases intracellular Ca++ by allowing more Ca++ to enter cell which will allow for better contraction
3) positive inotrope
4) increased CO
5) increased renal perfusion
-decreased renin release --- RAAS system will not be kicked on
-increased UOP
6) negative chronotrope - affects HR : slow down HR
7) negative dromotrope - affects electrical conduction across AV node - process will slow down

title: "Nutrition and metabolism impact on immobility of function"
---
1) decreased metabolic rate &amp; anorexia: oxygen demand of the body at rest is decreased meaning brain, heart, and body systems need less oxygen when at rest resulting in a decreased metabolic rate
2) negative nitrogen balance: usually when people are in the hospital, it is due to an illness which increases metabolic rate working against the decreased metabolic rate creating a negative nitrogen balance, when muscles and tissues are being broken down faster than we are taking in nutrients to replace them
3) impaired immunity 
4) pressure ulcers

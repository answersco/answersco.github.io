title: "SCFE - which view to order next?"
---
Frog leg view (MRI is most sensitive in the pre-slip phase)
- Klein's line is abnormal (line through superior aspect of femoral neck will NOT intersect with epiphysis)

* Tx = Femoral head pinning WITHOUT reduction (increases risk of AVN)

(bilateral in 25-30% of overweight black kids age 10-15 yo), 

While Legg Calve Perthes is only bilateral in 10% of younger white kids

title: "What MRI artifact is commonly seen at high-contrast interfaces and how do you improve it?"
---
Truncation/Gibbs: ripples in k-space data, especially at abrupt tissue intensity changes- produce appearance of lines, classically seen at high-contrast interfaces (skull-brain, cord-CSF, meniscus/fluid).
-CSF-cord location is classic- mimics syrinx.
-Due to limited sampling of free induction decay.
-Can be in frequency or phase encoding direction, but more commonly phase-encoding

Improve it: more matrix
-Decrease the bandwidth or decrease the pixel size (more PE steps, less FOV, more matrix)
-Penalty: increased acquisition time and reduced per-pixel SNR.

title: "Motion artifact - Ghosting  Appearance: Direction: Better: Worse: Comments:"
---
Appearance: Duplicate copies, possibly many; May be shifted by 1/2 FOV; gross motion is seen as blurring
Direction: Phase encoding
Better:Saturation pulses, respiratory gating, faster sequences, eddy current correction, switch phase direction
Worse: Sequences which place a high demand on gradient performance (EPI)
Comments: Nyquist is when there are errors in gradient timing (EPI)

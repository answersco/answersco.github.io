title: "Zippers/spike noise artifact:"
---
Appearance&#8594; 
Stippled/dashed band though the image.
Banding runs primarily along the phase-encoding direction.

Causes&#8594; detection of extraneous RF signals during readout.

Common Occurrences&#8594; 
Incompatible or malfunctioning medical equipment inside MR scanning room (e.g. syringe pump).
Breached RF shielding of scan room, or door to scan room left open.

Remedy&#8594; 
Make sure the door to the scanner room is closed.
Have equipment operating in the scan room (e.g. pumps) checked for RF emissions.
Call on medical physics staff or field engineer to find RF leak in shielding.

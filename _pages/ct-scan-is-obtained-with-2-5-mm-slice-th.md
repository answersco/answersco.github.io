title: "CT scan is obtained with 2.5 mm slice thickness. If the data are reconstructed at 10 mm slice thickness, what is the effect on image mottle?"
---
Mottle will be reduced by a factor of 2

Quadrupling slice thickness quadruples the # of photons in a CT image. Mottle is inversely related to the square root of the # of photos, and will thus be halved.

title: "Functional versus anatomic popliteal artery entrapment"
---
Normal anatomy of popliteal artery as it exits popliteal fossa: to pass between the heads of the gastrocnemius and posterior to the popliteus muscle

Functional entrapment syndrome: normal anatomy, but hypertrophy of the plantaris, medial gastrocs, and soleus muscles
-With plantar flexion, the plantaris and medial gastrocs compress the artery against the lateral femoral condyle, and the soleus compresses it against the lateral soleal band.
-The arteries remain normal in these patients despite repetitive compression.

Anatomic entrapment:
-Popliteal artery has a different relationship to these muscles, which results in compression of the artery with exercise.
-Leads first to adventitial thickening and fibrosis, followed by aneurysm formation, thrombosis, and distal embolization.

Both are mimicked by chronic recurrent exertional compartment syndrome, a more common cause of symmetric calf pain in young athletes.

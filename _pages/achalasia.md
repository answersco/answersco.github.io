GE sphincter fails to relax because of Wallerian degeneration of Auerbach's plexus
Etiology:
 idiopathic
 destruction of plexus by tumor cells (mets, adenoca)
 Chaga's disease
Idiopathic - 20-40 year old
Manometry most sensitive
Tertiary waves with no LES relaxation
Discoordinated esophageal contrations

...

dilated esophagus

motor d/o
distal 2/3 (smooth muscle) doesn't peristalse (absent primary peristalsis)
+ LES doesnt relax/slowly relaxes

Birds Beak (smooth stricture @ GEJ)

Incr Risk of Candida, Squamous CA


Vigorous Achalasia = early/less severe. repetitive non-propulsive contractions. More common in F. But CA more common in M.

Chagas Dz ~ Jungle. Esophagus paralyzed by parasite. Apperance identical to Achalasia.

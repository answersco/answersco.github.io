title: "MRI gradient field: FDA limits"
---
FDA limits gradient dB/dt to that &quot;sufficient to produce severe discomfort or painful stimulation.&quot;
Threshold for instantaneous acoustic trauma is 140 dB
Use of the highest duty cycle sequences (e.g. EPI and DTI) permits acoustic noise at the patient to near these levels.
Properly fitted earplugs offer about 10-30 dB protection
Headphones offer an additional 10-30 dB.
In tandem, they &#8595; SPL by at least 40 dB, well below the recommended 99 dBA limit
FDA significant risk criteria for sound pressure level (SPL) is:
Peak unweighted SPL &gt; 140 dB and...
Weighted root mean square (RMS) sound pressure level &gt; 99 dBA with hearing protection in place.

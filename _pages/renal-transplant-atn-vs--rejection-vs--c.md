title: "Renal transplant ATN vs. Rejection vs. cyclosporine toxicity"
---
ATN: usually first week post-transplant, more common in cadaveric donors.
-PRESERVED RENAL PERFUSION
-Delayed excretion in renal parenchyma (elevated 20/3 ratio, delayed TTP)
-Usually gets better

CSP toxicity: looks like ATN (normal perfusion, retained tracer) - but not in immediate post-op period.

Rejection: acute is usually immediately post-op
-POOR PERFUSION
-Delayed excretion
-Chronic: won't really take up tracer

In normal DMSA or ATN (with MAG3), nephrographic appearance is the same: tracer in the cortex, and that's it.

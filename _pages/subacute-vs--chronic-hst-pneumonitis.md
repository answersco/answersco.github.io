title: "Subacute vs. chronic HST pneumonitis"
---
Usually imaged in subacute phase:
Patchy GGO
Ill-defined centrilobular ground-glass nodules
Often has mosaic perfusion and air trapping.

Chronic: looks like UIP + air-trapping
Traction bronchiectasis + air-trapping
&quot;Head-cheese&quot; - mix of everything (GGO, consolidation, air-trapping, and normal lung).

title: "What is unusual about the radiographs in acromegaly-induced arthropathy of the joint spaces, in contrast to all of the other arthropathies"
---

As opposed to narrowing or staying the same size

**in late-stage acromegaly arthropathy, there IS NARROWING of the joint space due to the secondary osteoarthritis that usually occurs

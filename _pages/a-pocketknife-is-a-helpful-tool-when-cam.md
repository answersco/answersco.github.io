title: "A pocketknife is a helpful tool when camping"
---
A pocketknife is useful when camping. You might need it to cut a rope when setting up your campsite. If you are missing a tent stake, you can use your knife to make one from a stick. When you go fishing, a pocketknife is helpful for cutting bait and fishing lines. If you use your knife to sharpen one end of a long stick, you can cook hot dogs or marshmallows over the campfire.

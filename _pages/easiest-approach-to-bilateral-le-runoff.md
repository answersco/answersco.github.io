title: "Easiest approach to bilateral LE runoff imaging"
---
Bilateral LE runoffs are obtained with the catheter at the Ao bifurcation using two basic strategies
-Simplest strategy is STATIONARY imaging of overlapping areas of the legs
-Small (10-20 mL) contrast injections are performed with filming at 1-2 frames/sec until all vessels are fully opacified at the level being imaged. Rapidly filling normal arteries and slowly-filling reconstituted arteries are both easily imaged.
-Overall volume of contrast necessary is dependent upon the severity of disease. As the length and # of occlusions increase, more contrast is needed to opacify reconstituted distal vessels.

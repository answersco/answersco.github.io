title: "Findings in infection of prosthetic graft material"
---
Suggested by perigraft fluid and/or air. 
Following aortic surgery, perigraft air should be reabsorbed within 2-3 weeks, and fluid within 2-3 months.
Delayed appearance or persistence of perigraft fluid and air on imaging are highly suggestive of infection.
Other findings include soft-tissue stranding, lack of fat planes between graft material and bowel, graft thrombosis, and anastomotic pseudoaneurysms

If seen, angio findings include intraluminal irregularities, focal anastomotic outpouchings, and very rarely opacification of bowel.

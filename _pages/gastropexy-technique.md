title: "Gastropexy technique"
---
Gastropexy fixes anterior wall of stomach to anterior abdominal wall, preventing guidewire buckling into peritoneal cavity and early or late intraperitoneal leakage.
-With stomach maximally inflated, puncture site into stomach is chosen midway between the superior and inferior margins of the inflated stomach just proximal to incisura.
-2.5 cm square around puncture site marked, and 4 corners anesthetized.
-A slotted 18-gauge needle attached to syringe partially filled with saline used to insert 4 T-fasteners at the corners of the square.
-When air is aspirated, the syringe is removed and the stylet used to push the T-fastener through the needle into the stomach.
-Stylet and needle are removed, and gentle tension on the external nylon suture opposes the stomach wall to the abdominal wall.
-Stomach fixed in position by crimping the metal cylinders around the suture using forceps.

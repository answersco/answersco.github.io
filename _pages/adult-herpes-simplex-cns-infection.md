May cause encephalitis or cranial neuritis. 70% mortality rate in untreated patients. Ill-defined hypodensities within one or both temporal lobes. Virus is usually latent within gasserian ganglion. Frontal lobes may be involved. Insular cortex is often involved, but adjacent putamen is spared. Usually swelling with mass effect. Streaky enhancement is variable. The CT findings are not usually seen before the fifth day of symptoms. Increased FLAIR and T2 signal within temporal and/or frontal lobe(s) with sparing of putamen. Middle cerebral artery infarct (often involves putamen, unlike herpes).

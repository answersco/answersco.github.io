title: "Transposition of Great Areteries:  - general info - how to find out which one is RV? - D vs L-transposition"
---
TGA: 
- most common cause of cyanosis during 1st 24 hours of life
- associated with diabetic mothers
- Survival depends on ASD, VSD, or PDA (most commonly VSD)

Right ventricle: 
- defined by moderator band (find it)

D-transposition:
- &quot;Deadly&quot; one
- CXR finding: &quot;egg on a string&quot;
- only has PDA connecting the 2 systems, which would otherwise be incompatible with life
- Fix: Intra-atrial baffle (Mustard or Senning procedure)

L-transposition: 
- &quot;Lucky&quot; that it is compatible with life (congenitally corrects)
- &quot;Double discordance&quot; - atrium hooks up with wrong ventricle, and ventricles hook up with wrong vessels (inversion of ventricles)
- Doesn't require PDA for survival.

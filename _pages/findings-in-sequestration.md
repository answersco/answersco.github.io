Sequestration&#8594; aberrant lung tissue with systemic blood supply (usually aortic)
Key finding: systemic arterial vessel
Usually LUL, and typically solid (unlike CPAM)
Extralobar: external to pleura, with primarily systemic venous drainage
May occasionally be below diaphragm near the adrenal, simulating a mass.
Intralobar: inside pleura, usually with pulmonary venous drainage.

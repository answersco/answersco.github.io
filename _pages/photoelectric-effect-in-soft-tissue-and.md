title: "Photoelectric effect in soft tissue and bone:"
---
Dominates at &lt; 25 keV in soft tissue and &lt; 40 keV in bone
Primary interaction in materials with high atomic #
Iodine (Z=53), barium (Z=56), and lead (Z=82) &#8594; iodine and barium excellent materials for enhancing contrast, and lead an excellent radiation shielding material.
Materials used for the target and filters usually high atomic # &#8594; photoelectric effect predominates.
Probability of PLE varies inversely with cube of the energy
PLE ~ Z3/E3

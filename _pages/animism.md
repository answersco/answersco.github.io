title: "Animism"
---
Belief that objects, such as plants and stones, or natural events, like thunderstorms and earthquakes, have a discrete spirit and conscious life.

This type of religious belief holds that everything--including animals and objects like rocks-- has an &quot;anima&quot; which is Latin for &quot;soul&quot; or &quot;spirit.&quot; Animists believe that these spirits in the natural world along with various gods influence human events. Before 10,000 B.C.E., religious beliefs were likely animistic. Animistic religions are polytheistic and have been practiced almost every part of the world.

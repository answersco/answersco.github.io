title: "Stents: primary stenting vs angioplasty (PTA), anticoagulation"
---
In practice, the tendency is to place a stent as the 1st intervention without trying to optimize the result of PTA (primary stenting)

In some cases it is wise to attempt PTA first, reserving stents for failed or recurrent lesions
-Especially true in heavily calcified lesions that may not respond to PTA or stenting.

No significant advantage over PTA in FMD.

Anticoagulation (heparin or bivalirudin bolus) should be used during stent placement
-1-3 month course of antiplatelet therapy (ASA and/or clopidogrel) often prescribed after stent placement.

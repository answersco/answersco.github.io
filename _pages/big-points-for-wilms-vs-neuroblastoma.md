title: "Big points for Wilms vs Neuroblastoma?"
---
Neuroblastoma = can occur VERY YOUNG, even at birth
* Calcifies and mets to Bone (easy to remember)
* Does NOT invade vessels, it encases them
- poorly marginated
- Virchow's node
* Stage 3: Tumor that infiltrates across the midline +/- regional LN involvement, unilateral tumor with contralateral node, or midline tumor with b/l LN involvement - NO LONGER RECEIVES SURGERY
- can undergo spontaneous maturation into a BENIGN ganglioneuroma
- METS:
&gt; 12 mo = BONE

&lt; 12 mo = liver and skin = Bone

90% metabolically active
85% calcified
75% crossed midline (e.g. stage 3)

&lt; 2yo, MEDIASTINUM are BETTER

NO need for PET

Pepper syndrome = multiple small hepatic mets

Assoc with NF-1, NOT NF-2!
_______________________________________________

WILMS = Age 4 yo (NOT before 2 months)
* Rarely calcifies
* Well circumscribed ball
- central necrosis common
(contrasted from neuroblastoma which often calcifies!)
- Surgically staged

Cortically based mass that rarely involves the collecting system; Large presentation &gt; 5 cm, claw-sign

3-4 yo (rare in neonates and &gt; 8yo)

* 10% will INVADE IVC; Note that invasion of the IVC does NOT change the stage (just the surgical management)

Choledochal cysts: heterogeneous pathway of diseases with common end pathway of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation
Up to 25% increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma&#8594; most are resected
Unlike biliary hamartomas, choledochal cysts DO communicate with the biliary tree
Type I: fusiform CBD dilation (most common)
Type II: extrahepatic saccular dilatation
Type III: dilation of intraduodenal bile duct
Type IV: multiple segments dilated 
Type V: intrahepatic dilatation = Caroli disease
-May be segmental or diffuse. Associated with polycystic kidneys
-Caroli syndrome = Caroli disease + hepatic fibrosis
Central dot sign: describes the small branches of the PV and HA bridging the dilated bile ducts, which look like a central dot on CECT.

Congenital malformations of intraor extrahepatic bile ducts. May present with jaundice, pain, right upper quadrant mass. Most common is type 1: fusiform or saccular dilation of common bile duct below the cystic duct.

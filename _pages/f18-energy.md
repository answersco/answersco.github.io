title: "F18 energy"
---
18F &#8594; emits a positron with energy of 0.635 MeV &#8594; travels a maximum of 2.4 mm before annihilating with an electron to produce two 511 keV photons that travel away in opposite directions.
Typically 370-555 MBq (10-15 mCi) of 18F-FDG for adults 
PET study usually ~1 hour after FDG administration.

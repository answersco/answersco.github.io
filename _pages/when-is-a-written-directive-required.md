When you're giving therapeutic doses (not for everyday nuclear imaging).

A written directive must be dated and signed by an authorized user before the administration of I-131 sodium iodide greater than 1.11 megabecquerels (MBq) (30 microcuries [&#181;Ci]), any therapeutic dosage of unsealed by-product material or any therapeutic dose of radiation from by-product material.

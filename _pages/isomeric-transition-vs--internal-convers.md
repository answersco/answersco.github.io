title: "Isomeric transition vs. internal conversion"
---
Isomeric transition (good): any process that gives off gamma radiation but doesn't change # of protons or neutrons.

Internal conversion (bad): excess energy exceeds binding energy, creating an ejected electron + characteristic radiation.

These compete with each other - ratio termed &quot;alpha&quot;
-Lower alpha = more useful radiation, and less harmful radiation produced.

title: "Arterial supply to pancreas"
---
Derived from both celiac artery and SMA.
Head: supplied by paired pancreaticoduodenal arteries anterior and posterior to head.
-Superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries arise from gastroduodenal
-Interior pancreaticoduodenal arteries arise from common trunk off proximal SMA

Body: supplied by dorsal pancreatic artery, usually a proximal branch of splenic artery or celiac artery, and contributes to the transverse pancreatic artery running the length of the gland. It less commonly arises from SMA or aorta.

Numerous small arteries arise directly from the splenic artery to supply the body and tail (small pancreatic arteries, including the pancreatica magna artery).

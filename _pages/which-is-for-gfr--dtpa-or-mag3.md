title: "Which is for GFR (DTPA or MAG3)?"

Tc99m-DTPA (it's almost all filtered)
- slightly underestimates
- Concentrated better in kidneys with NORMAL renal function

MAG3 = Exclusive secreted so good for Effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) 
- Concentrated better in kidneys with POOR renal function
- &quot;Poor MAGE&quot;

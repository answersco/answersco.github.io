title: "Klippel-Feil syndrome."
---
Sprengel deformity (hypoplastic, elevated scapula). Omovertebral bone. Fused cervical vertebrae. Hemivertebrae. Kyphoscoliosis. Rib anomalies.

Congenital fusion of 2 or more cervical vertabrae, a/w scoliosis, 
spina bifida, kidneys and rib anomalies, cleft palate, respiratory problems, heart malformations. short stature, congenital elevation of the scapula known as Sprengel's Deformity

Type 1 Chiari
Congenital C-spine fusion
Syrinx
Omovertebral bone

Failure of cervical segmentation at multiople levels. 
Often associated wiht a short neck and a low hairline.
They have limited cervical motion and increaed risk for renal, spinal cord, and ear (inner, middle, and outer) abnormalities.
Can be differentiated from surgical fusion by the narrow AP dimension of the vertebral bodies.

JIA: has a similar appearance, but typically involves more levels.
Sprengel deformity: seeen in Klippel-Feil syndrome, referring to tethering of the scapula to the cervical spine by a fibrous band, leading to a high position of the scapula.

-Chiari type 1

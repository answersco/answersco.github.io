title: "Inferior displacement of cerebellar tonsils beyond foramen magnum:"
---
Chiari I malformation &#8594; inferior displacement of cerebellar tonsils beyond foramen magnum. May be associated with sleep apnea and feeding problems in babies.
Most common complications are cervical syringomyelia and less commonly hydrocephalus
Syringomyelia: fusiform dilation of central canal that does not typically communicate with the 4th ventricle.
Classic criterion for diagnosis: herniation of either cerebellar tonsil by 5 mm, or both tonsils by 3 mm
More confident diagnosis if associated pointing of cerebellar tonsils, crowding of posterior fossa, cervical spine syringomyelia, or hydrocephalus.

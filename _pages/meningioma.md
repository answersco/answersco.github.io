hypointense on T1. 
peritumoral vasogenic edema.
as they enlarge, may recruit pial vascular supply.

Most common extra-axial neoplasm of adults. Peak age of 50 to 60 years. Occur more commonly within women. Multiple tumors are associated with neurofibromatosis. Common locations: Parasagittal or convexity locations (50%). Sphenoid wing (20%). Olfactory groove/planum sphenoidale (10%). Parasellar region (10%). Hyerdense, hyperenhancing mass with variable surrounding edema. Calcification occurs in 10% to 20% of cases. Angiographically, early dense tumor blush that persists well into venous phase,

Meningiomas are the most common extraaxial intracranial tumors. Meningiomas are rare in patients younger than 20 years, and if present, are commonly associated with neurofibromatosis type 2. CT is the best imaging modality for demonstrating calcification, which can be seen in 25% of cases. Hyperdense extraaxial mass that is isointense on T1 imaging, with trapped cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clefts and cortical vessels around its margins, and associated peritumoral vasogenic edema is classic for meningioma.

-originates from arachnoid cap cells
-uncommon locations:
---lateral ventricles (peds)
---optic nerve sheath (adult females)

remember that these **** boys like to cause hyperostosis

-extra-axial mass
-dural thickening and hyperostosis
-calcify
-can occur post-radiation
-most common over cerebral convexity
-octreotide, MDP HOT

enhance homogeneously, don't invade IAC, calcify, dural tail, broad dural base, a/w hyperostosis, MC location: over cerebral convexity

Neonatal &#8593; pulmonary venous flow (pulmonary edema):
Hypoplastic left heart (similar physiology to CHF)
Aortic coarctation
CHF&#8594; due to primary cardiac anomaly or extracardiac AV shunt, such as vein of Galen malformation or hepatic hemangioendothelioma.
Neonatal sepsis (typically in setting of neonatal PNA)

&#8593; pulmonary arterial flow (shunt vascularity) &#8594; tends to present in childhood rather than in neonatal period.
ASD
VSD
PDA
Endocardial cushion defect (ECD) &#8594; strong association with Down syndrome.

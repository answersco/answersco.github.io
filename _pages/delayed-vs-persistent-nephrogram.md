title: "Delayed vs persistent nephrogram"
---
Delayed = contrast cannot get into the kidney either from extrinsic compression or from internal increased pressure
- Typically seen with PAGE kidney OR with hydronephrosis OR probs could see with pyeloneph

Persistent = contrast is not good at LEAVING the kidney
- Typically seen with ATN (cannot get that shit out) or HYPOtension (cannot clear the kidney out)

The trick to see if it is delayed vs persistent is they are going to HAVE to tell you the time course, i.e., if this is 3 hours after contrast admin then it is PERSISTENT

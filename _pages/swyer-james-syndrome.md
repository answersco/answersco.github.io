title: "Swyer-James Syndrome"
---
Acquired hypoplastic lung following severe obliterative bronchiolitis. Air trapping causes little change in lung size on expiration (different from congenital hypoplastic lung).

Postinfectious obliterative bronchiolitis, results in underdevelopment of 1 lung or region of a lung, and appears as hyperlucency due to expansion of remaining alveoli.

Volume loss and hyperlucency of a lung/lobe as a sequelae of severe viral infection

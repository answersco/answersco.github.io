title: "Primary interaction effecting PET photon detection?"

Compton Scatter. Photoelectric effect is minimal. Compton scatter is estimated to account for &gt;50% of photons detected on 3D whole body PET. Using models to correct for scatter improves reconstruction. Results in loss of contrast, ie loss of signal.

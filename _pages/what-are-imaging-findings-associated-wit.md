title: "What are imaging findings associated with dermoids?"
---
Dermoids are more likely to contain fat and more likely to occur at the glabella/nasal bridge.

Epidermoids are bright on DWI, which is highly characteristic. They are more usually of fluid attenuation on CT and follow fluid signal all MR imaging sequences.

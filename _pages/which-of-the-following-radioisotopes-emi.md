title: "Which of the following radioisotopes emits particles having the highest probability of undergoing Bremsstrahlung interaction: Y-90, Tc-99m, F-18, Ra-223?"
---
Y-90.
Bremsstrahlung interaction is the result of energy loss by a charged particle in the vicinity of the nucleus. High-energy electrons (such as those emitted by Y-90), by virtue of their smaller mass and negative charge are more likely to approach the nucleus and lose energy via Bremsstrahlung.

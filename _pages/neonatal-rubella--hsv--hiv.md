Rubella&#8594; less common calcification than in other TORCH infection
May see focal high T2 signal in white matter (vasculopathy and ischemic injury)

HSV (90% HSV-2): thrombus and hemorrhagic infarction with resulting encephalomalacia and atrophy (hydranencephaly commonly)

HIV&#8594; not technically TORCH
Brain atrophy, predominantly frontal lobes
Faint basal ganglia calcification before more pronounced calcification

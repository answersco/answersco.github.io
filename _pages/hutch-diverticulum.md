title: "Hutch diverticulum"
---
Congenital bladder diverticulum, not associated with posterior urethral valve or neurogenic bladder, occur almost exclusively in boys. These kind of diverticulae are seen approx. 1.7% of cases3.

Hutch diverticulum are commonly seen with vesicoureteric reflux, because normal slanted insertion of ureter is altered.

Contrast filled outpouchings arising from urinary bladder arising at vesicoureteric junction, and often seen with vesicoureteric reflux. Round or oval anechoic fluid collections arising from base of urinary bladder or around ureteric orifice1.

Incidentally detected diverticulum, usually doesn't require any therapy. If associated with VUR, recurrent UTI or obstruction, it should be excised. However, because of risk of development of carcinoma, many surgeons argue prophylactic surgery in all cases. Hutch diverticulum are prone to spontaneous rupture, as well as post-surgical relapse.

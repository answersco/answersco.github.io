---
T2 bright areas and atrophy related to known radiation port
Can also see hemosiderin deposition and mineralization microangiopathy involving the subcortical white matter and basal ganglia
There is typically a lag period of 2 months

Whole brain radiation: typically T2 bright in the periventricular white matter that then begins to extend out to the subcortex later
Localized radiation: Typically can be seen as mass effect, edema, and enhancement

The aorta arises from the ventricle that is positioned on the left (Fig 1a, 1b). This ventricle has a muscular outflow tract (infundibulum) (Fig 1b) that separates the atrioventricular and aortic valves, trabeculations along the ventricular septum, and a moderator band (Fig 1d), which are characteristic of a morphologic right ventricle. The main pulmonary artery originates from the ventricle located on the right (Fig 1a, 1b). This chamber has continuity of the atrioventricular and pulmonary valves without a muscular outflow tract (Fig 1b) and a smooth septal wall (Fig 1d), which are features of a morphologic left ventricle.

title: "Stages vs. Continuity"
---
-Do we see behavior change in discrete, sudden shifts (stages) as we age?
VS.
-do we see behavior change slowly, along a gradual continuum (continually) as we develop?
EX. sudden = baby talking and learning so quickly
gradual = sleep stages (gradually go into deep sleep and gradually come out)

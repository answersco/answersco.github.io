title: "Slice selection gradient"
---
This is how you select the SLICE that you want to figure out looks like
Note the localization gradient can be turned on and off
The main magnent Bo IS ALWAYS ON

This is what allows you to select the PLANE of the image
Basically it causes a gradient across the image in terms of proton frequency (you can then administer an RF pulse to select the protons that are precessing at a specific frequency)

AKA selective pulse
Perpendicular to desired slice plane
Can be turned on and off (unlike main field)
RF pulse delivered on top of gradient
Spin echo imaging - 180 degree refocusing pulse affects edges of field -&gt; two identical gradients placed in opposite directions to fix errors at edges

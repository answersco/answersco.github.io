title: "5 P's of circulation"
---
assess the skin of area distal to the bandage for:
1) pallor
2) paresthesia
3) pain
4) pulselessness
5) paralysis
-all bad things but establish baseline data bc you may make things worse after you apply the banadage so assess the 5 P's before and after putting on bandages

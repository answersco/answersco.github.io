III: Into ventricles WITH ventricular dilatation

IV: Into the brain parenchyma

RISK FACTORS: Male, Prematurity, Multiple gestations, Birth trauma, Prolonged labor, &amp; low birth weight

Germinal matrix is only at the caudothalamic groove at 32 weeks; by 36 weeks, it's no longer around

Grade I-II: often normal development
High grade: Can range from spastic quadraparesis and developmental delay

Most common US window for baby head: Anterior fontanelle!

Posterior fontanelle used for posterior supratentorial and infratentorial structures

Synovial sarcoma: usually lower extremities in patient 20-40 years old
Close to joint, but not in the joint
Could see one of 3 ways:
Triple sign: T2 MRI (likely knee) with high, medium, and low signal all in same mass
Bowl of grapes: bunch of fluid-fluid levels in a mass (probably knee)
XR: soft-tissue component and calcifications
Should present as a painful mass (most sarcomas are painless)
Soft-tissue calcifications + bone erosions are highly suggestive
Slow-growing and small in size
Most common malignancy of foot, ankle, and LE.

title: "Spoiled GRE:"

Spoiled GRE &#8594; allows for very short TR values and high T1-weighted contrast
Residual transverse magnetization is destroyed (spoiled) after each echo&#8594; thus the formation of each echo begins solely with longitudinal magnetization (the amount of longitudinal magnetization reflects T1 relaxation rates)
Spoiling occurs by either:
Gradient spoiling: strong spoiler gradient.
RF spoiling (more common): phase changes in RF excitation

AKA incoherent GRE
Gradients and/or RF pulses get rid of persistent steady state T2* magnetization
Looks like T1

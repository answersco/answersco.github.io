title: "Decreased FOV (mag)"
---
II systems only: Less minificiation. Due to ABC (brightness control) the dose will increase to compensate for the decreased signal to the output phosphor (kvp, mas, pulse rate etc). Din/Dout squared. 
Resolution will improve with smaller imaged part however limited by the screen/raster lines. 
FPD: doesn't change spatial resolution

Direct signs: These are the signs that occur at the stenosis itself. You will see INCREASED peak systolic velocity and spectral broadening just immediately in the post stenotic area. 

Indirect signs: You will have tardus parvus wave form post stenosis w/ acceleration time &gt; 70 ms, the RI downstream will be low &lt; 0.5 (this is because the vessel is trying to dilate up as much as possible to increase flow - think about post-stenotic dilation), the RI upstream will be HIGH (&gt;0.7) because the blood needs to overcome the area of stenosis.

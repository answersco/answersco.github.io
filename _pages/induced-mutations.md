title: "Induced mutations"
---
-caused by mutagens many are also carcinogens and cause cancer

Examples in nature: 
-alkylating agents: remove a base
-acridine dyes: add or remove base
-x rays: break chromosomes
-UV radiation: creates thymine dimers, used for sterilizations

-can have site-directed mutagenesis which is a research technique -- Changes a gene in a desired way (&lt; $200)
-try to induce a gene change with xray to create new organisms like gmos

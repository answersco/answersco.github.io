Tc-99m MDP &#8594; technetium labeled diphosphonate
Mechanism of uptake is phosphonate binding to bone, which is referred to as chemisorption.
20 mCi typically administered&#8594; imaging usually done 2-4 hours later.
Rapid renal excretion is normal &#8594; diffuse soft tissue uptake can be seen in renal failure
Patients should void before imaging to prevent the bladder from obscuring a pelvic lesion.
3 phase study
To evaluate for osteomyelitis (OM) in the presence of an underlying abnormality (such as fracture or prosthesis) &#8594; WBC imaging (indium-111 or Tc-99m-labeled WBCs) combined with a Tc-99m sulfur-colloid marrow scan can &#8593; specificity for OM.
Focal WBC activity in a region devoid of colloid marrow is suggestive of OM.
Gallium-67 scan can also &#8593; specificity for OM if the gallium uptake exceeds the bone scan uptake in the area of concern (rarely performed)

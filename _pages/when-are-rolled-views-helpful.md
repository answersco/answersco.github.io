title: "When are rolled views helpful?"
---
For localizing a lesion only seen on the CC

Rolling medial: superior tumor will move medially, and an inferior tumor will move laterally
Rolling lateral: superior tumor will move laterally, and inferior tumor will move medially

Superior tumors move in the direction you roll.
Inferior tumors will move in the opposite of the direction you roll.

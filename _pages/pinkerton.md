title: "Pinkerton"

conspiracy expanded liability test; liable for conspiracy + crime of conspiracy + CRIMES OF CO-CONSPIRATORS (reasonable, natural/probable consequences, even if outside agreement/original scope); states/MPC do NOT follow this; you're on the hook until last co-conspirator stops acting unless you do something to disavow or defeat the purpose (frustrate purpose)

title: "External iliac artery branches"

Typical diameter of EIA = 5-7 mm
Circumflex iliac arteries (superficial and deep) arise laterally
Inferior epigastric artery: arises medially
These branches mark the transition from the EIA to the CFA.

In 20% of patients, the obturator artery is replaced to the EIA, usually arising from common trunk with inferior epigastric artery.

If patient is septic, drain immediately

The other determining factor is whether CM was injected above the level of the obstruction during failed ERCP.
-If not CM injected and patient not septic, PTC can be performed within 2 days.
-If CM was injected above the obstruction, start IV fluids and perform PTC within 8-12 hours.

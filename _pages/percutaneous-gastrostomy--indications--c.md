title: "Percutaneous gastrostomy: indications, contraindications, and usage timing."
---
Indications: esophageal, head/neck, and neurologic disease. Long-term bowel decompression (e.g. palliation of malignant bowel obstruction or prolonged ileus)
There is strong evidence that gastrostomy does NOT improve survival or quality of life in elderly patients with dementia and decreased PO intake.
Contraindications: lack of appropriate window (e.g. colonic interposition), extensive gastric varices, and uncorrectable coagulopathy.
Gastrostomy can be used 24 hours after placement after the patient is evaluated for peritoneal signs.
Must remain in place for at least 1 month to form a mature tract.

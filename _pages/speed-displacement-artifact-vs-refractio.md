title: "Speed displacement artifact vs refraction artifact?"
---
Speed displacement is easy = when the speed of sound SLOWS down somewhere (e.g. in some fat in the liver), the probe thinks it took longer to return and thus must be &quot;deeper&quot;. You get a discontinuous focal liver border

Refraction artifact = change in direction of sound beam due to speed difference in different tissues.
1) objects wider than they really are
2) object can be misplaced to side of returning echo
3) object can appear duplicated
Classic: Duplicated SMA due to being deep to rectus muscles and midline fat
- Improve by angling the transducer or moving it to the side

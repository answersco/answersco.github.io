title: "QA: Accuracy check?"
---
Accuracy: Performed yearly. Evaluates the correctness of reading an activity value with a detector. For this test, the activity of sealed calibrated sources (typically Co-57, Ba-133 and Cs-137, representative of low, medium and high energies) is measured three times. The average value of the three measurements is then compared to the expected activity, corrected for time decay, and must not differ from it more than &#177;5%.

title: "Panda sign on gallium study:"
---
Represents increased uptake in the nasopharynx, parotid glands, and lacrimal glands due to inflammation.
Classically due to sarcoidosis, though not specific. Highly suggestive in presence of lambda sign (due to bilateral hilar and right paratracheal LAD). Sarcoid is also the most common disorder to affect the salivary and lacrimal glands symmetrically.
DDX of panda sign: sarcoid, Sjogren syndrome, lymphoma after radiation, and AIDS.

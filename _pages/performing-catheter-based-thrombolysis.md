title: "Performing catheter-based thrombolysis"
---
For catheter-based thrombolysis, multi-side-hole catheters must be placed across the entire length of the thrombus.
-A triaxial system can be assembled: infusion through a 5-6 Fr sheath at the access site, a 5-Fr infusion catheter in the middle segment, and a 3-Fr infusion catheter extending to the most central portion of the thrombus.
-Patients received systemic unfractionated heparin during the thrombolysis and should be maintained on chronic therapeutic anticoagulation afterward.
-Infusion for 2 and rarely 3 days may be required.
-Need for IVC filters during these procedures is unclear.

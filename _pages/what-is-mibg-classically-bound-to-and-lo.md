Critical organ = I-123MIBG bladder; I-131MIBG liver

* For PHEO, NEUROBLASTOMA, and Paraganglioma
- superior for Neuroblastoma bone mets

* Give Lugol's solution (SSKI = potassium iodine) to block the thyroid gland and prevent unintended radiation to the gland

 * Must HOLD Ca channel blockers, labetalol, reserpine, TCAs, and sympthaomimetics

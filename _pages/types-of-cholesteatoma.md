On the left the coronal images of the same patient as above. 
Notice how the cholesteatoma has eroded the scutum (arrow).

There are two patterns of spread: 
&#8226;Pars flaccida cholesteatoma
The lesion starts anterosuperiorly in 'Prussaks space', the area just below the scutum, which is limited by the tympanic membrane, the malleus, and the lateral ligament of the malleus. 
A cholesteatoma will then extend laterally towards the ossicular chain and into the epitympanum. 
&#8226;Pars tensa cholesteatoma 
The cholesteatoma begins posterosuperiorly and extends posteriorly towards the facial recess and tympanic sinus, and medially towards the ossicular chain.

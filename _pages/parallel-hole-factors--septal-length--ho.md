title: "Parallel hole factors: septal length, hole diameter, and septal thickness"
---
Long septa:
-Low sensitivity (noisy)
-High spatial resolution
Short septa:
-High sensitivity, low spatial resolution

Wider hole diameter: high sensitivity, low resolution
Narrow hole: low sensitivity, high resolution

Thick septa: less penetration, less available space for holes (less sensitivity)
Thin septa: more penetration (blur), more available space for holes (more sensitivity)

Generally want long, thick septa + wide holes for high energy and short, thin septa + narrow holes for lower energy

title: "Gastric varices"
---
Most gastric varices are formed by the left gastric (coronary) vein- near the cardia.
Usually shown big and dilated on angiogram.

Isolated gastric varices: secondary to splenic vein thrombosis

80-85% of gastric varices drain into inferior phrenic vein and then into left renal vein, forming gastrorenal shunt.

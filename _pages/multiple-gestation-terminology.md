Dizygotic: always dichorionic, diamniotic

Monozygotic (identical): placental varies depending on timing of fertilized ovum splitting&#8594; before 8 days = diamniotic, after 8 days = monoamniotic
The later the split, the worse the outcomes (monoamniotics have more problems)

Twin-peak sign: beak-like tongue between the 2 membranes of dichorionic diamniotic fetuses &#8594; excludes monochorionic pregnancy
T-sign: basically the absence of the twin-peak sign &#8594; don't see chorion between membrane layers &#8594; monochorionic pregnancy.

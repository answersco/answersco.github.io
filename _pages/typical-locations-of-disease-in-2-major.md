title: "Typical locations of disease in 2 major causes of renal artery occlusive disease"
---
Atherosclerosis: stenoses typically located within the first few centimeters of the origin of the renal artery.
-Most are ostial stenosis: within 1 cm of origin
-Proximal stenoses (&lt;10%): &gt; 1 cm from ostium
-Severe athero or longstanding HTN may result in disease of smaller intrarenal branches.
-Almost half of patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis also have a stenotic lesion in the opposite renal artery.

FMD (80% due to medial fibroplasia): usually located in distal main renal artery, and extends into the first order branches in 25%.
-1/2 have bilateral disease, with unilateral disease more common on the right.

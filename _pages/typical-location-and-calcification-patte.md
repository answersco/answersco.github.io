title: "Typical location and calcification pattern of pineal germinoma?"
---
Germinoma: most commonly occurs in pineal, sellar, or suprasellar region
Occasionally occurs off-midline, potentially in basal ganglia or thalamus
Pineal germinoma: typically engulfs the pineal gland and pineal calcification
Typically demonstrate uniform enhancement

Pineocytoma: &quot;explodes&quot; pineal calcifications
Pineoblastoma: associated with peripheral calcifications
Teratomas: associated with fat

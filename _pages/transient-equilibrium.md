title: "Transient equilibrium?"
---
If the parent half-life is longer than the child half-life but is not that long, the parent and child may be in transient equilibrium. In 99Mo --&gt; 99mTc --&gt; 99Tc, the peak time is about 24 hours. That is, we should extract 99mTc activity from the generator once a day at the same time.

This occurs when the DAUGHTER radionuclide t1/2 is much shorter than the PARENT t1/2
This typically occurs at approximately 4 daughter t1/2
(image shows transient equilibrium between Mo99/Tc99 - notice this occurs at approximately 24 hrs)

-GI protectant
-creates protective barrier on mucosa of GI tract
-protects against acid, pepsin, bile salts
-inhibits pepsin activity
-promotes healing
-needs to be given on empty stomach at least 2 hours before or after other meds
-do not crush and put in tubes like NG bc it creates a chalky and sticky substance that can clog tube so leave in cup of water, wait for it to dissolve, and it becomes a slurry and makes it easier to give

title: "Fertilization"
---
-sperm are chemically attracted to the oocyte
-when a sperm cell meets an oocyte, its acrosome bursts and releases enzymes that cut through -the oocyte's protective layer
sperm penetration triggers chemical and electrical changes in the oocyte's surface which block entry of other sperm (prevent polyspermy). 
-the two sets of chromosomes (pronuclei) meet and merge, forming a diploid zygota

title: "What are the levels of sedation/analgesia/anesthesia, and by whom are they defined?"
---
Levels of sedation are defined by the JC and the American Society of Anesthesiologists
1. Minimal sedation or anxiolysis (e.g. Valium): reduction of anxiety and drug-induced state where patient responds to verbal commands. 
Cognitive function/coordination may be impaired
Ventilatory and CV functions are unaffected.

2. Moderate sedation/analgesia: minimally depressed level of consciousness
Patient retains a continuous and independent ability to maintain protective reflexes and a patent airway
 Should be aroused by physical/verbal stimulations.

3. Deep sedation/analgesia: drug-induced depression of consciousness 
Patient cannot be easily aroused but responds purposefully after repeated or painful stimulation. 
Ability to maintain ventilatory function may be impaired. May require assistance in maintaining a patent airway, and spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate. 
CV function usually maintained.
Usually administered by anesthesiologists or nurse anesthetist, though some IRs can provide it with proper training.

4. General anesthesia: controlled state of unconsciousness
Complete loss of protective reflexes, including ability to maintain patent airway independently and respond to painful stimulation.

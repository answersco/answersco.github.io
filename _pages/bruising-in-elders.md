-80% of accidental bruising happens on the extremities

-look for clusters of bruising

-look for patterns such as &quot;appears to be a belt buckle&quot;

-bruises they get but keep appearing in the same place especially if it was a &quot;one time thing&quot;

-look for bruising on hips, wrists, face, neck, chest wall, back, abdomen (be careful if on heparin injections), and buttocks

-non-accidental bruising tends to be larger

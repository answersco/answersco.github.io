title: "Perc extraction of CBD stones through T-tube tract: pre-procedure evaluation"
---
If patient has a post-op T-tube in place, then ERCP is inappropriate because any retained stones can be removed easily through the percutaneous tract. 
-If stone removal through the T-tube tract is planned, the T-tube is left in situ for 4-6 weeks until a mature tract develops.
-Patient returns for stone removal with standard abx prophylaxis.
-T-tube cholangiogram performed to confirm that the stones are still present. If they are not present, the tube can be removed.

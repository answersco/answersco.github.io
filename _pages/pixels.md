title: "Pixels"

This is what determines your spatial resolution
Each pixel can be thought of as a recorded numerical value which represents the BRIGHTNESS level of the display
Pixels are in a matrix and the matrix size is VARIABLE (the more pixels in a matrix (assuming stable matrix size) means that the pixel size DECREASES
Pixels/unit area is referred to as PIXEL DENSITY. The higher the pixel density the BETTER the spatial resolution
Pixel Pitch: This is the distance from the center of one pixel to the adjacent pixel (more easily understood as pixel spacing)
1. Decreased pixel pitch gives HIGHER spatial resolution
It is important to note that the spatial resolution of film may still be better because you do not have to rely on pixels

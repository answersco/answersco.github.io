title: "C. Myocardial strain. This cine image uses a special modulation of magnetization to produce tag lines that move with the myocardium. The degree of deformation of the squares is used to calculate myocardial strain, which gives an accurate (sensitivity 92%, specificity 99%) quantitative assessment of myocardial function. A series of non-tagged short axis images can be used to measure ejection fraction, end-systolic volume and myocardial mass. Myocardial perfusion imaging uses gadolinium and adenosine."

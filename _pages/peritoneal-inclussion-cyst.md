title: "Peritoneal inclussion cyst"

- Think of this as SCAR around the ovary caused by some sort of peritoneal inflammation (PID, pelvic surgery, endometrioma)
- On imaging these are going to look like cystic masses that CONFORM to the surrounding structure. Additionally they will CONTAIN the ovary either centrally or peripherally

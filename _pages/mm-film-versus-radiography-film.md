title: "MM film versus radiography film:"
---
Mammography film has a higher gradient (&#8593; contrast) and higher maximum optical density (&#8593; dynamic range or latitude while maintaining high contrast) compared to general diagnostic film
Typically, general diagnostic film reaches a maximum optical density of anywhere between 3-3.5 OD
Mammography films can typically go up to 4-5 OD
Per ACR, the AEC (automatic exposure control) needs to maintain film optical density within 0.15 of the mean density

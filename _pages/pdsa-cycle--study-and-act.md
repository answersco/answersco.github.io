title: "PDSA cycle: study and act"
---
Study: determine how well your measure compared to the desired goal and explore root causes for lacking goal achievement.
Analyze baseline data and compare with both the predicted result and the desired performance target. 
Then summarize conclusions.
If results did meet the performance target, institute a plan to sustain the gain and to remeasure at appropriate intervals.
If results did not meet the performance target: determine the factors to which you attribute the results and examine all potential root causes.

Act: devise and implement a plan for performance improvement that addresses the perceived root cause for not achieving the performance target. Implement an improvement plan that you have developed before remeasurement.

After your improvement plan implementation, begin another PDSA cycle to assess the degree of any gain achieved.

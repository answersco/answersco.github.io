title: "CT: 1) hyperdense 2) avid homogeneous enhancement 3) Ca+ in 25% 4) surrounding variable edema - more at convexities due to compressive ischemia &amp; venous stasis 5) hyperostosis, cortical thickening &amp; inner table invasion 6) MC locations: parasagittal, convexities, CPA, olfactory groove, planum sphenoidale, cavernous sinus 7) may encase arteries (e.g. ICA in cavernous sinus) 8) MC tumor post radiation- more aggressive MR: 1) Iso T1, Mild Bright T2 2) encase vessels 3) dural tail (differ from 5th or 8th CN Schwannoma) 4) sinus invasion/thrombosis (*, transverse) Angio: 1) supplied by ECA - mostly from middle meningeal 2) may need ICA, ECA &amp; vert injections depending on location 2) &quot;mother in law sign&quot; = early homogeneous enhancement w/ prolonged vascular stain  Sx: rare &lt; 20 unless NF, MC extra-axial tumor  HEMANGIOPERICYTOMA: 1) flow voids from vessels w/i tumor 2) no hyperostosis or Ca+ 3) more narrow dural attachement 4) more lobulated"

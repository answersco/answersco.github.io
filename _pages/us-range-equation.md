Range Equation&#8594; D = (c x t) / 2
D = the depth at which the echo signal is formed
C = the speed of sound propagation
Average speed of sound in soft tissue = 1540 m/s
When sound propagation speed for a particular region &lt; 1540 m/s &#8594; the distance calculated by the system will be erroneously long
When sound speed is &gt; 1540 m/s &#8594; the distance shown by the imaging system will be erroneously short
t = time delay between the pulse emission and echo reception

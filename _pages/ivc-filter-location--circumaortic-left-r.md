title: "IVC filter location: circumaortic left renal vein, short IVC or thrombus in infrarenal IVC, duplicated IVC, mega cava"
---
Circumaortic L renal vein: place below or across the lower, retroaortic component.

Insufficient space below renal veins due to short IVC or thrombus: place filter between renal and hepatic veins (suprarenal placement)
-Bird's nest filter shouldn't be placed suprarenal because the mesh often prolapses during deployment and can extend into heart.

Duplicated IVC: filter in each IVC or single suprarenal filter.

Mega cava (diameter &gt; 28-30 mm): can use Vena Tech off label up to 35 mm, or Bird's nest up to 40 mm.

Radiocapitellar line: This is a line through the center of the radius that should intersect the center of the capitellum on ALL views. If this is not the case, then the radius is dislocated.

Anterior humeral line: Need to be in a TRUE LATERAL. Line should pass through the anterior third of the capitellum. If this line passes through the MIDDLE third of the capitellum then start thinking of SUPRACONDYLAR FRACTURE.

Most common peds elbows fractures: supracondylar (60%) &gt; lateral condyle (20%) &gt; medial epicondyle (10%)

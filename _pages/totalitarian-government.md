title: "Totalitarian government"
---
a state characterized by government control over all aspects of economic, social, political, cultural, and intellectual life, the subordination of the individual to the state, and the insistence that the masses be actively involved in the regime's goals; a system of rule in which the government recognizes no formal limits on its power and seeks to absorb or eliminate other social institutions that might challenge it (ideologically such governments may be on the communistic left or fascistic right)

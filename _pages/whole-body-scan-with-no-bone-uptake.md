title: "Whole body scan with no bone uptake."

No bones + heart + kidneys = MIBI

No bones + heart, no renal uptake = MIBG

No bones + no heart + liver = MIBG 

No bones + no heart and no hepatic uptake = iodine

MIBG cardiac uptake is variable, but more common when using I-123 than I-131

Any bone uptake on MIBI, I-131, or octreotide is abnormal, and worrisome for mets.

-stack of flat membrane-enclosed sacs
-processing center 
1) final protein folding (can cause mutation if not propoerly folded)
2) adds sugars to form glycoproteins and glycolipids 
-products released in vesicles that bud off

-receives transport vesicles with proteins (arrive at cis face and leave trans face)
-modify proteins
-glycate them
-sort, package for delivery
-can be used to manufacture lysosomes/peroxisomes, or send vesicles to lipid membrane
-vesicles are like semi-trucks to take proteins to places
-finished protein is always different than original

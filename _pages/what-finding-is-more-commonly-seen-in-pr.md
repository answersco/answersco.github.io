title: "What finding is more commonly seen in primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy than in secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HOA)?"
---
Answer: phalangeal tuft acro-osteolysis
Primary HOA is also konwn as pachydermoperiostosis.
Secondary makes up 97% of HOA, most commonly secondary to malignancy (90%).

Involvement of the tufts is not common in either primary or secondary cases. But when it does occur, acroosteolysis is more commonly associated with primary HOA, while tuft hypertrophy is more common in secondary HOA.

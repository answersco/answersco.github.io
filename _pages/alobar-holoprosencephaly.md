title: "Alobar holoprosencephaly?"
---
Most severe type. Leads to fused thalami, single monoventricle which may communicate with a large dorsal cyst. Brain surrounds monoventricle giving a bommerang shape.

Poor prognosis. Anterior rind of brain tissue and monoventricle communicating with dorsal cyst. Fused thalami. Absent septum pellucidum, corpus callosum, and falx. Upside-down U-shaped mantle of brain tissue. Ends of U are hippocampal ridges.

the most severe form of holoprosencephaly
There is ONE, LARGE VENTRICLE with fusion of the thalami and basal ganglia 
NO FALX, NO Corpus collosum
NOTE: You DO have a cortical mantle (this is how you distinguish from hydranencephaly)

Big single ventricle with ABSENT falx (vs hydranencephaly with present falx). Corticle mantle is present

Absent falx, fused midline structures

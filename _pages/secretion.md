title: "Secretion"
---
-secretions of the GI tract aid in movement and facilitate digestion and absorption
1) saliva and mucus in mouth aid in digestion and motility
2) stomach: gastrin plays important role in muscle contraction and release of pepsin and HCL- 
-gastrin stimulates the parietal cells to excrete HCl-, and the chief cells to release pepsin
-to maintain acid at appropriate levels, there is a negative feedback system between acid and gastrin. As levels of acid increase, levels of gastrin decrease
3) small intestine: secretin is released and stimulates pancreas to secrete bicarbonate and other pancreatic enzymes
4) gallbladder: releases bile

-if it moves toward the tubule, it's being secreted
-on an as needed basis when levels get too high
-primarily urea/uric acid/ammonia
-H+
-some K+

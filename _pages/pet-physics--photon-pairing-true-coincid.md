title: "PET physics (photon pairing TRUE COINCIDENCE)"
---
Photons are considered a pair if they: 

1. Stay within a present energy window (FWHM = full width half maximum) 25-30%
2. Stay within the appropriate timing window

If both of these happen, then it is considered as though the event occurred along a line of response LOR i.e. TRUE COINCIDENCE

title: "US, CT, and venography findings of IVC obstruction"
---
Duplex US: stasis of flow, loss of normal respiratory variation, or thrombosis of iliofemoral veins bilaterally.
-Blunted or absent response to Valsalva is suggestive of central occlusion when present bilaterally.

CT: expansion of IVC implies intrinsic occlusion
-High-attenuation material in IVC on NECT can be seen with acute thrombus.
-Enhancement of IVC wall with a low-attenuation lumen after administration of CM is diagnostic of intrinsic occlusion (typically bland thrombus).
-Contrast may be seen around an intraluminal filling defect at proximal and distal extent of occlusion or with incomplete obstruction
-Intraluminal tumor may enhance with CM.

Cavography:
-Intraluminal occlusions have characteristic appearance of contrast on both sides of filling defect
-Extrinsic compression causes broadening or effacement of lumen.

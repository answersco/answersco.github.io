title: "Dampening block: thick versus thin"
---
Dampening block: dampens the transducer vibration to create a pulse with a short spatial pulse length &#8594; needed to preserve detail along the beam axis (axial resolution)

Thin block = &quot;low-damping&quot; = high Q
Creates a narrow bandwidth &#224; used in Doppler to preserve velocity information.
Long spatial pulse length

Thick block = &quot;heavy damping&quot; = low Q
Broad bandwidth
Short spatial pulse length &#8594; high spatial (axial) resolution (fewer interference effects and thus more uniformity)

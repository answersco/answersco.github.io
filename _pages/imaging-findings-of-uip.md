title: "Imaging findings of UIP:"
---
Early UIP: features irregular reticulation in the posterior subpleural lung bases
Later stages: reticulation becomes fibrosis, traction bronchiectasis develops, and posterior subpleural honeycombing becomes prominent
Lung bases are most severely affected
CT diagnosis of late UIP is very specific based on these findings, in particular the presence and posterior basal location of honeycombing.

CT: most common finding (in addition to adenopathy) is upper-lobe predominant perilymphatic nodules of variable sizes (represent granulomas)
Perilymphatic nodules: peribronchovascular, subpleural, and within the interlobular septa.
May coalesce into a mass up to several cm in diameter
Galaxy sign: seen when small nodules are peripheral to a confluent mass.
Miliary pattern of nodules may also be present
Ground-glass may be seen superimposed on perilymphatic nodules
Bronchial involvement: may cause mosaic perfusion due to air-trapping
May involve spleen, brain, and bone.

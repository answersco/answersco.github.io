title: "ACE inhibitor renogram"
---
renal artery stenosis- hypertension (renin to AgI to Ag II to constrict efferent arterioles to restore GFR)
ACE : Ag I to II
ACE inhibitor (captopril 25-50 mg) - efferents relax and GFR decreases
Tc 99m MAG3 (tubular)- uptake/secretion preserved but less washout of agent 
DTPA (glomerular)- dec uptake and excretion

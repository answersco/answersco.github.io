title: "Look at the Heart in CXR"
---
Assess the grayness of heart muscle either side of the vertebral bodies. By adjusting the contrast or brightness of the film you might be able to spot a difference in the density of the two areas projected over the heart muscle lateral to the vertebral body, indicating a hidden patch of consolidation. The heart on a PA film should be less than half the total chest diameter at its largest point&#8212;if it is bigger than this cardiomegaly secondary to heart failure might be indicated. The cardiophrenic angles (formed by the intersection of the heart borders with the medial end of the hemidiaphragms) should be clear and could be deformed by cysts or solid masses. Areas of hazy opacity abutting the cardiophrenic angles are occasionally present. This can correspond to cardiac fat pads, especially in a population where obesity is increasing

title: "Gas transport and exchange"
---
-inspired = 1 atmosphere: high Po2 and low Pco2
-lowest O2 in alveolis where consumed
-highest CO2 in alveolis where produced
-not all CO2 expired -- mixing of gases prevents complete O2/CO2 swap; but, Pco2 always dropping as you move from veins to alveoli in expiration, so CO2 keeps moving out instead of in
-if O2 is always going to move from high pressure to low pressure gradient, O2 is constantly going to go this way ---- the partial pressure continuing to lower
-cellular respiration promotes systemic gas exchange -- absorbing O2, metabolic glucose, and produce CO2

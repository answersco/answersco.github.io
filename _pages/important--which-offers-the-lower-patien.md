title: "IMPORTANT: Which offers the lower patient dose in CXR at 120 kV? Photoconductor (selenium), Scintillator (CsI), photostimulable phosphor (BaFBr), or Ionization chamber (Xe)?"

CsI will absorb most of the incident XRs generated at 120 kV so don't need as high a dose (mA and kV) to get the same image as the others.

title: "IR intervention in pulmonary AVMs"
---
The majority of simple and complex pulmonary AVMs are treated with embo.
-Previously only AVMs with feeding arteries &gt;/= 3 mm were embolized because these were thought to be most likely to permit paradoxical emboli.
-Currently any AVM that can be catheterized is treated.
-Intended site of occlusion is the feeding artery, not the actual fistula or the outflow vein.
-Occlusion can be accomplished with coils or detachable plus, with diameter at least 20% larger than target vessel to avoid becoming paradoxical emboli themselves.
-Coils or plugs should be deposited distal to proximal until there is no further filling of the shunt.
-Recanalization occurs in up to 20%, requiring lifelong follow-up.

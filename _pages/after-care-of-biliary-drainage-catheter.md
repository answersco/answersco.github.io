title: "After care of biliary drainage catheter"

Correct catheter fixation to skin is important:
-Especially for right-sided catheter, if it is tied too tightly at skin entry site, the catheter is not free to move with the liver as the patient breaths, and tends to back out of the liver with breathing, forming a loop between the liver capsule and the abdominal wall.
-This can lead to drainage problems such as backbleeding through the catheter if a side-hole migrates back into the liver and communicates with a vein.
-Side-hole may also migrate outside of liver and communicate with pleural space or abdominal cavity, causing bile leak.
-To avoid these problems, allow ~ 2 cm of slack in the catheter when suturing it to the skin.

Catheter irrigated with saline every 6 hours for first 48 hours.
-Kept on zosyn tid for 2-3 days, and maintain IV fluids.

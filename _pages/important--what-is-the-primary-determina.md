title: "IMPORTANT: What is the primary determinant of noise in MR imaging? What else contributes?"
---
Primary = Receiver bandwidth (the range of frequencies used to sample the echo; as rBW widens, more noise is picked up so SNR drops)

* As the sensitive volume of a coil increases (e.g. a body coil is larger), then the noise also increases (local and surface coils result in decreased noise)

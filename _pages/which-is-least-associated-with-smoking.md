title: "Which is LEAST associated with smoking? (RB-ILD, Desquamative ILD, Bronchiolitis obliterans, or LCH)?"

Bronchiolitis Obliterans! (this is NOT assoc with smoking; it's a constrictive bronchiolitis in post lung transplant GVHD, drug reactions (penicillamine), and rheumatoid arthritis!)

The other 3 definitely are assoc with smoking!

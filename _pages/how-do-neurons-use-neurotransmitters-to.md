title: "How do neurons use neurotransmitters to communicate with each other and with the body?"
---
-Neurons have dendrites, which receive input, a soma or cell body, and axons, which carry the neural message to other cells.

-Myelin insulates and protects the axons of neurons that travel in the body. These axons bundle together in &quot;cables&quot; called nerves. Myelin also speeds up the neural message.

-A neuron contains charged particles called ions. When at rest, the neuron is negatively charged on the inside and positively charged on the outside. When stimulated, this reverses the charge by allowing positive sodium ions to enter the cell. This is the action potential.

-Neurons fire in an all-or-nothing manner. It is the speed and number of neurons firing that tell researchers the strength of the stimulus.

-Synaptic vesicles in the end of the axon terminal release neurotransmitter chemicals into the synapse, or gap, between one cell and the next. The neurotransmitter molecules fit into receptor sites on the next cell, stimulating or inhibiting that cell's firing. Neurotransmitters may be either excitatory or inhibitory.

title: "Collectivization"
---
The process seen in the Soviet Union and Communist China to form communal work units for agriculture and manufacturing--from private hands to large, collective, government operations.

Creation of large, state-run farms rather than individual holdings; allowed more efficient control over peasants; part of Stalin's economic and political planning; often adopted in other Communist regimes.

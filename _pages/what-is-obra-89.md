title: "What is OBRA 89?"
---
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA 89): enacted Medicare physician payment reform provisions into law, calling for a payment schedule based on an RBRVS (resource-based relative value scale) composed of the following 3 components: the relative physician work involved in providing a service, practice expenses, and professional liability insurance (PLI) costs. The practice expenses include GPCI (geographic practice cost indicator).

OBRA 89 provisions that were adopted authorized Congress to annually update the conversion factor based on the percentage increase in the MEI (Medicare Economic Index), a comparison of the MVPS (Medicare Volume Performance Standard) with the actual increase in spending, and other factors. The MVPS is set annually to reflect the expected growth rate in Medicare spending for physicians' services. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 replaced the MVPS with the sustainable growth rate (SGR) system to control Medicare expenditure growth.

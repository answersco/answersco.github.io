Adenoid cystic carcinoma: perineural spread

Lymphoma: associated with Sjogrens (usually NHL MALT lymphoma)
Bilateral, often homogeneous masses
-Parotid is only salivary gland with lymph nodes, so you can get primary or secondary lymphoma.

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma, in comparison, is more likely than ACC to be cystic and have high T2 signal.

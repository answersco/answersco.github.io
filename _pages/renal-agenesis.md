title: "Renal Agenesis"
---
Can be unilateral or bilateral
THINK about associated GYN/Testes abnormalities, these happen on the IPSILATERAL SIDE
For women: think unicornuate uterus
For guys: think absence of the epididymis or semincal vesicle or a sem vesicle cyst 

Also think about POTTER sequence if both kidneys are goine
- this can be caused by ACE inhibitor 

Also think about the PANCAKE adrenal - this is where the adrenal does not form correctly because it is not molded by the kidney

Two types:
1. Bilateral renal agenesis: Potter sequence related
2. 1 kidney absent: Reproductive associations

Single kidney:
- Look for absence of the renal artery on prenatal ultrasound OR oligohydramnios 
- 70% women with unilateral agenesis have genital abnormalities most common being UNICORNUATE uterus or RUDIMENTARY horn
- 20% of men are missing the epididymis and vas deferen on the SAME SIDE as the kidey (may also have a seminal vesicle cyst)

Both kidneys missing:
- Associated w/ potter sequence (may be related to ACEi), remember if the kidneys dont form and you have oligohydramnios, this leads to pulmonary hypoplasia

title: "Tumors showing I-131 MIBG uptake"
---
Paraganglioma (75%)
Pheo (75-100%)
Carcinoid (70%)
Medullary thyroid cancer (10%)

I-123 better because better image quality
I-131 cheaper, and long half-life allows for delayed imaging.

MIBG: 1st line for pheo, paraganglioma, and neuroblastoma.
Better than MDP for neuroblastoma bone mets
If you see skeleton on MIBG, answer is diffuse bone mets.

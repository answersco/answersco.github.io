FV: extends from groin (where it is joined by the PFV) to the adductor canal (becomes popliteal vein)
-FV lies slightly deep and lateral to SFA in the thigh.
-Duplicated or complex in up to 20%.

PFV: runs alongside PFA, draining the same muscles supplied by the artery.
-In 50%, the PFV communicates directly with popliteal vein at the level of the adductor canal.

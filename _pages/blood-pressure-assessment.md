1) position cuff on the arm at the level of the heart
2) choose the appropriate cuff size
-if cuff is too narrow &#8594; false high reading
-if cuff is too wide &#8594; false low reading
-the bladder length should cover 80-100% of the circumference of the upper arm
-the bladder width should be approximately 45% of the circumference of the arm
3) inflate the cuff 30 mmHg beyond a patient's typical systolic pressure or the point at which the pulse disappeared on palpation
4) inflate and deflate the cuff at a steady, moderate rate (about 2-3 mmHg/sec)
5) wait 2 minutes before repeating a blood pressure assessment

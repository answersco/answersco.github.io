Venography should include both cavography and selective hepatic venography.
Pigtail catheter positioned in infrahepatic IVC: injection of 20-25 mL for total volume of 40-50 mL.

-Intrahepatic IVC frequently narrowed due to compression by swollen liver parenchyma.
-Hepatic venous inflow may be absent when the level of obstruction is at the hepatic veins.
-Obstructing webs may be seen in suprahepatic IVC.
-Classic venographic appearance of HVs: small vessel thrombosis creating a spiderweb-like network of small, unnamed collateral and recanalized veins draining directly into IVC. 
-May also see HV stenoses or webs.

title: "Partial volume and methods to correct it"

Partial Volume: can occur in 2 main ways
Pattern 1: Partial volume effect
A dense object protrudes partially into the width of an x-ray beam
Results in divergence of the beam &#8594; manifests as shading artifacts adjacent to the object.

Pattern 2: 
CT voxels are 3D cubes. If you have a dense thing taking up &#189; the cube and a low-attenuating object in the other half, the machine will average them together&#8594; intermediate density
Classic location is skull base averaging with CSF or brain&#8594; looks a little like blood

Fixing partial volume:
Make slices thinner
If noise is a problem, acquire thin slices then generate thicker slices by adding them together

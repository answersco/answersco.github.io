title: "What is the principal behind TOF?"
---
GRE sequence that requires the longitudinal mag of the flowing blood to be different from the longitudinal mag of the stationary tissues

Saturate stationary tissues with short TR (longitudinal mag does not have time to recover). Therefore, Fresh Blood entering a slice (i.e. NOT SATURATED) results in higher signal
- Requires selection of a slice perpendicular to the vessel
- Venous and arterial flow can be selected using saturation pulses either ABOVE or Below the slice of interest
- Faster than Phase contrast
- Signal loss because of turbulent or slow flow

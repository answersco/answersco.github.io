title: "Spatial resolution vs magnification (Fluoro)"
---
For electronic magnification (zoom): cutting the input field in half HOWEVER the OUTPUT field always remains the same size therefore the object has undergone 2X magnification and therefore 2X increase in spatial resolution

Note: 1/2 input field = 1/4 of the image brightness therefore ABC kicks in and increases dose THEREFORE input radiation has to be increased 4X

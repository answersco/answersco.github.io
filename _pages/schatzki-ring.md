title: "Schatzki ring?"
---
Pathologic B-ring that can result in dysphagia (inflamed B-ring from reflux).

Schatzki ring: focal narrowing of the B (mucosal) ring of the distal esophagus, causing intermittent dysphagia
True Schatzki ring: requires clinical symptoms of dysphagia in addition to esophageal narrowing on imaging
Asymptomatic narrowing of the B ring: referred to as a lower esophageal ring
UGI (more sensitive than endoscopy): shows focal circumferential constriction near the GEJx, almost always associated with hiatal hernia.
Most symptomatic rings do not allow passage of a 12 mm tablet

Schatzki ring = symptomatic narrowing of the B ring
A ring above the vestibule; B ring below the vestibule. Hiatal hernia would be just below the B ring.
&quot;Schatz-B ring&quot;

Z-line = squamocolumnar junction.

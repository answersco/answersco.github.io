---
Patients with progressive liver disease despite systemic therapy may benefit from liver-directed therapy, including bland embo, TACE, DEBs, and Y-90.
All patients with neuroendocrine tumors should receive 500 ug of octreotide either SC or IV at least 20 minutes before angio or embo. May require a drip for hx of carcinoid crisis.

-TACE: 3 druge regimen preferred (cisplatinum, mitomycin C, and doxorubicin)
-DEBs: usually loaded with doxorubicin
-Y-90: same as for HCC and CRC.

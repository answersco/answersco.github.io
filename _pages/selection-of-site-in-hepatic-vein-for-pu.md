title: "Selection of site in hepatic vein for puncture of portal vein"
---
Typically, initiating punctures within 2-4 cm of the HV orifice is sufficient for TIPS creation.

Peripheral starting point: risks entry into peripheral portal branches or extracapsular puncture of the liver.
-Can also be difficult to maneuver devices in small portal branches with sharp angles.

Too central in hepatic vein: may result in puncture of the extrahepatic main portal vein, which can result in intraperitoneal hemorrhage.

Facial nerve canal
The facial nerve is seen in the internal auditory canal and entering the temporal bone (medial white arrow).
The lateral white arrow represents the tympanic segment of the facial nerve running in the facial canal and curving around the oval window niche. 
At this point, the nerve runs in a horizontal plane in a posterior direction superiorly to the oval window . 
The incus (orange arrow) is seen connecting to the stapes (blue arrow).

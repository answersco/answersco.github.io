title: "What signs and symptoms are most commonly associated with naso-orbital-ethmoidal (NOE) fractures?"
---
Midface retrusion, telecanthus, and epiphora.

NOE fracture: fracture complex involving the confluence of the medial and upper maxillary buttresses and their posterior extensions. Involves disruption of the medial canthal regions, ethmoids, and medial orbital walls.

Midface retrusion (state of being located posterior to the normal position): due to depression of the nasal bridge.
Traumatic telecanthus (increased distance between the medial canthi of the eyes with normal interpupillary distance): may occur due to injury to the region of the medial canthal tendon insertion.
Epiphora (excessive tearing): related to injury to the lacrimal canaliculi, lacrimal sac, or nasolacrimal duct.

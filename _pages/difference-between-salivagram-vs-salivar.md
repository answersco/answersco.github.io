title: "Difference between salivagram vs salivary gland scintigraphy?"
---
Salivagram is used to determine aspiration of pharyngeal contents (can tell you level of penetration in tracheobronchial tree)

Salivary sciagraphy evals the parenchymal and excretory function of salivary glands (e.g. look for sialadenitis and tumors)

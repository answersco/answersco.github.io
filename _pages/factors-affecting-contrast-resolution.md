Contrast Resolution: the ability to discriminate small differences in object density from its surroundings for a specific target size and radiation dose (noise)

Dose:
As the # of x-ray photons &#8593;, the signal detected &#8593; &#8594; &#8593; contrast resolution
But radiation dose &#8593; in proportion to photon flux

Quantum Noise: directly dependent on the # of x-ray photons
As the # of x-ray photons doubles &#8594; signal &#8593; by a factor of 2, and noise &#8593; by a factor of &#8730;2

SNR: contrast resolution improves with SNR
If the # of x-ray photons is doubled, the signal doubles, and the noise &#8593; by a factor of &#8730;2 &#8594; SNR &#8593; by 2/&#8730;2
Thus, as signal (and proportionately the dose) &#8593;, the contrast resolution also &#8593;, but at a lesser rate.

Slice thickness:
Small slices = fewer photons per slice &#8594; less contrast resolution (image is noisier)
But smaller slices = less partial volume averaging&#8594; improved spatial resolution

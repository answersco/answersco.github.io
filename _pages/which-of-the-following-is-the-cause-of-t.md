title: "Which of the following is the cause of the high signal indicated by the arrows on this contrast-enhanced T1 fat-saturation image?"
---
This artifact is called signal flares related to contact between the skin and coil elements and associated focally inhomogeneous fat suppression. Signal flare will be present on pre-contrast images and occurs in typical locations (skin and subcutaneous tissues, especially inframammary fold) usually in patients with large breasts. This artifact is important because detection of tissue enhancement is more difficult against a high signal background.

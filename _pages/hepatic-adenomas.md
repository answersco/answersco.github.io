title: "Hepatic adenomas"

This **** boys are going to contain microscopic fat so you may see signal drop out on in/out phase imaging
Imaging characteristics make these difficult to distinguish from HCC as they can be relatively T2 hyper and have early arterial enhancement HOWEVER they do not have washout, they basically get to background liver intensity
- Work up: STOP OCP's and reimage as these things should get smaller
- Management: &lt;5 cm watch, &gt; 5cm consider resection as they can cause massive hemorrhage 

Pearls:
- If you see MULTIPLE adenomas think about a glycogen storage disease or liver adenomatosis

title: "MA"
---
milliampere, this is a current measurement which means that it is related to the QUANTITY of electrons moving from cathode to anode 
See below picture for important facts about mA 
Note: mA is a direct relationship with the number of electrons moving, i.e., an electron stream with @ mA of 100 has 2X the electrons of an electron stream with mA = 50
Note: the mA changes the QUANTITY of an electron beam, but does NOT change the quality

RCC: Hypervascular renal cortical mass, usually solid, round, focal &#177; hemorrhage or necrosis, but may be cystic, unilocular or multilocular. M&gt;F 2:1. Middle aged. Assoc with VHL.

Mixed attenuation, containing fat. Non-invasive; projects into perirenal space. Female predominance. Assoc with TS.

Large and homogeneous, Indistinguishable from RCC. Although a central stellate scar is typical.

Multicystic with thick, enhancing septa, Cysts may herniate into renal pelvis. Two age peaks, infants/toddlers male predominant and adult female predominant.

Symmetrical areas of Ao or branch vessel circumferential narrowing due to wall thickening. May be segmental and regions of aneurysm. on CE MRI wall enhancement = active dz. PET + means active dz. Ao 75%, L SA 55%; R SA 38%; L CCA 30%; R CCA 15%; Renal 38%; coronary 15%.

US: shows enlarged and heterogeneous uterus

MRI:
- thickening of the junctional zone of the endometrium to &gt; 12 mm (normal is &lt;5mm)
- small T2 bright (cystic) regions in endometrium

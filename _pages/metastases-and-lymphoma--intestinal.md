Intestinal metastases
Malignant melanoma is most common primary site
Enhancing masses within SB mesentery and bowel wall
Bull's-eye or &quot;target&quot; lesions; intussusception
Lung and breast carcinoma metastases
Are scirrhous tumors
Likely to cause luminal obstruction
Intraperitoneal metastatic spread (e.g., from ovarian and GI primary tumors)
Serosal metastases cause clustered adhesion and fixation of SB loops and functional obstruction
Direct invasion (e.g., from pancreatic or GYN tumor)
Lumen of affected SB is often narrowed or obstructed
Intestinal lymphoma
Circumferential type: Sausage-shaped mass(es)
Rarely obstructs; may cause aneurysmal dilation
Polypoid form: Bull's-eye or &quot;target&quot; lesions
Mesenteric form: SB masses and nodes 
CT enterography is best protocol, with multiplanar reformation

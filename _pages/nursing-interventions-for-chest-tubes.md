1) Must be one way system to allow air or fluid out of cavity and none back in

2) Keep below level of chest (40 cm or more)

3) Site assessment: 
-Check integrity of dressing - Vaseline gauze/ occlusive dressing 
-Subcutaneous emphysema (crepitus) - lightly palpate outside edge of where chest tube is coming out
-Do not want to feel subQ emphysema and if you are feeling that, then it means air Is leaking into the surrounding tissues
-Tubes in place by sutures - like a string backpack

4) **Pain Control:
-Chest tube put through muscles and nerves
-Every time they breathe the tube is moving, the ribs are moving
-Imperative they are well-medicated

title: "Kidneys"
---
each day, kidneys reduce 180 L of glomerular filtrate to 1 or 2 L of urine
-two-thirds of water in filtrate is reabsorbed in PCT
-reabsorption of solutes makes the tubule cells and tissue fluid hypertonic to tubular fluid
-water follows solutes by osmosis through both paracellular and transcellular routes 
-transcellularly, water uses channels called aquaporins

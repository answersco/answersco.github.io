title: "Doppler Angle"
---
Idea 30-60. 
Cos 60 - 0.5, Cos 0 - 1 and cos 90 = 0
when perpendicular no flow
&gt; 60 low signal
&lt;20 excess refraction

Doppler shift &#8594; inversely related to the angle of the transmitted sound beam relative to the long axis of the blood vessel.
Preferred Doppler angle &#8594; ranges from 30-60 degrees.
At angles &gt; 60 degrees &#8594; the Doppler shift is small &#8594; results in a low signal&#8594; minor errors in angle accuracy can magnify errors in velocity.
At angles &lt; 20 degrees&#8594; refraction causes loss of signal, and aliasing becomes an important problem.
If the US beam is perpendicular to the vessel &#8594; it may give a false impression of no flow (occlusion), or may create a mirror image.

Should be less than 60 degress
Remember that the strength of doppler follows the cosine of the angle

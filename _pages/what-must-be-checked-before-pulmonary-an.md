title: "What must be checked before pulmonary angiography? What are normal right-sided pressures?"
---
Before procedure, EKG must be evaluated to exclude a LBBB
If PA catheter were to cause temporary RBBB in the presence of LBBB, the lack of left-sided conduction may cause complete heart block, which can be fatal.
If LBBB is present, a pacer should be placed prior to pulmonary angiography.
Normal right-sided pressures:
RA: 0-8 mmHg
RV: 0-8 mmHg diastolic; 15-30 mmHg systolic
Pulmonary artery: 3-12 mmHg diastolic; 15-30 mmHg systolic.

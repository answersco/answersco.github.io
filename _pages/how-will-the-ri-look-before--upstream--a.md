title: "How will the RI look before (upstream) and after (downstreaM) a stenosis?"
---
Upstream RI is high &gt; 0.7 because blood needs to overcome the area of stenosis

Downstream RI is low &lt; 0.5 because the organ is starved for blood there

At stenosis itself, you get elevated PSV and spectral broadening

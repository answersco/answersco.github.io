title: "Chemical shift artifact:"
---
Chemical Shift Artifact&#8594; appears as a bright or black band at the interfaces of fatty tissue surrounded by non-fatty tissue.
The bright band will present on one side of the fatty tissue; the black band will present on the opposite side.
The bands line up along the frequency-encode direction.
The artifact may &#8595; the contrast between abnormal lesions and normal tissue, thus &#8595; the diagnostic yield of the study.
Origin&#8594; different resonant frequency of fat mimics frequency-encoding.
Method to lessen the effect&#8594; invert the phase-encode and frequency-encode directions.
&#8593; the bandwidth (Type 1)
For short TE sequences, change TE such that fat and water are mostly in phase (Type 2).
Lengthen TE such that it is greater than ~ 30 msec, and apply shimming over the FOV (Type 2).

Type 2 (india ink)-Occurs because Fat and Water precess at different frequencies and cancel (cycle 4.5ms at 1.5T - oop at 2.25 ms)
Type 1-Chemical shift misregistration artifact manifests as bright or dark outlines predominantly at fat / water interfaces
Primarily occurs along the FREQUENCY AXIS 
FIX: INCREASE R-BW - type 1
FIX type 2: change TE so In phase or longer TE &gt; 30 ms and apply shimming

Appears as a bright or black band at the interfaces of fatty tissue surrounded by non-fatty tissue. The bright band will present on one side of the fatty tissue and the black band will present on the opposite side.
Origin: Different resonant frequency of fat mimics frequency-encoding.
Direction: FREQUENCY ENCODE DIRECTION! TYPE 1.
Solution: Invert the phase-encode and frequency-encode directions to view the pathology better.

Occurs along the frequency encoding gradient 
Note: this is going to happen with a spin echo sequence as well as a gradient echo sequence

Seen at fat/tissue interfaces
India ink - when water and fat are in the same voxel
Lines - dark line and white line around a fat containing lesion

VHL: AD syndrome caused by mutation of VHL tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 3&#8594; cysts and neoplasms in multiple organs
Bilateral or multifocal RCC, most commonly clear-cell
May also have multifocal pheochromocytomas and renal cysts
CNS: hemangioblastoma of brainstem, cerebellum, or spinal cord
Pancreatic and hepatic manifestations; include pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, serous cystadenoma, and cysts.

Bird-Hogg-Dube: AD syndrome with dermatologic lesions, cystic lung disease
Includes multiple RCCs and oncocytomas

Tuberous sclerosis (TS): AD neurocutaneous disease presenting as seizures, developmental delay, and (mostly) benign tumors in multiple organ systems
Most common renal manifestation: multiple bilateral AMLs
25% with renal cysts
Increased risk of RCC
Cardiac rhabdomyomas
Lung: smooth muscle proliferation identical to LAM, with cystic replacement of lung parenchyma

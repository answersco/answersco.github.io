Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
Contrast resolution improves (&#8593;) with the SNR, defined as N/&#963;
As the # of x-ray photons is doubled, SNR &#8593; by a factor of &#8730;2 (2/&#8730;2)
Thus, as the signal (and proportionately the dose) &#8593; &#8594; contrast resolution &#8593;, but at a lesser rate
Visibility of low-contrast objects improves as mAs &#8593;

SNR ~ voxel volume x sqrt(NEX/receiver bandwidth)

Increased with:
- stronger magnet
- larger voxels
-- (thicker slices)
-- (decreased (shallow) slice selection gradient)
-- (increased transmit bandwidth)
-- (larger FOV)
-- (smaller matrix)
- more NEX (by square root)
- more slices in 3D (by square root - similar to NEX)
- narrow receiver bandwidth (by square root) (decreased noise but increased artifacts)
- smaller surface coils
- long TR (proton density)
- short TE (proton density)

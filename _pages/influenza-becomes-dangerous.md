title: "Influenza becomes dangerous"
---
1) can infect several species: virulence usually different among species --- typical pig virus could be more serious than a typical human one
2) viruses can change by mutation (antigenic drift) and recombination of RNA from other influenza strains (antigenic shift) due to simultaneous infections of two different strains in same host &amp;&amp; can come about when a host gets two different viruses so the host creates this combined virus - also called coinfection
Outcome: infect new species and becomes more virulent

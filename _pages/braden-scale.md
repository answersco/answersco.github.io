title: "Braden scale"
---
-use when needing to predict pt's risk for pressure ulcers
-it is the nurses job to watch and maintain pt's skin integrity
-a big safety issue so it is very important: it is considered nursing negligence if pt gets pressure ulcer
-frequently observe bed-bound pt's (and even those who are not bed-bound)
-bedsores occur from long-time pressure and low mobility
-usually a small affected area of tissue necrosis
-soft tissue is compressed b/w bony prominence and an external surface for a prolonged period of time
-scores ranges from 6 to 23: the lower the score, the higher the risk of a pt's getting a pressure ulcer
-score is determined by sensory perception, moisture, activity, mobility, nutrition, and friction &amp; shear
-to reduce risk: T/P q2h, keep pt dry, using special mattress, special lotions as a protectant

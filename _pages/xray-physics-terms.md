title: "XRAY physics terms"

KvP: think about this as water pressure pushing water out of a pipe but for electrons. The KvP actually represents the PEAK kilovoltage. This system of all electrons moving is non-uniform so setting to 100 KvP basically means the fastest electron is moving at 100 KvP.

KeV: This describes the energy of a SINGLE electron within an electron beam

Max energy xray = max KvP. You CANNOT have an xray with a higher keV than your KvP. 
Lowest energy xray is going to be determined by what filter you use. 

KvP manipulation trivia:
1. Below 69.5 kVp = zero k shell charactersitic x-rays
2. Between 80-150 kVp = 10-25% K shell characterstic xrays
3. Between 150-300 = progressive decrease in contribution
Above 300 = negligible contribution 

Larger Z = more overall xrays produced via bremsstraglung. This is a change in QUANTITY
Larger Z = difference characteristic energy peaks (NO change in the number produced via ionization) this is a change in QUALITY

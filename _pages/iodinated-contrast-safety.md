1. low osmolality contrast-&gt;incidence of reactions is 0.2-0.7%

2. incidence of severe reactions is 0.01-0.02%

3.<b> ACR goals for contrast administration:</b>
-assure administration is appropriate for patient and indication
-minimize likelihood of a contrast reaction
-be prepared to treat a reaction

4. <b>Pre-screening for IV contrast:</b>
-greatest risk factor for a reaction is a history of prior reaction 5 x increased risk of subsequent reaction
-Atopy hx (anaphylactic reaction in past) : 2-3 x increased risk
-Asthma history: may also increase the risk of contrast reaction

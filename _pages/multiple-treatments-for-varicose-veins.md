title: "Multiple treatments for varicose veins"
---
Endovenous ablation, sclerotherapy, and phlebectomy are complimentary techniques.
-2/3 who undergo treatment of varicose veins require some combination of these techniques to achieve best results.
-When ablation of saphenous vein is combined with sclero or phlebectomy of a few varices, these procedures can be performed at the same time.
-For saphenous vein reflux + extensive varices, endovenous ablation of saphenous vein performed first, and sclerotherapy/phlebectomy after 3-4 weeks due to common decrease in size and number of varices that require treatment.

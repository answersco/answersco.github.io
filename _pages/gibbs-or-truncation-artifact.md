title: "Gibbs or truncation artifact?"

Occurs at borders of abrupt change in signal intensity and appears as alternating bright and dark lines on the MRI images that are parallel to an adjacent border.
Origin: Fourier-based imaging technique leads to image errors near sharp boundaries.
Solution: Increasing the number of phase encodings and more samples acquired during frequency encoding (i.e., increase matrix), which decreases the spacing between artifactual lines. Other methods include pre- or post-reconstruction image filtration.

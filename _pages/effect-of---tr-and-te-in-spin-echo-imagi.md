title: "Effect of &#8593; TR and TE in spin-echo imaging?"
---
&#8593; TR&#8594; &#8595; the T1 weighting because it allows the longitudinal magnetization to recover more completely between excitations.
&#8593; TE &#8594; &#8593; the T2-weighting because it allows transverse magnetization to lose phase coherence for a longer period of time.
As TE &#8593; &#8594; differences in signal between short T1 tissues (e.g. fat) and long T2 tissues (e.g. CSF) become more apparent.

Placental chorioangioma: hamartoma of the placenta
Usually well circumscribed, hypoechoic masses near the cord insertion.
Flow within the mass pulsating at the fetal HR is diagnostic
Usually mean nothing, but if very large (&gt; 4 cm) and multiple (chorioangiomatosis), they can sequester platelets and cause high-output heart failure (hydrops)

Placental hematoma (with abruption): does NOT have pulsating Doppler flow.

Inflammatory breast cancer = swollen red breast with skin thickening = need dermal biopsy
most common MRI finding is a mass or multiple masses (73%). Masses are frequently multiple, small, and confluent; mass margins, irregular; and internal enhancement pattern, heterogeneous.
- Look for striking breast global asymmetry, DIFFUSE skin thickening, and trabecular thickening
- breast is not painful that doesn't respond to antibiotics

&quot; gets cooled down with chemo and radiation, prior to surgery&quot;

title: "What are techniques to decrease metallic streak artifact in CT of hips with prosthesis?"
---
-Increase reconstruction slice thickness- will show greater partial volume effect
-Use of metal artifact removal software- changes the pattern of the artifact.
-Use smooth reconstruction kernel- will not change partial volume effect.

Transportation of radioactive materials
- Controlled by the DOT
o Assigns hazard levels to radionuclides

Type A packaging - used for lower energy pharmaceuticals
Type B packaging - used for higher energy (F18 FDG and I-131); more accident resistant than type A packaging


Radioactive labels on packages
- White I - low energy (Tc); no special handling; surface dose less than 0.5 mrem/h
- Yellow II - F18 FDG; up to 50 mrem/h surface and up to 1 mrem/h at 3 ft
- Yellow III - not seen in our lab; surface up to 200 mrem/h; 10 mrem/h at 3 ft

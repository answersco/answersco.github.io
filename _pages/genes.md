-code for proteins but:
-only a small part of the human genome codes for proteins --
humans have ~20,000 protein-encoding genes
-some of the human genome controls protein synthesis - including timing, speed, and location
-1.5% code for proteins

-are segments of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
-contain the instructions for protein production: as long as you have the right sequence of proteins, you'll produce these correctly

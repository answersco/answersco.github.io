title: "Normal liver transplant US and impending thrombosis"
---
Normal transplant US:
Should have RAPID systolic upstroke
RI usually 0.5-0.7
Hepatic artery peak velocity &lt; 200 cm/sec
Acceleration time (diastole to systolic peak) &lt; 0.08 s

Hepatic artery is key supply to liver (unlike normal liver, which receives 70% of flow from portal vein) - hepatic artery thrombosis results in bile duct necrosis
Thrombosis occurs early (&lt;15 days) or late (years, usually associated with chronic rejection or sepsis)

Syndrome of impending thrombosis- 3-10 days postop
1st: initial normal waveform
2nd: no diastolic flow
3rd: dampening systolic flow
-Tardus parvus (usually secondary to stenosis rather than thrombosis).
-RI &lt; 0.5
4th: loss of hepatic waveform.

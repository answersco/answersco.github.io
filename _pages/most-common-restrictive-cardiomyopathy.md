Amyloidosis: seen in 50% of cases of systemic disease

Deposits in myocardium cause abnormal diastolic function with biatrial enlargement, concentric thickening of LV, and reduced systolic function (usually both ventricles)

Sometimes see late Gd enhancement over the entire subendocardial circumference.

Classic scenario: longer T1 needed (e.g. 350 ms rather than normal T1 ~200 ms) due to difficulty suppressing myocardium. Blood pool may end up darker than myocardium.

Early and late manifestations. Acute pneumonitis occurs within 1 to 3 months and appears as homogeneous or patchy ground glass opacities, luciences and volume loss. The changes evolve over the next 6 to 12 months and usually become stable within 2 years. They appear radiographically as dense consolidation, traction bronchiectasis and volume loss.

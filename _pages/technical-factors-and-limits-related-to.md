Rate of energy absorption increases with frequency. Eventually the rise in temperature slows secondary to conduction and perfusion with an eventual steady state.

Thermal-induced damage is a threshold phenomenon (no damage until a certain temp is reached).

Cavitation is most likely to occur with low frequency and high pressure.

Spectral doppler deposits more heat than gray-scale

Per NRCP, risk-benefit decision needed when TI exceeds a value of 1.0 and MI exceeds 0.5.

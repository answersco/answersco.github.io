title: "Thoracic duct embo basics and anatomy"
---
Thoracic duct: originates at cisterna chyli and is most often a single structure located anterior to the thoracic spine, usually on the right.
-Enters the left subclavian vein in the region of the sternoclavicular joint.

Percutaneous embo of thoracic duct has 80% success rate in controlling chylous effusions due to thoracic duct injury.
Access to thoracic duct is through transabdominal catheterization of the cisterna chyli.
The cisterna is punctured using local anesthetic and fluoro guidance after opacification with iodized oil during a lymphangiogram.
When access to the thoracic duct is gained, a microcatheter is advanced as close to leak as possible.
Embo performed with multiple coils and N-butyl cyanoacrylate (n-BCA) glue.

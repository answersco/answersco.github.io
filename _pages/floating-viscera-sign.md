title: "Floating viscera sign"
---
Classic angio sign of dissection
Shown as opacification of abdominal aortic branch vessels during aortography (with catheter in aortic true lumen)
The branch vessels (celiac, SMA, renals) arise out of nowhere: appear to be floating, with little or no antegrade opacification of the aortic true lumen

Mesenteric vessels look like theyre coming out of nowhere on angio, indication of dissection.

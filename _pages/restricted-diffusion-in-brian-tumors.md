title: "Restricted diffusion in brian tumors"
---
Brain tumors&#8594; the central portions of some primary and secondary brain tumors, if not yet necrotic, may exhibit restricted diffusion as they outgrow their blood supply and become ischemic.
Once the tumors are necrotic, they will not demonstrate restricted diffusion&#8594; thus ADC appears higher in the center.

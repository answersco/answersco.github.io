title: "What is pulsatile CSF flow?"
---
Pulsatile flow is the to-and-fro motion of CSF generated by the arterial pulsations.Normally, the force of the arterial pressure wave is buffered by the meningeal compliance (elasticity). Communicating hydrocephalus develops from decreased compliance, increased amplitude of the outward intraventricular pulsations, or loss of the normal anatomic relationship of inward/outward forces.

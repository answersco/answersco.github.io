title: "Pulse pile-up and dead-time for a gamma camera?"
---
If the event rate exceeds the ability of the detector to separate pulses then there pulse pile up which results in erroneously high energies and mis-positioning of events. As the rate of interactions increases so does the rate of missed events. The ratio of recorded events to actual events = dead time. Generally this is not an issue for gamma cameras, but is a big issue for PET.

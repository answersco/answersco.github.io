Weekly Tests &#8594; provide a visual check of the spatial resolution and the geometric linearity of the system
Using a low energy high resolution collimator, a bar phantom is placed between a flood source and the detector head.
Data are acquired&#8594; the resulting image is examined to check that the appropriate bars are resolvable, and that they appear straight and uniform.
Each week the phantom is rotated so that the resolution is fully tested everywhere on the detector head.

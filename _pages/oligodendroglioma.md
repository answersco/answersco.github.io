90% calcify by CT
Most specific finding: cortical infiltration and thickening
Expanded cortex, usually frontal lobe
1p/19q deletion associated with better outcome

calcified, heterogeneous
more diffuse compared to ganglioglioma. 
may erode/remodel calvarium

- Calcifies 90% of the time
- Cortically based
- EXPANDS the cortex
- Associated 1p/19q deleted (better prognosis)

-supratentorial
-cortical tumor --&gt; expands cortex
-hypodensity with CALCIFICATION
-1p/19q deletion

90% calcify, MC in frontal lobe, expands the cortex, 1p/19q deletion (sensitive to chemo / better outcome)

The one that calcifies almost always
Frontal lobe, expands cortex
1p/19q deletion has a better outcome

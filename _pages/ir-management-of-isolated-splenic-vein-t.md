title: "IR management of isolated splenic vein thrombosis."
---
Acute splenic vein occlusion: usually no IR treatment because spleen has well-established collateral drainage.

Chronic occlusion: short gastric veins become the major venous drainage of the spleen.
-Acute UGI bleeding can occur from the resulting gastric varices.
-Can mimic variceal hemorrhage in a cirrhotic patient. However SV thrombosis rarely results in esophageal varices unless cirrhosis is also present.
-Patients bleeding from isolated gastric varices must be evaluated for splenic vein occlusion before TIPS creation is contemplated, because TIPS does not provide benefit to these patients.

Creation of a TIPS with intent to recanalize splenic vein should be considered, especially in cirrhotic patients.
BRTO, splenectomy, and splenic artery embo are other potential treatment options.

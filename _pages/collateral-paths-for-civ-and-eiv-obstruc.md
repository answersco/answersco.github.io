title: "Collateral paths for CIV and EIV obstruction"
---
Occlusion of one CIV: results in retrograde flow in the ipsilateral IIV with cross-pelvic collateralization to the contralateral IIV.

Occlusion of both common and external iliac veins: results in drainage through the pubic, inferior epigastric, and lumbar veins.
-Additional collateral drainage by lumbar, paraspinal, and other retroperitoneal veins can occur.

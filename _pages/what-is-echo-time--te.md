title: "What is echo time (TE)?"
---
Echo time (TE) &#8594; operator-selected interval between transmission of a 90&#176; pulse followed by a 180&#176; pulse and the measurement of the MRI signal in a common spin echo pulse sequence.
Longer TE values&#8594; result in &#8593; T2 contrast determined by the different T2 relaxation times of the tissues
In the spin echo pulse sequence&#8594; a long TR and long TE result in T2 image contrast.
Example: in the brain, with a long TE, CSF has the greatest MXY vector&#8594; thus appears brightest (CSF protons don't lose their synchronous precession as quickly as protons of white or gray matter).

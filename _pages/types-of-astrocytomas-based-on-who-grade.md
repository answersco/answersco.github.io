title: "Types of Astrocytomas based on WHO Grade?"
---
- Pilocytic Astrocytoma (WHO 1)
- Diffuse Astrocytoma (WHO 2)
- Anaplastic Astrocytoma (WHO 3)
- GBM (WHO 4)

- low grade tumors don't typically enhance (except pilocytic astrocytoma which has an enhancing nodule)

- GBM is a beast; necrosis, grows rapidly, crosses midline

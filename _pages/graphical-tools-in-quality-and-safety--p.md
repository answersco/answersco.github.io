title: "Graphical tools in quality and safety: Pareto chart"
---
Pareto principle: when multiple variables affect a situation, a few of them are actually responsible for most of the impact.

Pareto chart: used to visually display a rank ordering of quality, safety, or risk-factor issues by importance or impact.
Used to determine the most important quality issues, in which factors that contribute to the overall effect are arranged from left to right in decreasing order of importance or frequency.
Contains both bars and a line graph: bars depict individual values or variables; lines illustrate the cumulative total.
Proper ordering guides the team to concentrate its efforts on factors with the greatest impact.

-Skin testing for TB

-Intradermal injection of PPD (purified protein derivative)

-Relies on antibody response: read 48-72 hours after injection bc that's how long it takes for body to recognize 

- If positive = induration (reddened, raised, hardening area) at site
 
&gt; 10 mm = high risk: if recent immigrant from high risk area, IV drug user, resident or employee of high risk area, children &lt; 4 yr or if high risk exposure
 
&gt; 5 mm if compromised immune system, (HIV or AIDs), or in close contact with someone with Tb, chest X-ray changes consistent with TB

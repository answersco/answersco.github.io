title: "One disorder or several"
---
Not as simple as one gene, one protein, one disease:
1) different mutations in the same gene can cause different degrees of symptoms - ex: CFTR; ion channels mutations causes different phenotypes 
2) different mutations in the same gene can cause different disorders - ex: beta globin
3) some mutations can cause different diseases when the gene is expressed in different tissues - ex: Laminin A are mutations that affect interactions w/ chromatin
4) different mutations can cause a rapid aging disorder, a form of muscular dystrophy, a heart disorder, others

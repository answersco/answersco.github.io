title: "Ebstein anomaly"
---
Malformed, enlarged tricuspid valve that is displaced downward. Atrialization of RV. Severe TR. Atrial right-to-left shunting results in cyanosis in the more severely affected patients.

Ebstein anomaly&#8594; cyanotic CHD with &#8595; pulmonary vascularity and cardiomegaly
Malformation of TV characterized by apical displacement of the septal and posteroinferior leaflets &#8594; results in obstruction of the pulmonic valve and RV outflow tract &#8594; lead to &quot;atrialization&quot; of RV.
ASD is always present.
Imaging typically shows huge heart, with massive RA enlargement and &#8595; pulmonary vascularity &#8594; box-shaped heart.
Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum would appear identical.

- hypoplastic Tricuspid Valve with apical (downward) displacement of posterior leaf
-Enlarged RA, small RV (atrialized), and tricuspid regurgitation
- &quot;Box-shaped&quot; heart.

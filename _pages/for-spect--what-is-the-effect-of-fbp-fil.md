title: "For SPECT, what is the effect of FBP filter cut-off frequency image mottle and spatial resolution?"
---
Higher cut-off frequencies- result in the retention of higher spatial frequencies, making images appear more mottled or grainy, but potentially with better spatial resolution. 

Lower cut-off frequencies render the image smoother.

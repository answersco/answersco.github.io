title: "What does time of flight in PET refer to?"
---
Time of flight PET uses the difference in arrival times of an annihilation photon pair to get a probability function of where along the line of the response the annihilation could have occurred. This increased precision in event localization allows for reconstruction of images with improved signal to noise.

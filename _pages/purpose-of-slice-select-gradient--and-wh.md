title: "Purpose of slice-select gradient, and what happens if it doesn't turn on?"
---
Slice-select gradient&#8594; responsible for specifying excited slices (i.e. slice orientation).
If the direction is changed, the direction of the stack of slices will change as well.
If the slice-select gradient doesn't turn on, basically you will not excite a slice but a huge portion of the patient, because the magnetic field in the scanner is not perfectly uniform.

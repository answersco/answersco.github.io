Restricted diffusion: bright from ~30 minutes to 2 weeks
Restricted diffusion without increased FLAIR signal suggests hyperacute (&lt; 6 hours) infarct

Other causes of restricted diffusion: CJD (cortical), herpes, epidermoids, hypercellular tumors (classically lymphoma), acute MS lesions, oxyhemoglobin, post-ictal state, artifacts (susceptibility and T2-shine-through).

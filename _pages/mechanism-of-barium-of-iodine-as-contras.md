title: "Mechanism of barium of iodine as contrast agents:"
---
Barium and iodine used as contrast agents because they readily absorb x-ray photons in 35-50 keV range
X-ray tube operated using 65-90 kVp produces many x-rays in 35-50 keV range&#8594; iodine or barium strongly absorb this radiation&#8594; high image contrast.

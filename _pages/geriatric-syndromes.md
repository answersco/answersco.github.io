8) altered presentation of illness
-non-symptoms: something going on but no symptoms and we do not find out until they get sicker and sicker
-vague presentation: not really complaining but will not eat or drink and are more fatigued than usually
-altered: thinks the issue is one thing such as incontinence but then grow to find out they have an infection and that is the reason for incontinence

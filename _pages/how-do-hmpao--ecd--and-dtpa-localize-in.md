title: "How do HMPAO, ECD, and DTPA localize in the brain?"

All 3 attached to Tc99m (DTPA also to In-111 for CSF studies)!

HMPAO &amp; ECD are lipophilic and can cross BBB to do parenchymal brain imaging (SPECT)

DTPA = &quot;Don't Think Parenchymal&quot; = cannot cross BBB, so it stays in the blood or CSF (ideal for shunt studies &amp; brain death) = effectively an &quot;angiographic tracer&quot;
- also good because it can be repeated without delay but you CANNOT DO SPECT

title: "1) Average radiation dose is 100-200 mrads per view 200-400 mrads for standard 2 views (each breast) 2) Maximum allowable dose by ACR accreditation guidelines: 300 mrad per view or 600mrad per breast. 3) Peak voltage: 25-30 kvp 4) ACR recommendations for screening mammography: 1) yearly for asymptomatic women &gt; 40 years 2) benefit for women &lt; 40 if high risk (usually 10 yrs before relative onset) 5) Magnification views: 1) obtained by increasing distance btw breast &amp; receptor using magnification stand 2) less noise, so better resolution 3) requires smaller focal spot to minimize geometric blur 4) air gap: therefore no grid 5) increased chance of motion b/c of long exposure time. 6) Positive biopsy rate for screeners: 30% 7) Terminal duct lobular unit: functional unit of breast, change with hormonal changes"

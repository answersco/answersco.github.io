Fast Spoiled GRE&#8594; allows fast 3D imaging with high resolution
After the RF excitation pulse, the frequency encode gradient dephases and then rephases the transverse magnetization several times &#8594; produces a train of gradient echoes &#8594; Each echo fills 1 row of k-space.
Preparatory inversion pulse&#8594; used to produce T1 weighting.
Acquisition time &#8595; by the echo train length.

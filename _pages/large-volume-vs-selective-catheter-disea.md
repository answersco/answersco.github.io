title: "Large-volume vs selective catheter disease"
---
Catheters for aortography: thick walled to handle large-volume, high-pressure injections
-Often curled at tip (pigtail): keeps tip of catheter away from vessel wall
-Multiple side-holes proximal to the curl such that most contrast exits catheter in a diffuse cloud

Selective catheters: thinner walled for lower volume injections, shaped to seek branches off the main vessel, and tapered at the tip to advance smoothly into branch vessel
-Single end-hole to direct contrast into specific direction
-Commonly have fine metal or plastic strands incorporated into the wall (&quot;braid&quot;) so that the tip is responsive to gentle rotation of the hub.

Fistulas: variable location of problems, but most commonly venous outflow stenosis (typically juxta-anastomotic or runoff vein)

Stenosis: 75% recur within 6 months of treatment

Thrill: should be a continuous thrill at the anastomosis
-If only present in systole, the patient has a stenosis
-If you can localize a thrill somewhere else in the venous outflow, that is probably a stenosis

Pulsatile fistula: indicates a more central stenosis
Bruit: normal finding in outflow vein

Steal syndrome: &quot;cold painful fingers&quot; during HD, relieved by manual compression of the AVF.
Usually has a stenosis in native artery distal to the fistula

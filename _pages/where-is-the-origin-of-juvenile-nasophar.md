JNA arises from within the nasal aspect of the sphenopalatine foramen, which is the medial boundary of the pterygopalatine fossa.
JNA is centered in the nasopharynx, and enhances avidly.
As it grows, it commonly extends into the pterygopalatine fossa and/or orbits.
Common expansion of pterygopalatine fossa and anterior bowing or displacement of the posterior wall of the maxillary sinus.

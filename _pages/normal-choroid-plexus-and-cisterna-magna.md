title: "Normal choroid plexus and cisterna magna on US"
---
Choroid plexus is large and echogenic. 
There should be &lt; 3 mm separation of the choroid plexus from the medial wall of the lateral ventricle (&gt; 3 = ventriculomegaly, which shows ventricular atrium diameter &gt; 10 mm- most common secondary to aqueductal stenosis)

Normal cisterna magna is between 2 and 11 mm
Too small: think Chiari II
Too large: think Dandy Walker

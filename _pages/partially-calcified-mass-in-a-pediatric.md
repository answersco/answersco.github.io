title: "Partially calcified mass in a pediatric patient with Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome"
---
Cardiac fibroma: benign cardiac tumor that primarily occurs in children (~85%)
Imaging: appears as a homogeneous mass (mean diameter of 5 cm) located in the interventricular septum or LV free wall.
The mass will not contract like the rest of the heart.
Nearly 50% demonstrate calcification, but there is almost never cystic change or necrosis.

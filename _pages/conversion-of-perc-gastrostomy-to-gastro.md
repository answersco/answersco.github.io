title: "Conversion of perc gastrostomy to gastrojejunostomy: pre-procedural considerations"
---
Often done for patients with g-tube who aspirate or can't tolerate gastric feeding.

Pre-procedure consideration:
-If existing tube placed by surgically, endoscopically, or radiologically.
-Length of time between initial tube placement and requested conversion. For some radiologic and endoscopic tubes, a mature track may not have had time to form between stomach and abdominal wall, increasing risk of disrupting tract or losing access during attempted conversion.
-Size of existing tube. Surgically or endoscopically placed tubes may be larger than radiologically placed tubes. The catheter to be placed must be of a size that will take up most of the percutaneous tract to prevent leakage of gastric contents.

-Initial tube hopefully included T-fastener gastropexy and angulation of the perc tract toward the pylorus to facilitate easier conversion.
-By using T-fasteners, even if the tract is immature, conversion can still be performed because access to stomach isn't lost.

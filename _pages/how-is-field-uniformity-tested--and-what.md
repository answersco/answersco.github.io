title: "How is field uniformity tested, and what are the acceptable values?"
---
2-5% non-uniformity allowed (1% if SPECT)
Tested via a flood: checks if camera can produce a uniform image along the entire crystal surface
Can use either Na-Tc-99m-O4 or Co-57

Extrinsic (with collimator): done daily, testing both collimator and crystals
Intrinsic (no collimator): weekly
Recommended counts for both range between 5 and 10 million

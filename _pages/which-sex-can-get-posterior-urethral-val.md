title: "Which sex can get posterior urethral valves? Imaging appearance on US?"

Only MALES! (it's a membrane from Wolffian duct origin)

- causes outflow obstruction with abrupt caliber change on VCUG (from normal anterior urethra to the abnormally dilated posetrior urethra)

* Prenatal US: combination of bilateral hydronephrosis and a large bladder in a male fetus is virtually pathognomonic of posterior urethral valves

* Keyhole sign

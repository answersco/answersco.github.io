title: "Accuracy:"

Accuracy: assessed by comparing a measurement to a reference standard (Gold standard)
Defined as the degree to which a variable represents what it is intended to represent (as opposed to precision, which is defined as the degree to which a measurement has the same value when measured several times)
Strategies for enhancing accuracy: standardizing measurement methods, training observers, refining/automating instruments, and blinding.
Accuracy is the sum of TP and TN divided by the total # of subjects studies
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
Depends on disease prevalence &#8594; accuracy is less useful for conditions with extremely low disease presence.

How close a measured value is to the true value

A description of how close a measurement is to the true value of the quantity measured.

This is how often the test was RIGHT in both directions (right when it says you have disease and right when it says you DONT have disease)
 TN + TP / TN + FN + TP + FP

title: "Incidence Rate"
---
-measures all new cases of a disease or health condition appearing during a given time
-is affected only by factors related to the risk of developing disease

EX. the number of new emerging cases of measles in a school over a period of time (200 new cases of measles/1,000 students at risk)
-In the case of a measles outbreak, the number of children having measles would be removed from the total number of children at risk in the school population (denominator).
-Three weeks after the start of the measles epidemic, this will describe the number of cases of measles that appear during that period in terms of the number of persons at risk (numerator).

What is the incidence rate in black males and black females per 10,000 people in the 1-year period?
Black males:
150 x 10,000 = 50.7 per 10,000 in 1-year
29,560
Black females:
234 x 10,000 = 82.6 per 10,000 in 1-year
28,315

***&#8226;For the black males, you would divide the # of black males with the new infection because incidence measures the new cases and divide it by the total male population and multiply it by 10,000.
&#8226;You would do the same for the black female population.

title: "Dominance; Branches of RCA, LAD, and LCX."
---
Dominance: determined by the side that supplies the posterior descending artery (PDA), posterolateral artery (PLA), and AV nodal branch (AVN). 7% codominant anatomy, typically with RCA supplying PDA, and LCX supplying PLA.

RCA: arises from R coronary cusp and gives off SA nodal branch (posteriorly), conus branch (anteriorly, supplying RV outflow tract), acute marginal and muscular branches (courses along anterior RV wall), AV nodal branch, PDA (in normal R-dominant system to supply the posterior half of septum).
Terminal branch is most commonly the posterolateral branch (PLA) that supplies the posterior LV.

Left main: LAD, LCX, (+/-ramus in between).
Courses between PA and LAA.

LAD: Courses in the anterior interventricular groove.
Gives off diagonal branches (LAD-Diagonal) and septal branches, which penetrate septum to supply anterior half of septum.

LCX: courses underneath the LAA in the left atrioventricular groove.
Gives off the obtuse marginal branch (OM; circOMflex), which supplies the posterolateral wall of the LV.
Uncommonly (~7%) supplies the PDA = left-dominant

title: "Twinkle artifact?"

Twinkle artifact -rapid fluctuation of a mixture of red and blue colors without actual movement on color doppler. It occurs behind strongly reflecting surfaces such as calcifications. Clinical application - diagnosis of renal stones

Occurs behind strongly reflecting surfaces such as calcification, manifesting as a noisy spectrum with rapidly fluctuating red and blue colors

Has higher sensitivity than shadowing for detection of small stones

Highly depending on machine settings and how round the reflecting surface is (more rough = more twinkle).

Happens behind HIGHLY reflective surfaces like calcifications
Manifests as a noisy spectrumn with rapid fluctuation of red and blue colors

This is HIGHLY more sensitive for calcium containing stones that is shadowing artifact
You can increase twinkle if you put your focal zone BELOW the reflective surface
The ROUGHER the reflector, the MORE twinkle

Looks like theres movement/flow when there isnt. bc rough surface causes split into complex wave pattern. Also could be related to &quot;phase jitter&quot;

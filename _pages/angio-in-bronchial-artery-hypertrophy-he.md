title: "Angio in bronchial artery hypertrophy/hemoptysis- vessel selection"
---
Selective injection of subclavian, thyrocervical trunk, internal mammary, anterior chest wall arteries (e.g. long thoracic), intercostals, and phrenic arteries may be necessary in patients with extensive pathology, prior embo, or surgery.
Bronchial, intercostal, and thyrocervical angiograms must be carefully inspected for branches to anterior spinal artery.

When arterial source can't be identified, pulmonary angiography should be considered in patients with cavitary lung lesions of history of recent Swan-Ganz catheterization.

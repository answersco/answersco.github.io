title: "Many people have difficulty falling asleep and waking up in the morning."
---
Many people find it hard to wake up in the morning. We groan and reach for the snooze button when the alarm goes off. Busy days and late nights make it hard to get enough sleep. Even when we do get to bed on time, unfinished business from the day or worries about tomorrow's events can keep us from falling asleep. Our ancestors would laugh at the thought of being unable to fall asleep. After toiling in the fields or factories from early morning until evening, they had no problem falling asleep. But they, too, probably groaned at the sound of the rooster crowing early in the morning.

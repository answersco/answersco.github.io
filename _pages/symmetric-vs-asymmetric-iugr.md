Asymmetric: restriction of weight followed by length &#8594; more common
Head is normal in size, and body is small&#8594; &quot;head sparing&quot;
Mainly seen in 3rd trimester&#8594; classically normal growth for first 2 trimesters, with normal head and small body in 3rd trimester, with mom having chronic HTN or pre-eclampsia.
Major causes: high BP, severe malnutrition, Ehlers-Danlos.

Symmetric: global growth restriction &#8594; does NOT spare the head

title: "Advantages of MWA over RFA"
---
Compared to RFA, MWA causes a much larger zone of active heating (up to 2 cm surrounding the microwave applicator compared to a few mm in RFA) because of a much broader field of power density
-The larger heating zone may give a more uniform temperature in the ablation zone, leading to a larger field of cell death.

Because of the decreased dependence on thermal conduction, MWA is less susceptible to heat-sink effect compared to RFA.

Because microwaves are electromagnetic, MWA is not limited by the increased impedance seen with tissue boiling and charring in RFA.
-Allows for much higher intratumoral temperatures, which translates into considerably larger ablation zones with relatively shorter treatment durations.

Current MWA prototypes allow placement of multiple applicators simultaneously to treat larger tumors.

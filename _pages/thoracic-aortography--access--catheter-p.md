title: "Thoracic aortography: access, catheter position, views"
---
Access: usually femoral, though axillary artery can also be used
-Right axillary preferred for dissection or injections limited to ascending aorta and arch
-Left axillary preferred for catheter placement in descending aorta only.

1st view should be LAO with catheter ~2 cm above the aortic valve- this opens the arch and places great-vessel origins in profile.
-The FOV should extend from the proximal great vessels to the diaphragm for initial injections.

RAO: for ascending aorta, trauma, aneurysm, dissection
LAO: for ascending Ao, arch and great vessel origins, trauma, aneurysm, dissection
AP, lateral: for distal arch, trauma, dissection/aneurysm, localization of bronchial arteries

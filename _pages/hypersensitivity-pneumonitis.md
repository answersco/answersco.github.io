inhalational exposure
Acute/subacute - centrilobular ggo nodules, bronchiolitis
Chronic - fibrosis with bronchiectasis &amp; ggo

Inhaled antigenic organic dusts: Farmer's lung (moldy hay). Humidifier lung (thermophilic bacteria). Bird-fancier's lung (avian proteins). Acute and chronic forms. Chronic disease findings: Interlobular and intralobular interstitial thickening. Honeycombing, Traction bronchiectasis. May spare costophrenic angles.

Tons of shit can cause this, it's common and related to allergen exposure, seen more frequently in smokers
- Can be acute, subacute, or chronic
-Imaging normally done in the subacute phase where you will see centrilobular GGO with air trapping and mosaic perfusion (this is because this entity is a type of small airway disease) &#8212; SEE IMAGE for GGO in centrilobular distribution 
- Imaging in the chronic phase will show UIP AND Air trapping

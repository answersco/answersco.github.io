title: "Gradenigo's syndrome"
---
petrous apicitis, is a complication of otitis media and mastoiditis involving the apex of the petrous temporal bone. It is defined by involvement of the abducens nerve (sixth cranial nerve) causing lateral gaze palsy.

The proximity of the venous sinuses to the petrous apex is the reason for the historically high incidence of venous sinus thrombosis associated with petrous apicitis. The inflammation may extend into the Dorello canal, which transmits CN VI and the gasserian ganglion (CN V). Inflammation of the canal produces the triad of symptoms recognized by Gradenigo: lateral rectus (CN VI) palsy, retroorbital pain, and otorrhea.

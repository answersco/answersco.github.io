title: "Egalitarian society"
---
This kind of society is organized so that all of its members have equal or similar rights and powers. An egalitarian society may contain little social stratification. By looking at modern-day hunter-forager societies, anthropologists infer that hunter-foragers during the Paleolithic era (before about 8000 B.C.E.) were relatively egalitarian.

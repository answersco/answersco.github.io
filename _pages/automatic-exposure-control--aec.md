title: "Automatic Exposure Control (AEC)"
---
This is essentially an ionization chamber that acts as a timer to determine appropriate exposure based on body part
This ionization chamber is placed between the patient an the image receptor
AEC only controls the quantity of radiation, i.e., this is a mAs thing
Exposure is determined by the density and thickness of the area of the patient placed over the ionization chamber

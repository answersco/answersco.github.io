title: "Angio in atheroembolism: indication and findings"

Angio: obtained when noninvasive studies are inconclusive or when a pulse deficit is present
For unilateral embolization, the catheter should be inserted from the contralateral CFA.
-Irregular or severe stenosis, ulcerated plaque, or aneurysm may be found.
-Intraluminal filling defects are not seen with microembolism. Thus, normal angio doesn't rule out atheroembolism.

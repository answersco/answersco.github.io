title: "What is the principal behind Phase Contrast imaging?"
---
A bipolar gradient is applied between the excitation pulse and read-out (negative gradient followed by equally opposite positive) - obtain an image
- Then you obtain a subsequent image where those gradients are reversed (positive gradient then negative).

* Anything stationary will subtract out, but anything that moved (e.g. flowing blood) will acquire a different phase that can be QUANTIFIED!
- better background suppression than TOF and decreased sensitivity to intravoxel dephasing)

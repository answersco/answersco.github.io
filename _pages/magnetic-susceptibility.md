title: "Magnetic susceptibility"
---
Paramagnetic - increases field
Diamagnetic - decreases field
Ferromagnetic - strongly increases field
Worse with GRE, in phase (later time -&gt; more T2*), tissue interfaces, EPI
Fixed by:
- SE
- wider receiver bandwidth
- align longitudinal axis of metal with main field
- STIR for fat suppression (over selective sat)

title: "Collateral supply of kidneys"
---
Renal arteries are end arteries
Unlike colonic or hepatic vasculature, the intrarenal collateral pathways are poorly developed

In presence of slowly progressive proximal renal artery stenosis, renal capsular, ureteral, adrenal, and other retroperitoneal arteries may enlarge sufficiently to provide enough blood supply to keep the kidney alive, but not functioning normally.

Acute proximal occlusion of previously normal renal artery results in profound ischemia due to inadequate pre-existing collateral supply.

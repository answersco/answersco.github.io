title: "What MRI sequence can be used to distinguish extradural spinal lesions?"
---
Answer: T2
T2 of sequestered disk is low signal.
Meningioma, schwannoma, and mets are often very T2 bright.
The peripheral rim of low SI is specific for sequestered disk material.

Enhancement can also be used, as the disk may show peripheral enhancement, but the other entities should show some internal enhancement.

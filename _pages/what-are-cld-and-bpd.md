title: "What are CLD and BPD?"
---
CLD is chronic lung disease and the final pathway of all injury to the lung, to some degree. It is a result of immaturity as well as oxygen toxicity and barotrauma in infants who received prolonged ventilatory support. BPD is bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

SDD/RDS is the most common underlying disease of CLD. The risk of CLD increases when SDD is complicated with PIE.

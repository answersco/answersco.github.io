title: "Diagnosis and IR tx of pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS)"
---
PCS: pain, dyspareunia, menstrual abnormalities, vulvar varies, and LE varicose veins
Dx: symptoms + gonadal vein diameter of 10 mm (5 mm is normal)

Tx (if GnRH agonists are used and fail): sclerosis of the parauterine venous plexus + embolization of the ovarian and internal iliac veins.
Often staged- ovarian veins embolized first, followed (if unsuccessful) by iliac veins.
Best results occur when the entire length of both gonadal veins are embolized.

Complications include thrombosis of the parent vein (iliac or renal) and thrombus migration (PE)

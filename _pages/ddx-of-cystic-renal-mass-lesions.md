Neoplastic:
Cystic RCC
Multilocular cystic nephroma: benign cystic neoplasm with bimodal distribution affecting baby boys and middle-aged women
Characteristic (but nonspecific) feature: propensity to herniate into the renal pelvis, causing hydronephrosis
In children, it can be indistinguishable from cystic Wilms tumor
Mixed epithelial and stromal tumor (MEST): benign neoplasm composed of epithelial and mesenchymal elements, typically in middle-aged women
May be solid or cystic

Non-neoplastic:
Renal abscess
Hemorrhagic renal cyst: no enhancing components

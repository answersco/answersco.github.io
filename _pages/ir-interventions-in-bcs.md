-If a focal IVC or major HV stenosis is identified, angioplasty or stents should be performed.
-Pressure gradients should be measured across HVs and IVC (normal &lt;/= 2 mm Hg) to determine if intervention is necessary.
-Acute thrombotic occlusions of main HVs and IVC can be treated with mechanical thrombectomy or catheter-directed thrombolysis.

TIPS: indicated when there is diffuse venous obliteration and uncontrollable ascites or progressive cirrhosis despite anticoagulation.

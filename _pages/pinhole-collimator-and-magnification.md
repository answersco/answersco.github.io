Pinhole collimator: magnifies and inverts the image
-Usually cone-shaped
-Used for thyroids and other small parts

Magnification occurs at a ratio of: 
-pinhole to detector &quot;f&quot; / pinhole to patient &quot;b&quot;
-If F = B there is no magnification
-If F &gt; B there is magnification
-If F &lt; B the object gets smaller

Magnification at the front is greater than at the back- large objects get distorted.

Pinhole cameras have poor sensitivity
Want collimator and detector as close as possible to the patient for best spatial resolution (affected by distance).
Sensitivity is not affected by distance.

Tc-labeled RBCs
Delayed blood pool typically done (30 minutes - 3 hours)
If small (&lt; 2 cm) need SPECT to localize. Otherwise planar imaging will show a hot focus.
Want to see marked HOT on delays, with no real hot spot on immediate flow or immediate pool.
Angiosarcoma could be hot on delays, but would also be hot on flow. 
Partially fibrosed hemangioma may be a false negative.

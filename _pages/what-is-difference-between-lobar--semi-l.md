Brain cleaves BACK TO FRONT (opposite of formation of corpus callosum front to back)

Lobar = Right and left hemispheres are separate, but anterior/inferoir frontal can be fused

Semi-lobar= FUSED Thalami, single frontal lobe

Alobar - Single large ventricle, fusion of thalami and basal ganglia, NO FALX, NO CORPUS

title: "- what is the idea behind seizure focus imaging in brain SPECT? - when do you need to inject the radiotracer?"
---
Ictal (during the seizure): seizure focus will be hot

Interictal (between seizures): seizure focus will be cold

- need to inject tracer (HMPAO or ECD) within 30 seconds of the seizure to get a good study

title: "Definition and causes of thoracic aortic aneurysms:"
---
Defined as ascending aortic diameter &gt; 4 cm, or descending aortic diameter &gt; 3 cm.
Size may also be normalized to body surface area and compared to reference values.
Double-oblique short-axis MPR images perpendicular to the aortic lumen (i.e. true short-axis) should always be used to measure aortic diameter.
Surgical treatment: recommended for ascending TAA &gt; 5.5 cm and descending TAA &gt; 6 cm.
Lower threshold of 4.5 cm for patients with connective tissue disorders and BAV aortopathy.
Annual growth rate &gt; 1 cm/year (or &gt; 5 mm/6 months) is an indication for surgical repair.

Causes: most due to atherosclerosis, most commonly descending
Connective tissue disorders (Marfans, Ehlers-Danlos)
Bicuspid aortic valve associated aortopathy
Vasculitis (including Takayasu, giant cell, ankylosing spondylitis, and relapsing polychondritis)
Cystic medial necrosis
Infectious aortitis

Annuloaortic ectasia: represents dilated sinuses of Valsalva and ascending aorta with effacement of the sinotubular junction&#8594; results in tulip-bulb-shaped aorta. Associated with Marfans and Ehlers-Danlos.

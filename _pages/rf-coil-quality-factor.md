title: "RF coil quality factor"
---
As the sensitive volume of the coil &#8595;, the total noise detected by the coil from structures adjacent to the selected slice plane also &#8595;
&#8594; Thus, a smaller coil volume will yield a better SNR

Noise sensitivity&#8594; is related to the RF coil sensitive volume, and is relatively independent of the reconstructed voxel size, while the signal is dependent on the voxel size.

A local coil (or better, a surface coil) &#8594; has a higher SNR than a body coil due to the smaller volume of the surface coil (making it sensitive to a smaller region of the object).
Also, coil proximity to the tissue improves the signal strength.

title: "Cytotoxic vs vasogenic edema: - intra or extracellular swelling?  - what is the malfunction? - imaging findings - pathology associated"
---
Cytotoxic edema:
- intracellular swelling
- malfunction of Na/K pump
- loss of gray-white matter differentiation
- seen with stroke

Vasogenic Edema:
- extracellular swelling
- disruption of blood brain barier
- edema tracking through the white matter
- seen with tumor and infection
- responds to steroids

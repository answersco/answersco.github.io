title: "What are typical mammo mA for the 0.1 mm and 0.3 mm focal spots? How long is the exposure?"
---
25-50 mA for 0.1 mm (3000 ms exposure) - Mag view
100 mA for 0.3 mm (1000 ms exposure)

(lower than normal mA or you'd melt the anode 2/2 small focal spot) - requires Longer exposure time of 1000 ms

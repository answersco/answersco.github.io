title: "Aortopulmonary window:"
---
Aortopulmonary (AP) window: mediastinal space nestled underneath the aortic arch (superior, anterior, and posterior boundaries) and the top of the pulmonary artery, bounded medially by the esophagus, trachea, and LMSB
Normal frontal XR: AP window is a shallow concave contour below the aortic knob and above the PA.
Abnormal convexity (outward bulging): suggests mass arising from or involving structures that normally live in the AP window:
Lymph nodes: LAD is most common cause
Left phrenic nerve: injury may cause paralysis of left hemidiaphragm
Recurrent laryngeal nerve: should be closely evaluated in new-onset hoarseness, especially with associated diaphragmatic paralysis
Left vagus nerve
Ligamentum arteriosum
Left bronchial arteries
Thoracic aortic aneurysm

---
Pure beta emitter- spares most of adjacent normal liver parenchyma (max penetration ~ 10 mm)
Pre-tx Tc-99m-MAA hepatic arterial injection for lung shunt fraction: ideally &lt; 10%
-Can use Y-90 for 10-20% but decrease dose
-High risk of XRT pneumonitis &gt; 20% shunt

175 and 185 keV emissions can be used to image
Average T1/2 = 2.67 days

beta emitter with T1/2 of 64 hours and soft tissue penetration of 2.5 cm.

title: "How does Gradient-Echo create signal, and what determines image-weighting?"
---
Gradient echo techniques use a single RF pulse and no 180&#176; rephasing pulse
&#8594; thus relaxation due to fixed field inhomogeneities is not reversed
&#8594; and the loss of signal results from T2* effects (pure T2 + static field inhomogeneities).
&#8594; the signal obtained is thus T2*-weighted rather than T2-weighted due to this magnetic susceptibility sensitivity.
Utilizes low flip angles (i.e. &lt;90 degrees)
For a gradient-echo sequence, image weighting will depend on:
The flip angle for T1 weighting&#8594; the greater the angle, the more T1-weighting
The flip angle is usually much smaller than the routine 90&#176; flip angle used in spin-echo imaging.
The TE for T2<b> weighting&#8594; the shorter the TE, the less T2</b>2*-weighting.

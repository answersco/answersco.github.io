IIIC: venous and lymph node involvement
Stage IV:
IVA: tumor growth through Gerota's fascia
IVB: distant metastatic disease

Limited to the kidney
1- &lt;7cm
2- &gt; 7cm

Still inside Gerota's fascia
3-A: renal vein invaded

C: IVC above the diaphragm

Beyond Gerota's fascia
4- also ipsilateral adrenal gland

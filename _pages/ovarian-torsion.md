title: "Ovarian torsion"
---
-enlarged ovary, peripheral follicles
-free fluid
-ovarian mass
-lack of arterial or venous flow

Ovary greater than 4 cm, unusual position, Peripheral follicles, free fluid, intermittent or normal flow.

Twisting of the ovary that is frequently related to a mass or cyst
- Most consistent finding = enlarged ovary + pain 
- This is NOT like the testical in that the ovary has a dual blood supply; therefore, you can HAVE flow and still be torsed
- If you DO NOT have flow, then this is obviously very suggestive 

Other clues:
- Peripherally located follicles 
- Free fluid
- Mass on the ovary

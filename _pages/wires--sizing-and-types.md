title: "Wires: sizing and types"
---
Sizing: wires are sized in inches
Standard wire: measures 0.035&quot; in diameter
Microwire: measures 0.018&quot; in diameter.
Standard floppy-tip wires: 
Floppy tip or J-tip allows the wire to be safely inserted blindly
Bentson: typically floppy-tip wire
Rosen: J-tip wire.
Hydrophilic wires: used to cross a stenosis, or for initial cannulation of an indwelling device, as would be performed for routine check and change.
Roadrunner and Glidewire are hydrophilic
Stiff wires: used when structural rigidity is required (e.g. devices that dilate subcutaneous tissues such as sheath or biliary drain need to be inserted over a stiff wire).
Amplatz is commonly used superstiff wire.

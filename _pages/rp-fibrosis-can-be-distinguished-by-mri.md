title: "RP fibrosis can be distinguished by MRI?"
---
Think of MRI = T2 and enhancement helps assess chronicity (enhancement in acute)

Medial deviation of ureters; more common in men; think of IgG4 disease

Causes: Ormond speculation: Retroperitoneal fibrosis is similar to collagen vascular disease, supported by coexistence with other inflammatory processes

Drugs: Methysergide, &#946;-blockers, hydralazine, ergotamine, LSD

Diseases that stimulate desmoplastic reaction
Malignant tumors, metastases, Hodgkin lymphoma, carcinoid tumor, hematoma, radiation, retroperitoneal injury, surgery, infection, urinary extravasation

LYMPHOMA is the one that lifts the aorta off the spine (not RP fibrosis)

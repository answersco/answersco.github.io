title: "Measurement of ABI, and abnormal measurements"
---
Take higher of DP or PT systolic BP at ankle and divide by the higher of either the L or R arm systolic pressure

Useful for identifying the presence or absence of arterial disease proximal to the ankle
Normal is 1.0 or higher
Claudication: seen at 0.5-0.9
Rest pain: seen ~0.3

Arterial calcifications (DM): limit compression and lead to falsely elevated ABI

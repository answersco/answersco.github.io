title: "Radiochemical purity of Tc99"
---
Tc comes out of the generator as Na-Tc99m-O4, which needs to be reduced before use by adding stannous ions (SnCl2).
Checking for free pertechnetate

Tested with thin-layer chromatography
Limits for free Tc:
-95% for Na99mTcO4
-92% for 99mTc sulfur colloid (MAA)
-91% for all other Tc radiopharmaceuticals.

Free Tc (pertechnetate) can occur from lack of stannous ions (reducing agent) or accidental air injection into the vial or syringe (which oxidizes)
Shown on Tc scan with gastric, salivary gland, and thyroid uptake.

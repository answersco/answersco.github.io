title: "Hood"
---
intoxication case in which defendant committed assault w/ deadly weapon against a police officer; this crime requires purpose, but the Court says it's really more of a general-intent crime than a specific-intent crime; evidence of intoxication here does NOT negate the intent required for simple assault or assault w/ a deadly weapon

title: "Intramural hematoma (IMH): diagnosis and treatment"
---
IMH: defined as blood in the medial layer with intact overlying intima.
-Progression to dissection with development of an intimal tear and flow in a false lumen occurs in ~35%.
-Mgmt similar to that for dissection- surgery for IMH involving ascending Ao, medical management when localized to descending Ao.
-Surgical alternative is endograft placement, often requiring extensive coverage from subclavian to celiac due to lack of focality of IMH.
-Minimal balloon molding is important to avoid creating an intimal tear.

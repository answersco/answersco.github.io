title: "Performance and interpretation of captopril renogram"
---
Performed to assess for renal artery stenosis
Done in one of 2 ways (both using MAG3):
-1st is with standard dynamic study followed by ACE-Inh
-2nd is baseline study with 1/2 dose, then with full dose of ACE-inh.
Normal study = no difference between baseline and captopril studies.

Appearance of RAS depends on tracer
-DTPA (GFR tracer): sick kidney will have decreased uptake and flow, because of loss of perfusion pressure.
-MAG-3 (secreted tracer): sick kidney will have marked tracer retention, with curve similar to obstruction.

If bilateral up or bilateral down, it's not RAS.
If baseline study has asymmetrically poor function, that isn't positive for RAS- need to see it worsen (&gt; 10%)

Patients need to stop ACE-Inh 3-5 days prior to study
NPO for 6 hours for study (for PO meds)

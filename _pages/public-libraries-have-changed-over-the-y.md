title: "Public libraries have changed over the years."
---
Many years ago, libraries were silent places offering mostly books and newspapers. Today, we can find a variety of resources in libraries. In addition to regular books, libraries loan out books-on-tape, videotapes, and compact disks. Most libraries have replaced their card catalogs with computer catalogs. Shelves of current magazines and comfortable chairs encourage people to relax and stay a while. Children are welcomed to the library with brightly colored murals, puzzle tables, and story hours.

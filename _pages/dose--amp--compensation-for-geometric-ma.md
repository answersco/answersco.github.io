How to compensate for the blur caused by geometric magnification?
1. You can collimate which effectively changes to a smaller INPUT surface and therefore you get MAG and probs less blur from decreased area of irradiation

What is best position for II and xray tube:
- Want I.I. CLOSE to the patient and you want the x-ray tube FAR away 

3 things II close to patient does:
1. Decreases the patient dose (the ABC does not have to ramp dose as much because you have more incident xrays on the detector)
2. Decreases scatter to operator (basically this because the ABC is not having to increase the mA, i.e., there are just fewer Xrays)
3. Increases sharpness/spatial resolution (DECREASE magnification and blur)

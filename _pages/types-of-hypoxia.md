title: "Types of hypoxia"
---
1) Hypoxemia: low oxygen in blood

2) Circulatory hypoxemia: not good capillary circulation, often in diabetes

3) Anemia: do not have adequate hemoglobin, is what carries oxygen so if not enough hemoglobin to carry the oxygen then oxygen will decrease

4) Histotoxic: due to toxic substances like cyanide poisoning b/c it interferes with the tissues ability to use the oxygen

Imaging renal cortex- need agent that binds to cortex

Tc-DMSA: more commonly used tracer
-Binds to cortex and cleared very slowly
-Critical organ = KIDNEY (others are bladder)

Tc-Glucoheptonate (GH): less commonly used
-Binds to cortex, but also filtered so can be sued to assess renal flow, collecting system, and bladder
-Critical organ = bladder

DMSA preferred in cortical imaging of kids because lower dose to gonads (even though higher renal dose than Tc-GH).

title: "Bow Tie Filters: high or low z-materials? why?"
---
Bow-tie filters: compensate for uneven attenuation of beam by the patient
Attenuate less in center and more on the edges
Made of low-Z materials (like Teflon) to reduce hardening differences
Reduce scatter and dose

1. Compensate for uneven filtration 
2. reduce scatter
3. reduce dose

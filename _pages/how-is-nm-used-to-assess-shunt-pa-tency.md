Most commonly Tc-DTPA (or In-111-DTPA) injected into shunt tubing
Normal: shows tracer in peritoneum, confirming that the distal end is patent.
Can manually occlude the distal limb to force tracer into the ventricles- shows the proximal end is patent.

If tracer fails to reflux into ventricles, or it does but then doesn't clear, think proximal obstruction.

If there is delayed tracer flow into the peritoneum (&gt; 10 minutes = delayed), this can mean partial distal obstruction.

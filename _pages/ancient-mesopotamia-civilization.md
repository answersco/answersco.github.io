title: "Ancient Mesopotamia civilization"
---
This civilization was located in the Fertile Crescent between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, where early irrigation help agriculture emerge. Farming and access to resources such as iron led to the growth of civilizations, including the empires of the Babylonians, Sumerians, Hittites, and Akkadians. These civilizations developed complex cultures exemplified by social and political hierarchies centered on densly populated cities. Their achievements include monumental architecture such as pyramid-shaped temples called ziggurats, laws such as Hammurabi's Code, and literature such as the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh.&quot;

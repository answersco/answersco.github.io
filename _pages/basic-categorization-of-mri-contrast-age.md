Positive Contrast Materials &#8594; cause hyperintensity on T1-weighted images
Positive agent&#8594; stimulates an &#8593; in spin flip transitions&#8594; results in &#8595; T1 values and &#8593; brightness on T1-weighted images.
Also known as relaxation agents.
Negative Contrast Materials &#8594; produce substantial magnetic inhomogeneity due to magnetic susceptibility.
Magnetic susceptibility&#8594; perturbs the Larmor frequency of protons &#8594; results in a loss of phase coherence and &#8595; T2 values (hypointensity)
Negative agents&#8594; also known as shift agents, chemical shift agents, or frequency agents.

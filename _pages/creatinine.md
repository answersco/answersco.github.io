title: "Creatinine"
---
-more sensitive than BUN.
-byproduct of the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue.
-normal range: female 0.5-1.0 mg/dL and male 0.6-1.3 mg/dL

0.7-1.4 mg/dL
-if it is high, you have decreased kidney function, kidneys are not able to keep up with skeletal muscle breakdown
-people who have higher skeletal muscle have higher creatinine rates in their blood
-rhabdomyolysis can happen from trauma, often when someone falls in the shower and are not found for days so their skeletal muscles breakdown faster and their kidneys are not able to keep up so they start shutting down

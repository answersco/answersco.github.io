title: "Facilitated Diffusion"
---
-large molecules can diffuse through with help
1) A solute particle enters the channel of a membrane protein
2) The solute binds to a receptor site on the corner and the carrier changes conformation (temporary ionic bond causing the channel to change shape to let object through)
3) The carrier releases the solute on the other side of the membrane

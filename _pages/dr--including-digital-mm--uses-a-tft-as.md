title: "DR, including digital MM, uses a TFT as part of the detector. What is it?"
---
TFT is the array of light-sensitive detector elements and electronics that stores and reads out the electric charge from each detector element (del) after the exposure.

In a gamma camera, the PMT converts visible photons (produced in crystal detector) into electrons, and then amplifies the electron through a cascade dynode chain.

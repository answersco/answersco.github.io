Staging of Lung Cancer: now utilizes same TNM system for SCLC and NSCLC
Treatment based on staging:
For early stages up to IIB and sometimes IIIA, surgery is usually performed, possibly with adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy and XRT
Stage IIIB (N3- contralateral or supraclavicular nodes; or T4/N2) is considered unresectable.
Stage IV: generally not treated surgically unless solitary adrenal or brain metastasis.

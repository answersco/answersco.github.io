title: "Which way will the pineal gland be displaced with different masses?"
---
Because the pineal gland lies below the fornix, velum interpositum, and internal cerebral veins, masses in any of these structures will displace the pineal gland downwards. 

Masses in the tectal plate or midbrain will displace it superiorly.

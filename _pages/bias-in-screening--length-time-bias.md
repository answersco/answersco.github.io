title: "Bias in screening: Length-time bias"
---
Length-time bias: based on wide range of cancer growth rates
Screening tests: likely to find more slow-growing tumors since they are present for a longer period of time before they cause symptoms.
Since slow-growing tumors tend to be associated with better prognosis, screening tests tend to find tumors with inherently better prognosis
Usual medical care (as opposed to screening): tends to find a greater proportion of fast-growing tumors, since these are more likely to cause symptoms
Thus, the mortality rates of tumors found on screening may be better than those found in usual care, but this difference is not because of the screening itself

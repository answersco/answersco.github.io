title: "Which of the following is never found in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy? A) Asymmetrical hypertrophy, worse in the septum B) Flow void on gradient echo imaging in the region of the left ventricular outflow tract C) Decreased velocity in the left ventricular outflow tract on VENC imaging D) Abnormal myocardial strain E) Mitral regurgitation"

C. Decreased velocity in the LVOT on VENC imaging. The velocity in the LVOT may be normal or increased. When the LVOT velocity is increased, it is due to abnormal narrowing of the LVOT by septal hypertrophy.

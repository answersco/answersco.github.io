title: "Spatial resolution"
---
Scintillators emit light isotropically, which can reduce ____

Important in FluorCT (less has is ok), cardiac and angio CT
Cardiac: &lt;70 bpm, RR interval
Gantry speed

Determined by voxel size (smaller voxel -&gt; better resolution)
Voxel = Slice thickness x FOV / Matrix size

Improved with:
- smaller voxel
-- smaller FOV
-- larger matrix
-- thinner slices
-- steep slice selection gradient
-- thin transmit bandwidth

title: "UAE embolization"

-Uterine arteries can be selected with an angled 4- or 5-French catheter (e.g. Cobra), but spasm can be a problem, so microcatheters are often preferred.
-Embo material: commonly permanent particles in 300- to 1200-um range (irregular or spheres).
-Vascularity of fibroids and risk of nontarget embo (especially reflux into ovarian artery collaterals) determines choice of embolic size.
-Bilateral embo is mandatory unless there is convincing evidence of unilateral supply to fibroids.
-Contralateral access can usually be accomplished via Waltman loop or selecting the ipsilateral IIA with a recurved access. Bilateral femoral artery access can also be used.

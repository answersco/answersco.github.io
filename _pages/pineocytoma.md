title: "Pineocytoma"
---
Most commonly seen in adults (women more than men). Usually well demarcated, noninvasive, and slow growing. Often calcified. Rarely metastasizes. At imaging, can't be differentiated from pineal germinoma or pineoblastoma.

Best diagnostic clue
Circumscribed pineal mass that &quot;explodes&quot; pineal calcification peripherally
May mimic pineal cyst, pineal parenchymal tumor of intermediate differentiation (PPTID)
Location
Pineal region
Rarely extends into 3rd ventricle
Rarely invasive
May compress adjacent structures
Rarely, associated hydrocephalus if aqueduct compression
Size
Typically less than 3 cm
Morphology
Demarcated round or lobular mass

Rare in childhood
Well circumscribed, non invasive 
More solid, and solid components enhacne
They have more peripheral calcifications

old people, well-circumscribed, non-invasive, solid &amp; enhancing, PERIPHERAL calcs

title: "Tungsten target interactions?"
---
The primary charged particle interaction that occurs in the tungsten target is 'excitation', accounting for more than 99% of the interactions. This produces large amounts of infrared radiation (heat) which must be dissipated in order to prevent damage to the tube. Ionization events account for only 0.10 to 0.15% of the electron-target interactions, resulting in characteristic x-rays. The primary x-ray generating interaction in a tungsten target x-ray tube is Bremsstrahlung (radiative losses), which accounts for 85 - 90% of the x-ray beam content (0.8 - 0.9 % of charged particle interactions). The energy of bremsstrahlung-generated x-rays can range from 0 keV to kVp applied between the cathode and the anode.

title: "What is the most prevalent type of interaction in human soft tissue for 100 kV x-rays?"
---
Compton scattering.
The mass attenuation coefficient (MAC) of Compton scattering in soft tissue increases with photon energy from 10-35 keV, and then decreases very slowly with photon energy increasing from 35 to 150 keV. 
Conversely, as photon energy increases from 10 to 150 keV, the MAC of the photoelectric effect decreases rapidly.
The crossover point in human tissue is around 30 keV (~60 kV depending on x-ray beam quality).
For diagnostic x-rays, Compton scattering is the more probable interaction above 60 kV and is the dominant interaction for 140 keV and 511 keV photons (corresponding to Tc99m and annihilation gamma x-rays associated with positron emitters such as F18).

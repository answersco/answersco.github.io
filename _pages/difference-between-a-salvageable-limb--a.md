title: "Difference between a salvageable limb &amp; salvageable limb with IMMEDIATE intervention?"
---
1. Salvageable limb has intact but slow capillary return WITHOUT muscle paralysis. 
** Both have partial sensory loss, absent arterial doppler, and positive venous doppler.

2. for IMMEDIATE intervention, capillary return may be absent and there is PARTIAL MUSCLE PARALYSIS.

(3. Non-salvage = complete muscle paralysis and sensory loss w/o capillary return, arterial, or venous waveforms)

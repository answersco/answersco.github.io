The examination allows you to calculate a T score (based on sex and ethnicity)
The test is to be used in post menopausal women OR men &gt; 50

T score 
&gt;/= -1 is normal
&lt; -1 but &gt; -2.5 is osteopenia
&lt;/= - 2.5 is osteoporosis

Z score: This takes into account an age, sex, and ethnicity matched control (the T score did not take into account age match)
- This is used in PREmenopausal women and men YOUNGER than 50

Zscore &lt; -2 is abnormal and a cause should be sought

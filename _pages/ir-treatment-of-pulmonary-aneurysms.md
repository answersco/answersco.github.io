Symptomatic peripheral PA aneurysms (true or false) can be safely embolized in a manner similar to AVM.
Feasibility increases as the aneurysm becomes more peripheral, as central aneurysms are often too large for embolic materials or involve major proximal branches.

Unlike AVM, risk of paradoxical embo is low.
Fragile vasculitic aneurysms and PSAs more prone to rupture during manipulation.
Selective catheter should be used to deposit coils or plugs in the feeding artery. 
Because PAs are essentially end arteries, there is no concern for retrograde perfusion of the aneurysm. 
In some cases, coils can be gently packed into the aneurysm to promote thrombosis.

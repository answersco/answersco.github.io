HCC: AFP elevated in 75% of cases
Arterial phase enhancement is the characteristic imaging feature
However, 10-20% of HCCs are hypovascular&#8594; thus slightly hypoenhancing relative to surrounding liver in arterial phase
Classic CT/MRI appearance: encapsulated mass that enhances on arterial phase and washes out on PV phase images.
Unenhanced MRI: HCC characteristically slightly hyperintense to surrounding liver on T2W images.
Nodule within a nodule appearance: enhancing nodule within a dysplastic nodule, representing early HCC

art +C &amp; washout, tumor thrombus enlargement PV, hi T2

T1-Iso to hypo
T2- Iso to mild hyper
Early enhancement and washout on delayed and mild enhancement of fibrous capsule on hepatocyte

Cirrhosis: alpha-1 anti-trypsin, glycogen storage ds, tyrosinemia, biliary atresia, chronic viral hepatitis

Elevated AFP (hepatoblastoma too)

Early enhancement and rapid washout. Venus tumor thrombus

focal gallium uptake- unlikely HCC if not present

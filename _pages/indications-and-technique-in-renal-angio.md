Angio: obtained when the diagnosis of a correctable vascular injury is uncertain, ongoing retroperitoneal bleeding amenable to embo, or persistent hematuria.

Selective embo of extravasation, pseudoaneurysms, and AVF is efficacious and spares renal parenchyma.
Permanent agents that can be precisely deposited (such as coils or glue) are typically used.
Main renal artery dissections and obstructive intimal flaps may permit treatment with stents or stent-grafts.

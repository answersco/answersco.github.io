title: "Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone mechanism"
---
-a system of hormones that helps control blood pressure and GFR
1) in response to a drop in blood pressure, baroreceptors in carotid and aorta stimulate the sympathetic nervous system
2) sympathetic fibers trigger release of renin by kidneys' granular cells 
3) renin converts angiotensinogen, a blood protein, into angiotensin I
4) angiotensin I converted by ACE in lungs and kidneys to angiotensin II
5) angiotensin II causes aldosterone release

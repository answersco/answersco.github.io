title: "Odds ratio"
---
A measure of the relative risk of the occurrence of an event.
 = Odds of exposure in CASES / odds of exposure in CONTROLS

Cases WITH exposure X Controls WITHOUT Exposure / Controls WITH exposure X Cases WITHOUT exposure

- measure of association between an exposure and an outcome
- (A x C)/(B x D) = (cases exposed x control not exposed) / (control exposed x cases not exposed)
- if ratio = 1 then NOT related to the disease
- if ration &gt; 1 then the risk factor is found more frequently among the cases than the controls
- if ratio &lt; 1 then the risk factor may actually be a protective factor against the disease
- must be used instead of relative risk when analyzing CASE-CONTROL data

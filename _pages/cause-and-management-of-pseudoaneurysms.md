Anastomotic pseudoaneurysm should raise suspicion of infection.
Pseudoaneurysms in renal parenchyma are usually related to biopsy.
Embo is preferred treatment, allowing maximal sparing of renal parenchyma.
Use of superselective coaxial microcatheters permits precise deployment of microcoils or glue near origin of pseudoaneurysm.

AVF in transplant also usually due to biopsy.
Treatment is also embo.

title: "What sequence best differentiates PVNS from amyloid arthropathy secondary to chronic renal disease?"
---
Answer: gradient-echo
Like PVNS, amyloid arthropathy tends to be low signal on both T1 and T2-weighted images.
However, amyloid arthropathy does not demonstrate the blooming artifact on GRE that is seen in PVNS due to hemosiderin. 
PVNS and amyloid both show variable patterns of enhancement, so post-contrast imaging is not useful in distinguishing the two entities.

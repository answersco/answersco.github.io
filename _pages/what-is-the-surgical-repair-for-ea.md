title: "What is the surgical repair for EA?"
---
1) esophageal anastomosis (primary closure) and
2) resection of the fistula.

Delayed repair will include gastrostomy, fistulectomy, creation of a fistula from the proximal esophagus to the neck, and later anastomosis at 3 to 12 months (when the child is stable). 

In cases of long segment stenosis when a primary anastamosis is not possible, the surgeon may construct a conduit from stomach (gastric tube) or from colon.

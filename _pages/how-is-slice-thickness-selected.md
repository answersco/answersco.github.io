title: "How is slice-thickness selected?"
---
Slice Thickness&#8594; adjusted by the strength of the gradient and the transmit RF bandwidth.
Stronger gradients = thinner slices
Thicker slices&#8594; result in more tissue averaging within an image voxel&#8594; blurring with increasing thickness.
If the RF pulse is a very narrow bandwidth (close to zero), then the slice will be diminishingly thin.

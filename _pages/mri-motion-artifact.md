title: "MRI motion artifact"
---
Motion Artifact&#8594; appears as a general blurring of the MRI image, and/or with copies of structures (e.g. vessels, cavity boundaries) duplicated along the phase-encode direction.
Origin: periodic motion faster than the time between different phase encodings.
Motion other than pulsatile flow results in blurring.
One image-formation based technique to identify this artifact is to invert the phase-encode and frequency-encode direction&#8594; motion artifact will flip positions after this inversion of axes.

title: "Experimental studies (randomized controlled trials)"
---
In clinical trials, the investigator applies an intervention and evaluates the effect on outcome
Major advantages of a trial over an observational study (e.g. case-control, cross-sectional, cohort): 
Ability to demonstrate causality
Eliminate confounders
Minimize some biases
Random assignment of subjects helps eliminate confounding variables since these should be distributed equally (by chance) between groups
Blinding: helps minimize treatment differences between groups as well as biased assessment of outcomes.

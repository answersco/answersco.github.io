title: "Internal conversion? (CE)"
---
Alternative to gamma decay, a nucleus may release energy by imparting it directly to a K or L e- and ejecting it from the atom if the energy is sufficient to overcome the binding energy of the e-. The energy excess above the binding energy becomes the kinetic energy of the conversion e-. The conversion e- (or CE) has discrete energy due to electron shells.
 
The inner vacancy left by the conversion e- is subsequently filled by an outer-shell e-. This transition results in emission of characteristic x-rays or Auger e-. Z, N, A all stay the same.

title: "Organizing Pneumonia"
---
Called Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia if the cause is NOT known
This is one of the ways the lung responds to injury (it is not the CAUSE of the disease)
Many things cause organizing pneumonia such as drugs, infection, amiodarone, collagen vascular disease, fumes, etc

Findings:
- Patchy consolidation or GGO (90%) in a peripheral or PERIBRONCHIAL distribution
- Other classic finding is the REVERSE HALO sign or atol sign (consolidation with internal ground glass)

*<b>NOTE</b>* Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia looks the EXACT same. These are in the same differential.

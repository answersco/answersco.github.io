title: "Great Radprimer Question: Showed Type 1 chemical shift and asked what the effect is when you change the parameter to decrease this artifact?"

You have to increase the receiver bandwidth to decrease chemical shift. (this will lead to shorter read out time, and deceased metal artifact too)

Therefore, you Decrease your SNR (you will sample more noise). 

See RP 5a 4/15/17

title: "CTA: spatial and temporal resolution, and stenosis classification"
---
Spatial resolution:
CT has isotropic voxel resolution of 0.35-0.5mm, which allows only 6 to 9 voxels to image the entire coronary artery lumen. This is insufficient resolution to grade a stenosis with accuracy greater than ~20% of the vessel diameter.
In contrast, catheter angiography has spatial resolution of ~ 0.16 mm, to depict the average lumen of a coronary artery over ~ 18 pixels.
Due to limited spatial resolution of CT, stenosis is classified into categories:
&lt;20%
20-50%
50-70%
&gt;70%
A 50% stenosis is considered potentially hemodynamically significant.

Temporal resolution:
CT scanner requires slightly more than 180 degrees of gantry rotation for image acquisition: for a complete rotation time of 330 ms, the temporal resolution is ~175 ms
Dual-source CT: 2 x-ray sources oriented at 90 degrees to each other, and only needs to rotate 90 degrees to complete a reconstruction, with a temporal resolution of ~75 ms.

Procedure: HR &lt; 60 bpm desired in order to maximize RR interval
PO metoprolol (5-25 mg in 5 mg doses) used to decrease heart rate&#8594; better HR control and less variability than IV.
Sublingual nitroglycerin (0.5-0.8 mg) given just prior to scanning to dilate coronary arteries.

title: "Intensifying screen films types are used in which kind of imaging?"
---
- Fast for Abdominal
- Slow for Extremity (less motion there)
- Single-Emulsion screen cassette for Mammo

* Note that increasing screen thickness INCREASES the speed (good for abdominal XR with more susceptibility to movement)

* Faster speed screens require LOWER air kerma of the incident XR beam (because they can catch it so quickly!)

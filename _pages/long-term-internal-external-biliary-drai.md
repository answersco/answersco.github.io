title: "Long-term internal/external biliary drainage: indications, catheters, technique, follow-up"
---
Long-term int/ext biliary drainage catheters may be used after balloon dilatation of anastomotic strictures and in patients with duodenal encasement from pancreatic carcinoma where a metal stent can't be placed.

Usually a 10 or 12-Fr catheter rather than the 8.3 Fr Ring catheter placed at initial biliary drainage.
-When the 12-Fr catheter is palced, it is left to free drainage for 1-2 days and then clamped as long as patient is afebrile. If patient tolerates clamping, he/she can be discharged.
-Catheter needs replacement every 2-3 months, or sooner if catheter occlusion or fever occurs.

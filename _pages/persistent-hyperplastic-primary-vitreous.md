title: "Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV)"
---
Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV) &#8594; persistent embryonic vasculature within the vitreous that leads to loss of vision from hemorrhage, cataracts, and retinal detachment. Infants typically full-term.
Imaging: microphthalmia, with &#8593; attenuation of the vitreous.
Distinguished from Rb and ROP by the absence of calcifications.

Blindness
leukocoria
microopthalmia (small globe)
NO calcifications

usually unilateral
associated with ocular dysplasias
 Norrie's disease: PHPV, seizures, deafness, low IQ

Persistent fetal blood supply within the orbit
It can lead to retinal detachment

Look for small eye on the effected side with INCREASE density of the vitrous (is not going to lose signal on flair, going to be INCREASED signal on T1)

Image is a T1

- failure of the embryonic ocular blood supply to regress
- complication is retinal detachment

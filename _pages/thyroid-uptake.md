title: "Thyroid Uptake"
---
We use I-123
Uptake calculation:
Neck count - background
 needle dose

Normal thyroid uptake:

- 2 hr - 5-10%
- 24h - 10-35%

Patient preparation:
** Antithyroid drugs (ex PTU) should be discontinued 5 to 7 days (can get sudden rebound of hormone synthesis after withdrawal of antithyroid drugs)
** Amiodarone should be d/c'd for 1 week before (contains iodine, can saturate receptors and give an abnormally low value)
** Synthroid should be d/c'd for 3 weeks before b/c suppresses TSH, would cause abnormally low value
** No recent contrasted CT scans (saturates I receptors)

Focal uptake: could be cancer- requires further workup

Diffuse uptake: usually autoimmune (Hashi) thyroiditis

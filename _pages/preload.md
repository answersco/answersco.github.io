title: "Preload"
---
end-diastolic volume - the amount of blood left in the left ventricle

-another name is end diastolic volume - what's getting returned back to the heart from the body
-is important bc the greater the end diastolic volume, the greater the stretch in the cardiac fibers meaning the harder ejection your going to have
-factors that impact: blood volume, ventricular compliance, length of time the heart has to fill up, and vascularity (contracted tight vascular means more will be returned (increased preload), if dilated there will not be enough pressure to move blood to the heart)

-the amount of tension in ventricular myocardium immediately before it begins to contract
-increased preload causes increased force of contraction
-exercise increases venous return and stretches myocardium
-cardiocytes generate more tension during contraction
-increased cardiac output matches increased venous return

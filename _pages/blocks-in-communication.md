title: "Blocks in communication"
---
1) rescue feelings/codependency
2) false reassurance: everything will be okay, don't worry, you have the best doctor on the planet - integrity is out the window if what you say comes as false
3) giving advice or sharing personal opinions: &quot;if I were you&quot;, inhibits facilitative problem solving -- do not make it your problem
4) changing the subject: get someone who is better suited for the conversation instead of changing the subject
5) being moralistic
6) asking for explanations: why? questions are bad, they get defensive

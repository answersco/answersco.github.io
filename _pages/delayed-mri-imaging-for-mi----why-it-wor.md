title: "Delayed MRI imaging for MI: - why it works (2 reasons) -- hint: has to do with contrast distribution - what technique is used to null myocardium?"
---
Why it works:
- increased contrast in acute myocardial infarction tissue
- scarred myocardium washes out slowly

- inversion recovery technique to null normal myocardium followed by a gradient echo sequence

- Bright myocardium is dead

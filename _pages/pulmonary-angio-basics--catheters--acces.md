title: "Pulmonary angio basics: catheters, access, injection rate"
---
Access: femoral &gt; IJ
Catheters: selective pulmonary angiography requires large pigtail catheters (6-7 French) that can tolerate high flow rates without whipping in the artery or unwinding.
Pressure measurements obtained in PA before contrast injection
Typical rate: 25-30 mL/sec for 2 seconds
Rapid filming (at least 4 frames/sec) required
Continue imaging into venous phase to evaluate PVs

In patients with uncompensated PaHTN, the rate and volume of contrast should be reduced to avoid acute right heart failure.
-Slow flow and delayed washout of test contrast in PAs in setting of normal or elevated heart rate suggests severe RV impairment.

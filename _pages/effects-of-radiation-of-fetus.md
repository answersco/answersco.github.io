title: "Effects of radiation of fetus"

Teratogenicity is dose and timing dependent (remember fetus is more suscebtable at certain times)
- First 2 weeks of pregnancy = 50-100mGy MAY cause fetal loss. This is ALL OR NOTHING. If the baby is not lost, then it will be completely fine
- 8-15 weeks = most vulnerable time of exposure to radiation, doses over 100-200 Gy are associated with mental retardation
- It only takes a few radiographs worth of dose in the fetus to increase risk of leukemia

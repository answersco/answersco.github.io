title: "Environmental adaptation"
---
This phenomenon allowed certain peoples to interact with their environments in new ways as the climate shifted at the end of the Ice Age about 10,000 years ago. Some ancient peoples developed nomadic pastoralism, or migratory herding, while other began settled agriculture. These adaptations led to great and more reliable food production, which in turn created food surpluses, new types of specialized jobs, and the growth of hieracrchal social organization.

Hypereosinophilic endomyocardial fibrosis is a type of RCM in which there is extensive endomyocardial fibrosis, often accompanied by an apical thrombus containing eosinophils. The fibrosis itself may be seen as a dark apical rim on gradient echo sequences. Often a thrombus is present in the LV apex.

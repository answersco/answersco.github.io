title: "Takayasu arteritis and main differential:"
---
Takayasu arteritis (AKA pulseless disease): idiopathic, inflammatory, large-vessel vasculitis that involves the thoracic and abdominal aorta, subclavian arteries, carotids, pulmonary arteries, and large mesenteric arteries.
Usually affects young to middle-aged women
Imaging:
Features long, smooth stenoses. 
Imaging is often indistinguishable from giant cell arteritis, usually distinguished by patient age. Takayasu arteritis occurs in relatively younger patients, while giant cell arteritis is rare under age 50.
During acute phase, treatment is with steroids. Endovascular treatment can be performed for symptomatic stenoses, but only after active inflammation has resolved, measured by ESR.

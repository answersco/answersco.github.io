title: "Mechanism and probability of Compton scatter"

Compton Scattering (bad): 
X-ray hits an outer shell electron&#8594; outer shell electron is ejected&#8594; incoming x-ray/photon (now with less energy) changers direction and flies off

Produces 3 things:
Free electron
Ionized atom (missing an electron)
Photon of energy

Probability of Compton scatter: 
Does NOT depend on the Z of the atom because the energy of these outer shell electrons is low
Depends on the density of the material (more tightly packed atoms = more electrons to crash into)
Above 25-30 k

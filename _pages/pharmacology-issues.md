1) Pharmacokinetic alterations
-focus on creatinine clearance, absorption of iron decreases so they may be anemic

2) Impact of concurrent conditions and therapy
-difficult to find the medication causing a specific side effect due to polypharmacy

3) Adverse drug reactions (more likely to happen in older adults) and iatrogenesis (given something therapeutic but creating an ill side effect)

4) Use of OTC, alternative, and complementary
-herbal or natural does not mean safe and can cause interactions with other medications

5) Beers List
-list of inappropriate medications for use in older adults as low-risk or high-risk 
-those labeled high-risk need to look for alternative but if not available then need to consider risks vs. benefits

6) Financial
-insurance only pays for certain kinds or certain brands - does not always cover anything
-causes people to split dose in half to last longer or stop taking the medication entirely
-&quot;Drug clubs&quot; - trading with other older adults

7) Adherence and compliance related to self-management
-happens when older adults go home
-prescription education needs to be on going - stubborn ones will decide what they think is best for them
-over-medicating and under-medicating can happen when meds may change and they go home

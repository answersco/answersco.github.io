title: "Prevalence effect of PPV and NPV"
---
IF a disease is HIGHLY PREVALENT then the PPV will go UP because there is JUST A LOT OF DISEASE in the population
(If an ABI says a diabetic smoker has PAD then its probably right!)

IF a disease is NOT AT ALL prevalent then you PPV is going to do down!
(If an ABI says a 25 yo track runner has PAD then it's probably WRONG!)

title: "Artifacts associated with beam hardening in CT"

Beam hardening: as x-ray beam passes through an object the lower energy photons are removed preferentially &#8594; leaves a harder beam with increased average energy
Cupping: x-rays passing through the middle of a uniform shape (e.g. head) are hardened more than those at periphery (shorter path)
Center of image appears darker than periphery

Dark bands/streak: occurs in the setting of 2 dense objects
X-rays that pass through one are less attenuated than objects that pass through both
Result in dark bands and streaks between those objects
Classic location in bone or where dense contrast was used

title: "MRI in acute MI: - how soon can it be done after MI? - characteristic pattern of enhancement? - Microvascular obstruction? - T2 bright + enhanced = (dead/salvageable) tissue"
---
- Can be done in first 24 hours if stable.

Characteristic pattern: 
- zone of enhancement that extends from subendocardium toward epicardium in vascular distribution

Microvascular obstruction (MVO): 
- islands of dark signal in enhanced tissue
- an acute/subacute finding (NOT in chronic disease)
- Best seen on 1st pass imaging (25 seconds)
- turn into scar.

Acute setting (1 week): 
 -T2 bright and enhanced = salvageable tissue
- injured myocardium is T2 bright and can be used to estimate area at risk

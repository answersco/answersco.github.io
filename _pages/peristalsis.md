the wavelike contraction of the walls of the intestines which propels contents onward

-movement of digestive material through digestive tract under control of the nervous system
-involuntary control is sacral reflex that is managed by stretch receptors in the rectum - senses the rectum is stretching or filling up so it sends a message to your brain to manage the voluntary control of defecation reflex
-contractions occur every 3 to 12 minutes
-mass peristalsis sweeps occur one to four times each 24-hour period - i.e. bowel movements
-one-third to one-half of food waste is excreted in stool within 24 hours

rhythmic pulsating contraction such as the large intestine digesting food

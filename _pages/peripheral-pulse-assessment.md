title: "Peripheral pulse assessment"
---
-all sites noted in vital signs slides
-done to make sure we have adeduate perfusion in the body
-include brachial, radial, femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and dorsalispedis
-evaluated systematically and bilaterally for equality and symmetry
-unlike the radial and apical pulses, peripheral pulses are measured and documented according to strength

0=absent and requires further assessment using a Doppler
+1=thready, barely palpable
+2=easily palpable, normal
+3 or +4=bounding pulse

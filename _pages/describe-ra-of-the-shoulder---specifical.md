title: "Describe RA of the shoulder - specifically, where do erosions occur, and what classic image of the humerus is seen in these cases?"
---
Erosions tend to occur in the LATERAL ASPECT of the humeral heads. This causes the classic &quot;high riding&quot; humerus

Erosions also occur in the AC joints. When this happens, erosions may lead to &quot;penciling&quot; of the distal clavicle

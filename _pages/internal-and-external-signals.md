1) intrinsic: cycle/kinase ration -- Cyclin levels vary throughout the cycle where kinase levels remain the same. Different cyclin-kinase pairs active genes that trigger mitosis. As mitosis begin cyclin is degraded and a new cycle begins.
2) extrinsic: hormones, growth factors, crowding (contact with another cell can stunt cell production)

title: "Gradient Recalled Echo (GRE) technique:"
---
GE starts with a small (&lt;90&#176;) excitation pulse &#8594; tips longitudinal magnetization, creating some transverse magnetization in a selected slice.
Phase and frequency gradient pulses&#8594; used to codify the spatial location in a selected slice.
Negative frequency gradient pulse is applied&#8594; causes rapid dephasing of transverse magnetization.
Positive frequency gradient pulse then rephases transverse magnetization &#8594; produces a &quot;gradient&quot; echo at TE.
Gradient recalled echoes are also called &quot;field echoes.&quot;
The sequence must be repeated for each line of k-space.

title: "How to distinguish Bartholin gland cysts from Gardner duct cysts?"
---
Look for the pubic symphysis!

Bartholin is BELOW the pubic symphysis and near the Butt (e.g. posterolateral lower 1/3 vagina, associated with labia)

Gardner's duct is up higher in the upper anterior vagina

(SKene's duct = also below pubic symphysis bc related to the &quot;SKinny urethra&quot;)

See RP 17a 4/20

title: "Arterial supply of the foot: PT"
---
PT passes posterior and inferior to the medial malleolus, and then bifurcates into the medial and lateral plantar arteries.
-Lateral plantar artery (usually larger of the 2) takes a diagonal course across the plantar aspect of the foot.
-Lateral plantar artery forms a second, deep plantar arch that supplies the plantar metatarsal arteries. This arch anastomoses with the deep plantar branch of the DP artery between the 1st and 2nd MTs.
-Medial plantar artery travels inferior to the 1st MT bone to supply the great toe.

title: "What artifact is generated when gradients are rapidly turned on and off?"
---
Eddy currents: can be located in the magnet, the cables, the wires, or even the patient
-Looks like distortion (contraction or dilation of image) or shift/shear
-Most severe with DWI pulses
-Improved by optimizing the sequence of gradient pulses.

title: "Methods of &#8595; SAR:"
---
The use of quadrature coils (circularly polarizing or CP) rather than linear coils for transmission of RF &#8594; &#8595; SAR by approximately &#189;
&#8595; flip angle for refocusing pulses (i.e. using 160&#176; rather than 180&#176; RF pulses for spin echo sequences) &#8594; especially effective for fast spin echo sequences.
&#8593; (lengthening TR) &#8594; thereby &#8595; the duty cycle.
Imaging fewer slices per TR or overall sequence.
&#8595; the echo train length (turbo factor) with fast or turbo spin echo sequences.
If possible, avoiding use of the body (bore) transmit coil when other transmit/receive coils may be substituted (e.g. head or knee).

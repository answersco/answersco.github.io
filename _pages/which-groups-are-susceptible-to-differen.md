Aspergilloma = Prior lung disease (TB, sarcoid, CF)

ABPA = asthmatics (finger in Glove)

Semi-Invasive aspergillosis = mildly compromised immune systems (Alcoholics &amp; Diabetics)
- nodules or consolidation near prior scarring

Angio-invasive = Severely neutropenic (post BMT, AML patients)
- CT halo, Air crescent, and peripheral wedge-like consolidations
* Air crescent sign indicates that the neutropenia has resolved and patient is mounting a response against the infxn by &quot;walling it off&quot;

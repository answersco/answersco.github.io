Pyogenic discitis/osteomyelitis&#8594; most commonly staph aureus
Adults&#8594; the vascularized subchondral bone is the initial site of infection
Children&#8594; intervertebral disc is initially infected, with subsequent spread to the endplates.
Key imaging feature: marrow hypointensity on T1-weighted images centered on both sides of an abnormal intervertebral disc that is hyperintense on T2-weighted images.
Usually with loss of adjacent endplate definition, +/- paraspinal/epidural soft tissue infection.

Tuberculous osteomyelitis (Pott disease)
Unlike pyogenic discitis/osteomyelitis, the discs are usually spared in tuberculous infection.
Classically causes wedge-shaped compression of the anterior aspect of the vertebral body&#8594; often leading to a gibbus deformity centered at the infected vertebra.

title: "Balloon dilatation of esophageal strictures- technique"
---
Barium swallow performed the day before the procedure if not performed recently.
-5-French angiographic catheter and hydrophilic guidewire are used to enter esophagus.
-Catheter and guidewire are manipulated to a level just above the stricture. 
-Small amount of contrast injected to outline the proximal end of the stricture.
-Guidewire and catheter are manipulated beyond stricture into the stomach.
-Guidewire exchanged for an exchange length stiff wire (180 or 260 cm).
-Depending on the stricture, start with a 10 or 12-mm balloon, with ultimate goal of luminal diameter of 20 mm. Can start small, and work your way up to 15 and 20 mm balloons. If the patient has significant discomfort with 10 or 12-mm balloon, the session is terminated for the day.
-Balloon is left inflated for 1-2 minutes until the waist disappears.
-Esophagram performed in 6-12 hours (stricture tends to look like predilatation stricture when performed immediately after procedure).

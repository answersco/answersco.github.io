Junctional parenchymal defect in renal imaging refers to a sonographic variant in kidney. It is a triangular echogenic area frequently seen in upper lobe parenchyma.

It is the extension of sinus fat into the cortex, dividing distinctly upper and lower pole of kidneys. It results from embryonic fusion of renunculi.

It will be seen to arise in cortical region, characteristically in anterior and superior location and in continuity with sinus fat

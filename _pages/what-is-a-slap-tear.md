title: "What is a SLAP tear?"
---
Superior labrum anterior posterior. Centered on attachment of biceps tendon which inserts on ant sup labrum.

A superior labrum anterior posterior (SLAP) tear is an anterior-posterior oriented tear of the superior labrum centered at the attachment of the biceps tendon.

- Important: when SLAP occurs at the biceps anchor, you must not only debride, but also do BICEPS TENODESIS (anchor the biceps tendon into the joint)

- SLAP occurs with overhead movement (e.g. swimmer)

- not usually associated with instability

- Mimicked by Sublabral recess

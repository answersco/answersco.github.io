title: "Translation elongation"

The large ribosomal subunit joins: 

a) 2nd tRNA binds to next mRNA codon
b) 1st peptide bond forms between the two amino acids - catalyzed by an rRNA ribozyme (forms 1st peptide bond)
c) tRNAs bring in more amino acids, as the ribosome moves down the mRNA
 -- P (peptide) site bears polypeptide
 chain
 -- A (arrive) site holds the newest tRNA

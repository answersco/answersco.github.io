title: "What is the Moir&#233; artifact in CR?"
---
Regularly spaced diagonal lines across the image. Moir&#233; artifact occurs when grids with low grid frequencies are used that are oriented parallel to the plate readers scan lines. To avoid this artifact, grids with a frequency of at least 60/cm should be used, oriented perpendicular to the plate readers scan lines.

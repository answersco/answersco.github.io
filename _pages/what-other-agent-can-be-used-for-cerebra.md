title: "What other agent can be used for cerebral blood flow?"
---
Tc99m-DTPA
-Does not cross BBB- thus can't be used for brain parenchymal imaging, and CANNOT DO SPECT
-Advantage over HMPAO/ECD: can be repeated without delay

Tc DTPA
- does NOT cross the blood brain barrier --&gt; cannot be used for brain parenchymal imaging
- advantage: can be repeated without delay (because it doesn't bind to brain tissue)

Cannot be used for SPECT or evaluation of posterior fossa

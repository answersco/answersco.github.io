title: "What findings can distinguish ABC from a malignant lesion with fluid-fluid levels?"
---
Fluid-fluid levels: characteristically seen with ABC and telangiectatic osteosarcoma.

Imaging features that favor telangiectatic osteosarcoma over ABC include 1. Thick nodular septations and a surrounding soft tissue component (best demonstrated on CT or MRI following contrast administration) 2. Matrix mineralization in the lesion 3. Cortical destruction or other aggressive features

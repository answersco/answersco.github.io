Positioning: want x-ray tube far away, and II as close as possible to the patient

Placing II as close as possible to the patient has several effects:
Decreases patient dose
Decreases scatter to the operator
Increases image sharpness
Decreases focal spot blur and magnification

Raising the image receptor &#8594; Increases the dose to compensate for the source to image receptor distance.

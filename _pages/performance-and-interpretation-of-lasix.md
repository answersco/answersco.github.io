title: "Performance and interpretation of lasix renogram"
---
Performed same as standard dynamic exam, with 30 minute wait after clearance. If still activity in collecting system, challenge performed with Lasix. 
Study can be done with MAG-3 or DTPA- MAG-3 does better with patients with poor renal function and is thus used more commonly.

No obstruction = tracer clears without need for Lasix
No obstruction = washout of 50% of tracer from collecting system within 10 minutes of lasix administration.
Indeterminate = washout of 50% of tracer within 10-20 minutes of Lasix administration. Most common cause for this is very dilated pelvis and &quot;reservoir&quot; effect.
Obstructed = washout &gt; 20 minutes after lasix.

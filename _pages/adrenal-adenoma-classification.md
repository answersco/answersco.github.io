title: "Adrenal adenoma classification:"
---
Adrenal nodule attenuation &lt; 10 HU can be reliably diagnosed as adenoma, requiring no further imaging or follow-up
80% are lipid-rich, and attenuate below this cutoff
20% lipid-poor: attenuate &gt; 10 HU, and can't be diagnosed on NECT
Indeterminate (&gt; 10 HU) small, homogeneous adrenal lesion in absence of known malignancy almost certainly represents lipid-poor adenoma
Collision tumor: metastasis into an adrenal gland with pre-existing adenoma&#8594; should be considered for heterogeneity or interval enlargement even if a region attenuates &lt; 10 HU

title: "What does breast compression do in physics?"
---
Reduces focal spot blur and image magnification, Reduces dose, and allows lower kV

Also reduces exposure times

Reduces focal spot blur
REDUCES GEOMETRIC MAGNIFICATION (by smashing breast closer to bucky) 
Reduces dose
Allows lower kV

Also reduces exposure times

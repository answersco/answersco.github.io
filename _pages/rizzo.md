case that tells us about the ACT REQUIREMENT for attempt via the DANGEROUS PROXIMITY test; defendants not guilty of attempt to commit robbery b/c they never found/reached person they intended to rob; acts must come VERY NEAR to accomplishment of intended crime: Was there a reasonable likelihood of accomplished crime but for the interference? Distance must be relatively short; we're preserving the defendant's opportunity to change mind and repent

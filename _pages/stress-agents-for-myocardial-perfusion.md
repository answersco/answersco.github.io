Dipyridamole stress&#8594; pharmacologic vasodilator
Mechanism: dipyridamole is an adenosine deaminase inhibitor
&#8593; endogenous adenosine (vasodilator) &#8594; &#8593; coronary blood flow by 3-5X.
Critical coronary stenosis&#8594; cannot further dilate in response to adenosine&#8594; relative perfusion defect on stress imaging.
Unlike physical stress, dipyridamole stress does not &#8593; cardiac work or O2 demand.
Caffeine and theophylline reverse the effects of dipyridamole&#8594; must be held for 24 hours
Antidote = aminophylline (100-200 mg)
Shorter half-life than dipyridamole&#8594; patient must be continuously monitored.
Adenosine stress &#8594; pharmacologic vasodilator
Identical physiologic effects as dipyridamole&#8594; but more rapid effect
Adenosine half-life ~ 30 seconds&#8594; thus does not require a reversal agent.
Regadenoson &#8594; pharmacologic vasodilator
Adenosine-receptor agonist with 2-3 minute half-life
Easier to administer than adenosine, with a convenient universal-dose IV injection.
Dobutamine stress&#8594; pharmacologic stress
&#946;1-receptor agonist&#8594; &#8593; myocardial oxygen demand
Usually reserved for when adenosine is contraindicated&#8594; severe asthma, COPD, or recent caffeine.

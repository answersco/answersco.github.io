Factors Affecting Spatial Resolution
FOV: smaller FOV&#8594; better resolution
Focal spot size: usually not an issue unless you get the anatomy away from the image receptor
Image Receptor: limited by detector elements in FPD, TV for II
Motion and temporal factors&#8594; motion creates ghosting
Dynamic range: only an issue for II systems&#8594; variability in very dense or very transparent objects
Pixel binning: binning increases pixel size&#8594; reduced spatial resolution (but improved SNR)
Frame averaging: increases SNR, but more susceptible to blur
Pulsed fluoro: less motion artifact (better spatial resolution in moving objects) and overall less dose

Focal spot size:
Smaller focal spot&#8594; less blur, better spatial resolution

Magnification: 
&#8593; magnification blurs the image &#8594; &#8595; spatial resolution

Detector aperture size:
As detector size is &#8595;, the craniocaudal resolution &#8593;
In-plane (&quot;x-y axis&quot;) resolution is not affected by aperture size

Projections: 
More projections = more data = better resolution

Reconstruction slice thickness:
The thinner the detector element aperture&#8594; better the spatial resolution in the Z-direction

Pixel size and display FOV:
Display FOV is always &lt; the scan FOV
Pixel size = DFOV / matrix size
&#8595; DFOV and &#8593; matrix size &#8594; smaller pixels&#8594; better spatial resolution

Pitch:
As pitch &#8593;, the width of the slice sensitivity profile (SSP) also &#8593;
As SSP widens, slice thickness &#8593; &#8594; &#8595; spatial resolution

Motion &#8594; blurring &#8594; &#8595; image resolution

Focal spot size:
Smaller focal spot&#8594; less blur, better spatial resolution, object details spread out over less detectors

Magnification: 
&#8593; magnification blurs the image &#8594; &#8595; spatial resolution

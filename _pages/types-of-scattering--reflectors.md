title: "Types of scattering (reflectors)"

Specular (smooth): strength of reflection is highly dependent on the angle of incidence.
-Relatively independent of frequency

Non-specular (diffuse): angle has no effect on strength

High frequency = small wavelength = surfaces appear more rough = more scatter
-Absorption also increases with frequency

Hyperechoic = high scatter amplitude relative to average background
Hypoechoic = low scatter amplitude relative to background

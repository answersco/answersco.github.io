title: "Basic construct of a guidwire"
---
Most commonly used type of guidewire:
-Central stiff core around which is wrapped a smaller wire, like a coiled spring.
-The outer wire is welded to the core at the back end, but not the tip.
-Coiled wrap: decreases area of contact between the surface of the guidewire and the tissues
-Between the inner core wire and the outer wrap is a fine safety wire that runs along the length of the guidewire and is welded to the outer wrap at both ends. This safety wire prevents the wrap from unwinding.

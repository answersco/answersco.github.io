&quot;Liver scan sign&quot; = lack of visualization of the biliary tree, which can be seen with acute CBD obstruction

No bowel activity, persistent blood pool = hepatocyte dysfunction (hepatitis)

No bowel activity, blood pool clears normally = CBD obstruction

No GB activity x 4 hours (or 1 hour + morphine ) = acute chole

Abnormal GB emptying (EF &lt; 30%) = chronic cholecystitis

title: "What are the three pathways of lymphatic drainage from the breast?"
---
75% is to the axillary lymph nodes
25% of lymphatic drainage is to the ipsilateral internal mammary chain nodes
A small amount may drain to the contralateral breast/skin/internal mammary nodes by anastomotic lymphatic pathways.

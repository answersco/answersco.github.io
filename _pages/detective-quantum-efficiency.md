DQE
Essentially an estimate of the required exposure level that will be needed to create an optimal image
This is a measure of EFFICIENCY
Better the DQE, lower the dose needed 
DQE decreases as the demand for spatial resolution increases 

DR systems have a higher DQE because they have a near perfect fill factor

title: "Agreement measures"
---
To evaluate categorical data, measures of agreement are used
Observer agreement: can provide information about the reliability of imaging-based diagnoses, consistency of a method for classifying extend of disease, and value of an imaging technique when an independent reference standard proof of diagnosis is difficult to obtain.
k is a measure of agreement that is corrected for chance
K of 0: means that there is no agreement beyond that expected by chance
K of 1: means that there is perfect agreement
Agreement (k) is affected by prevalence
Agreement is not a surrogate for accuracy&#8594; high accuracy implies high agreement, but high agreement does not necessarily imply high accuracy.

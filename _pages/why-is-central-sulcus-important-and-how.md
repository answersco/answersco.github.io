title: "Why is central sulcus important and how to find?"
---
Separates frontal from parietal lobes - motor from sensory!):

To find the CENTRAL SULCUS:
- find the pars bracket sign (pars marginalis), which is IMMEDIATELY behind the central sulcus
- Find the omega sign, which corresponds to the precentral gyrus (motor hand area) - therefore the central SULCUS is just posterior to this
- the post central gyrus is usually a bit thinner than the precentral one
- Also, the intraparietal sulcus intersects the POST CENTRAL SUCLUS almost always

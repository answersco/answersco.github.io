title: "Why is the activity of the daughter slightly higher than the activity of the parent in transient equilibrium?"
---
At the moment that the activities are equal, we know that the number of disintegrations/per second of the parent and child will be the same, and so transiently, the child will experience no net loss of activity. As the activity of the parent drops, it is unable to sustain the child, and so the child activity immediately begins to fall as well, with the surplus falling more quickly because of the shorter half-life of the daughter until they are both falling at the same rate dictated by the half-life of the parent.

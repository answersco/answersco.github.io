title: "Monitoring dose"

1. Time- least worthwhile
2. DAP/KAP: ionization chamber in tube (mGy/sec) x collimation area. Doesn't take into account if dose is spread or one area of skin. Dose stays same w change of distance bc FOV also changes
3. IRP: Interventional reference point - ionization measured at ref point

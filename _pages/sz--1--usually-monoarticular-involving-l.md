title: "Sz: 1) usually monoarticular involving large joints,(MC hip, shoulder, ankle, elbow, knee) 2) indistinct cortex (white line should surround bone on each side of joint, need to explain any discontinuity) 3) widened joint distance 4) blurred tissue planes 5) CT/MR: abscess 6) US: distension of joint capsule 7) MR (may be most sensitive/specific) signal change &gt; favor infection 8) negative XR does not exclude  HIP 1) XR: wide teardrop distance vs contralateral (&gt; 2mm=effusion) 2) XR: displacement of gluteus maximus, obturator internus or iliopsoas fat pads 3) US: fluid displacing the capsule anteriorly  SHOULDER: 1) lateral displacement of the humerus (compare distances from glenoid labra to proximal metaphasis of humerus, difference &gt;2mm=effusion 2) US: more sensative for effusion Mech: 1) young infant: metaphysis to epiphysis &amp; joint space, 2) child: physis acts as protective barrier from metaphyseal spread, may occur by: a) direct spread from an adjacent osteomyelitis, b) sepsis w/ hematogenous seeding c) direct seeding via trauma Cz: MC Staph &amp; Strep, H.Flu previously Sx: limp Comp: lytic enzymes destroy cartilage &amp; can infarct bone Tx: 1) any joint effusion MUST be emergently aspirated to r/o septic joint b/c can destroy hip 2) tap the joint (can do this with US guidance) so that appropriate Abx can be started. OSTEOMYELITIS: hip, shoulder, elbow, ankle joints extend to metaphysis; knee has no intra-articular metaphysis"

title: "What dictates spread of odontogenic infection?"
---
Odontogenic infection: more commonly from extracted tooth than intact tooth
Attachment of mylohyoid muscle to mylohyoid ridge dictates spread of infection
Above mylohyoid line (anterior mandibular teeth) &#8594; spread to sublingual space
Below mylohyoid line (2nd and 3rd molars) &#8594; goes to submandibular space
Odontogenic abscess is most common mandibular space mass in adult

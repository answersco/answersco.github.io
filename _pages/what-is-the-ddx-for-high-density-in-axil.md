title: "What is the ddx for high density in axillary lymph nodes?"
---
Punctate and amorphous high density foci within the node are typically associated with gold therapy and ipsilateral arm/chest tattoos.

Pleomorphic microcalcs within enlarged nodes are associated with metastatic disease

Coarser calcifications are more suggestive of chronic granulomatous infection.

In a patient with evidence of breast silicone, large high density nodes are dx of silicone.

title: "How to tell difference between a Jones fracture and avulsion fracture of base of 5th metatarsal?"
---
The Avulsion fracture will extend into the proximal TMT joint, while the Jones will extend into the inter metatarsal joint (which is more distal than the TMT)

Avulsion fracture responds well WITHOUT surgery

Stress fracture (most distal) IS HARD TO HEAL

title: "What is the surgical classification of aortic dissections?"
---
Dissections that include the ascending aorta and aortic arch proximal to the origin of the left subclavian artery (DeBakey 1 and 2, Stanford A) require surgical treatment. Dissections involving the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery (DeBakey 3, Stanford B) can be treated medically with stringent blood pressure control.

title: "Treatment options if a bleeding vessel cannot be reached with a catheter"

-Embolization across the origin of a bleeding branch with coils is usually effective as long as no other collateral is present.
-Embolization with a small volume of glue (NBCA) is very effective because flow directs the material to the site of bleeding.

-If superselective position with a coaxial microcatheter cannot be achieved or operative therapy is indicated, the catheter can be left in place and methylene blue injected at the time of resection to outline the segment of bowel responsible for the bleeding.
-Can also leave a coil as close as possible to the bleeding site.

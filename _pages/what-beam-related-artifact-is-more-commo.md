Side-lobe artifact &#8594; More common with linear array transducers
Side-lobes are created from radial expansion of the piezoelectric crystals&#8594; creates off-axis low-energy beams on the side
Received echoes are incorrectly attributed to the main beam, and incorrectly placed.
Example: incorrectly placed echoes overlap an anechoic structure (bladder, gallbladder)

Pleura: Parietal pleural plaques. Pleural effusion. Localized visceral pleural fibrosis. Diffuse pleural fibrosis. Mesothelioma. Lung parenchyma: Interlobular septal thickening. Interstitial fibrosis (asbestosis). Rounded atelectasis. Bronchogenic carcinoma. Lower lung predominance.

Asbestosis: lung disease caused by inhalation of asbestos fibers
Unlike the other inhalational lung diseases, asbestosis predominantly affects the lower lobes, because the asbestos particles are too large to be removed by the alveolar macrophages and lymphatic system.
End-stage asbestosis can lead to pulmonary fibrosis with a UIP pathology.
Radiographic/CT appearance and distribution of advanced asbestosis may be indistinguishable from IPF
Important clue in asbestosis is evidence of asbestos exposure, such as pleural thickening and plaques.
Pleural plaques (+/- calcification): due to asbestos exposure, but not a component of asbestosis, do not lead to fibrosis, and are asymptomatic.

This looks very similar to UIP 
The MAJOR difference is PARIETAL PLEURAL THICKENING

(Image has pleural plaque as well as fibrosis)

*<b>NOTE</b>* Benign pleural effusions is the EARLIEST FINDING but is still associated with a lag time of 5 years

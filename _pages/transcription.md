title: "Transcription"
---
effected by chromatin remodeling and alternate splicing

-production of RNA that is complementary to DNA
-RNA is synthesized from one strand of the DNA double helix called the template strand
-happens in nucleus
-occurs in three steps (initiation, elongation, and termination)
-complementary strand is identical to mRNA with the exception of Uracil for Thymidine

DNA --&gt; RNA

-takes place in nucleus
-RNA polymerase attaches to promoter region to create RNA sequence by finding which DNA strand is oriented 3'-5'
-coding strand (3'-5') is made from template strand (5'-3')

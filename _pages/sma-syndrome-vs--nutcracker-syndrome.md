title: "SMA syndrome vs. nutcracker syndrome:"
---
SMA syndrome (AKA Wilkie syndrome): compression of duodenum between the aorta and SMA.
Occurs in thin children, burn victims, and patients who have lost a lot of weight.
Nutcracker syndrome: compression of the left renal vein between the aorta and SMA
Posterior nutcracker: compression of a retroaortic (or circumaortic) renal vein between the aorta and vertebral body.
Symptoms include pain, hematuria, orthostatic proteinuria, pelvic congestion.
Treatment: depends on symptoms.
Majority of cases with hematuria resolve within 2 years of observation.
Angioplasty and stenting of the renal vein can be performed if needed.
Imaging in the pelvis shows dilated veins, identical to pelvic findings in pelvic congestion syndrome.
Venography: shows compression of the LRV, perirenal varices, retrograde filling of a dilated left gonadal vein (&gt; 5 mm), and elevated pressure gradient between the renal vein and IVC (&gt; 2 mmHg).

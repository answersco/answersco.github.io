title: "Where is the rotator cuff interval and its loss of fat is seen in which disease?"
---
The rotator interval is a triangular region that allows rotation around the coracoid process - it's where the biceps tendon is between the supraspinatus and subscapularis.
- Contains the coracohumeral ligament (CHL), the long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT), and the superior glenohumeral ligament (SGHL)

- Adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder)
- might see enhancement of the rotator cuff interval on MR

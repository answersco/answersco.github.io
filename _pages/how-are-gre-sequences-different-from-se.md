title: "How are GRE sequences different from SE?"

GRE uses flip angle &lt; 90 and does NOT have a 180 degree pulse.
Advantage to low flip angle is faster recovery, shorter TR/TE times, and faster scan.
Because you aren't using a 180 degree pulse, you are dealing with T2* and not T2- these are therefore more susceptible to susceptibility artifacts.
GRE has lower specific absorption rate (less heating)

2 main methods for dealing with residual transverse magnetization in GRE
-Spoiled (incoherent) GRE: uses gradients and/or RF pulses = basically T1
-Refocused (coherent) GRE: uses rewind gradient (e.g. SSFP). Basically T2 or T2*.

Radiotracer: Tc-99m labeled RBCs &#8594; prepared in vitro by mixing 1-3 mL of anticoagulated blood with stannous chloride and an oxidizing agent.
Takes &gt; 20 minutes for radiolabeling process
In-vivo technique&#8594; provides much noisier images due to worse labeling efficiency and resultant free pertechnetate&#8594; rarely performed
Tc-99m sulfur colloid as an alternative
Rapid blood clearance and vascular half-life of 2-3 minutes
Bleeding rates as low as 0.2 mL/min can be detected with a tagged RBC study versus 1 mL/min for angiography

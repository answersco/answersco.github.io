title: "Treaty of Versailles (1919)"
---
Treaty that ended World War I; it was much harder on Germany than Wilson wanted but not as punitive as France and England desired. It established Germany's guilt in starting the war and demanded severe reparations and demilitarization; it was harsh enough, however, to set stage for Hitler's rise of power in Germany in 1930s.

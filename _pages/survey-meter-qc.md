title: "Survey meter QC:"
---
For routine QC on a daily basis&#8594; the zero-level of the survey meter must be verified in an area with a very low background rate, and then the constancy of the survey meter must be tested with a long-lived radioactive &quot;check source.&quot;
The inter-day constancy measurement must be within + 5% &#8594; otherwise the survey meter may need to be recalibrated.
May not use survey instruments in the difference between the indicated exposure rate and the calculated exposure rate is &gt; 20%

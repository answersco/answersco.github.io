title: "Clinical findings and management of surgical graft stenosis"
---
Decrease in ABI of 0.15-2 or identification of a new HD significant stenosis at any point in the graft should prompt further imaging.

Focal stenoses are usually treated with angioplasty. 
-These are fibrotic lesions and may require a cutting or scoring balloon.

Long-segment stenoses are best managed with graft revision or insertion of a jump graft around the stenotic area.

If thrombolysis is performed for acutely thrombosed graft, angio should be performed after to evaluate for underlying stenosis
-When graft crosses knee joint and no stenosis is found after thrombolysis, flexion and stress views should be obtained to exclude kinking or external compression.

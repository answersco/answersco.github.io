title: "Grid lines"
---
MM always uses a grid, except in mag views.
Grid lines seen in 3 scenarios:
1. Patient moved.
2. Exposure was too long.
3. Exposure was too short.

you are almost always going to use a grid in mammo UNLESS it is a magnification view

This is when the grid stops moving back and forth

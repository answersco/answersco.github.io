title: "Sizing of catheters and sheaths:"
---
Catheters:
Sizing: catheters are sized in French (Fr), where 1 Fr = 0.33 mm
A 6 Fr catheter has an external diameter of 2 mm; the luminal diameter will be slightly smaller.
Sheath:
Sheath: has a defined luminal diameter; however, the overall diameter of the catheter will be slightly larger.
Example: 6 Fr sheath can by definition fit a 6 Fr catheter inside, but will be 7 or 8 Fr in external diameter.

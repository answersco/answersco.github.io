title: "Lateral dispersion of light"

This is a process by which you lose spatial resolution
Basically as with anything in radiology, you want all of your signals to be SPATIALLY in line with where they originated from
Unfortunately when light is generated from a CsI (Cesium Iodide) scintillator, it fans out slightly before hitting the PHOTODIODE
Note: this is something that happens with INDIRECT systems for capturing images
Note: This gets WORSE as the thickness of the crystal increases

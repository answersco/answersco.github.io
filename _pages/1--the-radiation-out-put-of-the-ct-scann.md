title: "1. The radiation out-put of the CT scanner  3. mGy  4. Based on 32 and 16 cm phantoms  5. CTDI is the dose for one slice ----------------------- 1. CTDI (vol): total radiation output from the scanner for an exam  3. Multiply the dose for the one slice x the number of slices for the study  4. CTDI vol = (kvp new / kvp old)^2  6. CTDI vol is proportional to the square of the percent change in kvp and is directly proportional to the mAs  7. For the same CTDI vol -&gt;  -Larger patients receive a smaller dose  -Smaller patientS receive a higher dose ---------------------------  1. CTDI (weight)  2. Takes into account the uneven distribution of radiation in the abdomen  3. CTDI (weight) = 1/3 peripheral dose + 2/3 central dose????  ------------------------"

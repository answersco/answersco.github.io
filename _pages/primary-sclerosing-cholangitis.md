title: "Primary sclerosing cholangitis"
---
-inflammation of intra and extrahepatic ducts
-&quot;central regenerative hypertrophy&quot;
-assoc with UC
-increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma, cirrhosis
Rx: transplant

Ideopathic (associated with inflammatory bowel disease 80% UC 20% Crohns)
Strongly associated with cholangiocarcinoma
Buzzword for cirrhotic pattern is CENTRAL regenerative hypertrophy 
Dilated intrahepatic bile ducts are very rare in cirrhosis except when you have PSC 

MRCP findings:
1. Withered tree appearance 
2. Beaded appearance: strictures + focal dilations 

NOTE:

AIDS cholangiopathy: this is a mimic of PSC in patients with AIDS \
The classic finding is PAPILLARY STENOSIS (this is the portion of the intrapancreatic bile duct) - see image for papillary stenosis

-inflammation of BOTH intra and extrahepatic ducts which are saccular and small &lt;5mm
-&quot;central regenerative hypertrophy&quot;
-assoc with UC
-increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma, cirrhosis
Rx: transplant

really the only type of cirrhosis that has dilated intrahepatic bile ducts

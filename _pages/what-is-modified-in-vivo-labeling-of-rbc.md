title: "What is modified in vivo labeling of RBCs with pertechnetate?"
---
First you inject stannous pyrophosphate into the blood stream IV, then wait 30 minutes and withdraw 5-10 cc into a tube, then add pertechnetate (modified because part of the Labeling occurs in vivo and the other in vitro)

In Vitro obviously has the best labeling efficiency (because you can control it in the glass tube)

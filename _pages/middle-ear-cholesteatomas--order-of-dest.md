title: "Middle ear cholesteatomas: order of destruction, and 2 different types"
---
Cholesteatoma order of destruction:
1. Scutum
2. Ossicles (long process of incus).
3. Lateral segment of the semi-circular canal

Pars Flaccida Type: typically acquired (more common overall). Grow into Prussak's space.
-Scutum eroded early- specific sign of acquired cholesteatoma.
-Malleus head displaced medially.
-Long process of incus is most commonly eroded segment of the ossicular chain.
-Fistula to semi-circular canal most commonly involves lateral segment.

Pars Tensa Type: inner ear structures involved earlier and more commonly.
-Overall less common than Pars Flaccida.

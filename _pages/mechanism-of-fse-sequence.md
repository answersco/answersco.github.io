title: "Mechanism of FSE sequence"

FSE: idea is to reduce the TR, which is a major contributor to the duration of the study
-Done by applying multiple 180 degree RF pulses, each resulting in an echo
-Echo train length = # of echoes in same TR
-Normal phenomenon called J coupling, which occurs between nuclei of lipid molecules, causes intrinsic shortening of T2 signal. The fast repetition of 180 degree pulses messes up the J couples and causes T2 of fat to lengthen. Thus T2 fat signal is longer with FSE.
-T2 blurring: with each progressive echo train the transverse signal gradually decreases.
-Acquisition time: proportional to 1/ETL

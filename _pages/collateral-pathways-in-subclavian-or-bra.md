title: "Collateral pathways in subclavian or brachiocephalic stenosis"
---
Subclavian artery origin stenosis/occlusion: potential collateral routes include all branches of the subclavian and axillary arteries
-Subclavian steal: retrograde flow in ipsilateral vertebral artery
-In patients with prior CABG with LIMA, proximal stenosis of subclavian can cause steal phenomenon involving internal mammary that presents as angina.

Proximal occlusion of innominate artery: can result in retrograde flow down the right CCA or vertebral artery.
-May have reversal of flow in smaller subclavian artery branches (e.g. thyrocervical trunk).

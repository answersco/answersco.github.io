title: "Management of clogged or dislodged G-tube"
---
Clogged tube: 
-Can be opened with either high-pressure syringes, heated water, or carbonated beverages.
-If tube remains clogged, passing a guidewire down the tube may open it up

Dislodged tube:
-Important to have patient return to IR immediately, as the tract will often close over 24-48 hours depending on its maturity.
-Usually possible to regain access using a combination of a Kumpe catheter and hydrophilic wire.

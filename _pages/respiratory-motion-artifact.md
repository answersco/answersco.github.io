title: "Respiratory motion artifact"

Phase encoding direction
Fixes:
- breath holding
- respiratory gating
- ROPE (respiratory ordered phase encoding) - phase encoding steps occur with respiration
- breathing navigator - echo determines position -&gt; timing and acquisition based on echo
- saturation band across abdomen
- switch phase encoding direction
- PROPELLOR sequence

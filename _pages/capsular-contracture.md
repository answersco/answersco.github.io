Look for a rounding of the contractured implant
It will get worse with time

It occurs
secondary to contraction of the fibrous capsule, and can result in a terrible cosmetic

subglandular silicone implants. On mammo it looks like rounding or distortion of the
implant (comparisons will show progression).

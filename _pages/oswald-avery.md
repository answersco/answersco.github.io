-treated lysed S bacteria with enzymes: protease and DNase
-protease: broke down proteins
-DNase: broke down DNA
-if we destroyed the proteins, you would still have the living virus in the DNA but the one that destroyed the DNA then the mouse would live
-not the protein carrying the capability to create the capsule but it was in the DNA
-DNase prevented transformation
-therefore DNA is the transforming principle

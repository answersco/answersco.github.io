title: "Increased ventilation"
---
&#8595; CO2 Hypocapnea &#8594; respiratory alkalosis

-Decreased carbon dioxide

-Increased neuromuscular irritability, cardiac arrhythmias

-Common with hyperventilation- may cause dizziness, then pass out

-Acute asthma attack (initially resp. alkalosis, then hypercapnia bc you cant keep breathing that fast that long) then eventually will go the other way into resp. acidosis 

**Carbon dioxide removed with air movement
**As respiratory rate and depth change - carbon dioxide levels change

title: "G-protein cAMP mechanism"
---
1) Hormone-receptor binding activates a G-protein
2) G-protein activiates adenylate cyclase
3) Adenylate cyclase produces cAMP
4) cAMP activates protein kinase
5) Protein kinases phosphorylate enzymes. This activates some enzymes and deactivates others
6) Activated enzymes catalyze metabolic reactions with a wide range of possible effects on the cell

Fibrous dysplasia:
Buzzwords: &quot;ground-glass,&quot; &quot;long lesion in long bone,&quot; &quot;lytic lesion with hazy matrix,&quot; &quot;no periosteal reaction or pain.&quot;
Likes ribs, long bones, skull, face (Lion-like)
In pelvis, it also hits ipsilateral femur (Shepherd Crook Deformity)

Syndromes with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia:
McCune Albright: girl, cafe au lait spots, precocious puberty
Mazabraud: woman (middle-age), soft-tissue myxomas, &#8593; risk of malignant transformation

Adamantinoma: tibial lesion that resembles fibrous dysplasia (mixed lytic and sclerotic). Potentially malignant

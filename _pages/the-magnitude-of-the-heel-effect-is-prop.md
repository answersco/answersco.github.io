title: "The magnitude of the heel effect is proportional to what (directly and inversely), and how can you reduce it?"
---
Magnitude of heel effect is directly proportional to field size
It is inversely proportional to the anode angle and the source-to-image detector distance
Thus, to &#8595; the heel effect, you can &#8593; the anode angle, &#8593; the source-to-detector distance, or &#8595; the field size.

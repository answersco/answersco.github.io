Ideally patient should be studied on tilting table in reverse Trendelenburg.
L ovarian vein is more commonly affected and easier to catheterize, so it's addressed first.

L renal venogram should be obtained to demonstrate reflux into the ovarian vein.
Injection into an abnormal ovarian vein (normal diameter 5 mm) reveals retrograde flow into the pelvis and filling of the uterine plexus of veins, with drainage through the hypogastric veins or through a contralateral normal ovarian vein.
Similarly, injections into the internal iliac veins may identify reflux into the pelvic veins.

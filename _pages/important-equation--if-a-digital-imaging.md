title: "IMPORTANT EQUATION: If a digital imaging system contains 100 samples per horizontal row that is 100 mm long, what is the limiting spatial resolution?"

Calculate the sampling frequency (samples/mm)!

100 samples/100 mm = 1 sample/ mm

The limiting spatial resolution is 1/2 * sampling frequency (need a black and a white line), therefore, it'd be 0.5 lp/mm in this case!

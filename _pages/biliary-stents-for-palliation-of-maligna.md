title: "Biliary stents for palliation of malignant obstruction: site selection"
---
Principle of palliation : drain as much of functioning liver as possible.
-Optimal palliation for hilar malignancies (usually Klatskin tumor) is achieved when both sites are stented.
-Anomalous drainage of RPD into the LHD: draining the left lobe alone may be sufficeint. 
-Separate occlusion of the RAD and RPD (stage 3a): draining the right side is of little benefit. Draining the left side alone if it is of adequate size may be beneficial.

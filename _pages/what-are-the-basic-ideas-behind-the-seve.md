-Cognitive psychology is the study of learning, memory, language, and problem solving, and includes the field of cognitive neuroscience.

-Biopsychology emerged as the study of the biological bases of behavior,such as hormones, heredity, chemicals in the nervous system, structural defects in the brain, and the effects of physical diseases.

-The principles of evolution and the knowledge we currently have about evolution are used in this perspective to look at the way the mind works and why it works as it does. Behavior is seen as having an adaptive or survival value.

title: "&quot;An echo from 10 cm has to travel 20 cm to get back to transducer. Uncorrected echo data thus would show distant echoes as being much weaker than superficial echoes. Ultrasound scanners compensate for increased attenuation with image depth. Increase the signal gain as the echo return time increases"

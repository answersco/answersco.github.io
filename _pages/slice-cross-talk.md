title: "Slice cross-talk"
---
Selective RF pulses&#8594; yield imperfect slice profiles, whose edges aren't straight and extend beyond the nominal slice thickness.
With multi-slice technique and with contiguous slices, a selective RF pulse can thus partially excite the adjacent slices.
Likewise, if several interlacing slice stacks cross, the zone of intersection will be partially excited.
This &quot;cross-talk&quot; &#8594; will cause a modification in slice signal and/or a loss of signal through partial saturation in the slice or zone of intersection.
Slice-select gradient&#8594; determines slice thickness (&#8593; gradient&#8594; thinner slices), but does not produce slice cross-talk.

title: "How does fMRI work?"
---
Functional MRI (fMRI) is most commonly performed as BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) fMRI. As neuronal activation occurs, blood flow is increased to the activated area with a brief delay of a few seconds. Increase in blood flow overcompensates the increased oxygen requirements and the ratio of deoxyhemoglobin to oxyhemoglobin actually decreases in areas of activation. Deoxyhemoglobin is paramagnetic and has lower signal on T2<b> weighted sequences than oxyhemoglobin. Thus, neuronal activation results in slightly increased T2</b> signal. Signal difference between activated and nonactivated areas is so small that many repeated acquisitions are performed in rest and activation to make this subtle difference measurable.

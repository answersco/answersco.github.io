title: "Carotid artery assessment"
---
1) visualize the carotid artery 
-avoid palpating both sides simultaneously to prevent a decrease in cerebral blood flow
-avoid excessive manipulation of the carotid sheath &#8594; a &#8595; HR and syncope
2) absent pulse wave may indicate
-occlusion of the vessel by a clot
-stenosis 
3) auscultate for a bruit (carotid stenosis): ask pt to hold breath for second and auscultate carotid to hear for any turbulent blood flow(indicates a narrowing)
-normally absent
-if present, palpate for a thrill (purring)

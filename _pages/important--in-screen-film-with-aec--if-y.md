title: "IMPORTANT: In screen film with AEC, if you increase screen thickness, what happens to quantum mottle?"

It's UNCHANGED

Quantum mottle depends on number of photons detected by detector. Thus, thicker screens improve XR absorption efficiency --&gt; more photons detected, but as a result, require shorter exposure times when AEC is on (decrease the number of photons detected). Therefore, they cancel out and net effect is no change in quantum mottle.

If AEC was OFF, then presumably thicker screen means less quantum mottle

title: "Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum:"
---
Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum&#8594; appears identical to Ebstein anomaly on XR with massive RA enlargement and &#8595; pulmonary blood flow.
Because the lack of VSD markedly &#8595; blood flow to the lungs, pulmonary blood flow depends on a left to right shunt, such as PDA
Pulmonary atresia with a VSD is in spectrum of Tetralogy of Fallot, and usually has normal-sized heart.

title: "HLA diversity"
---
-genes with multiple alleles determine an HLA type (self vs non-self)
-genetic diversity at HLA genes is large
-one in 10,000 unrelated people will share an HLA type by chance at the six major HLA genes
-matching at least four major HLA genes is needed for most transplants to succeed
-HLA genes account for about 50% of the genetic impact on immunity

title: "Describe the air bronchogram sign"

This occurs when there is consolidation surrounding the small airways. The alveoli become filled with pus, blood, or fluid, resulting in the air filled bronchi standing out against a background of consolidated alveolar air spaces. It is a classic indication of a pulmonary process, rather than a mediastinal or pleural process. Thus the sign can be present in pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or pulmonary infarction.

title: "Most common tracers in myocardial perfusion/SPECT"
---
Tc-sestamibi and Tc-tetrofosmin
-Both cross cell membrane and localize in mitochondria via passive diffusion
-Don't redistribute (unlike thallium)- better flexibility
-Tetrofosmin cleared from liver more rapidly than sestamibi, decreasing chance of hepatic uptake artifact.
-Imaging done 30-90 minutes after injection to allow clearance from background.

Thallium: more of historical significance for cardiac
Mimics potassium, crossing cell membrane first by distribution related to blood flow, second by delayed redistribution (washout). 
-Washout delayed in areas with poor perfusion.
-Lung/heart ratio (only thallium): more in lungs correlates with multivessel disease or high grade LAD/LCX lesions

title: "Normalization scan vs blank scan in PET"
---
PET QA tests

Normalization scan: corrects for discrepancies in the thousands of detector elements
-Scan a calibrated position source placed in the FOV
-Scan serves to normalize the detection lines
-Should be done monthly (N-M = normal month)

Blank scan: done to help keep the AC data accurate
-Done with nothing in the FOV
-Essentially zeroing the scanner
-Done daily (start each day with blank slate)

&quot;Just culture&quot; model: proposed to reconcile the twin needs for no-blame and appropriate accountability
The focus is on identifying and addressing systems issues that lead individuals to engage in unsafe behaviors while maintaining individual accountability by establishing zero tolerance for reckless behavior.
Distinguishes between human error (e.g. slips), at-risk behavior (e.g. taking shortcuts), and reckless behavior (e.g. ignoring required safety steps).
In a just culture, the response to an error or near-miss is predicated on the type of behavior associated with the error, not the severity of the event.

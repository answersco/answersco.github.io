Veins to be removed first marked with indelible ink
-Generous injection of local anesthetic in SC tissues around veins.
-Small incision made adjacent to the marked veins along natural fold lines.
-Vein hook inserted through the incision, and using a combination of sweeping and probing maneuvers, the vein is engaged and withdrawn through the incision.
-Hemostats placed on each side of loop, and vein is divided between the hemostats. Each end of the vein is gently pulled until it breaks or the operator makes a new incision along vein at adjacent location and starts procedure over again.
-Hemostasis achieved with pressure, or, for larger veins, ligation with absorbable suture of the residual vein stumps.

title: "Fluoro in IR: focal spot, kVp, filter, grid"
---
Focal spot: small focal spot + large # of x-rays
Anode angle usually smaller than that with conventional XR, but heel effect remains zero due to small FOV and small image detector
Focal spots can be exchanged (large, small, micro) depending on need for resolution

kVp: best kVp to use with contrast is between 60 and 80 kVp (average beams hit the k-edge nicely)
Higher kVp loses iodine contrast

Equalization filter or soft filter: reduce intensity to taper the radiation profile
Often used when imaging the leg, arm, or peds patients.

Grids: NOT USED IN EXTREMITIES OR PEDS

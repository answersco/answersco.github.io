title: "Mistake vs slip?"
---
Has to do with intention
- Mistake = occurs during active problem solving (chose to turn right, but should've turned left)
- in a just culture, you get retrained

- Slip = occurs during automatic cognitive task (you choose to turn right, but you turn left instead)
- in a just culture, you get consoled
- SLIPS cannot be prevented with additional training but can be prevented with &quot;forcing functions&quot;

-when injury happens to the coronary muscle, this is released which causes the pain 
-first place it gets to where it interacts with pain receptors is where you get the feelings of having pain (when people have MI's can be up your neck, in your shoulder, down your arm, in your back bc its wherever the substance P interacts with a pain receptor)

title: "Beam intensity/characteristics"
---
combination of mA, kVp, area exposed, time of exposure
Technical description is the NUMBER of xrays MULTIPLIED by the energy of the xrays

Important notes:
1. the AVERAGE energy of the xray spectrum determines the CONTRAST (must be a change in KvP) because remember we are trying to get the beam characteristics to be close to the K-edge
2. Visualization of LOW CONTRAST objects/tissue can be ENHANCED with increasing the mAs (essentially the equivalent of giving you MORE SIGNAL in MRI terms). Remember, in this case, if we have optimized are KvP, then we cant change the KvP or we are going to ruin the subtle contrast difference that we have achieved.

Important examples:
1. Lets say you want to LOWER SKIN DOSE but keep CONSTANT exposure: Increase the KvP by 15% (this means there are going to be fewer photoelectric effects and more of the electrons are going to blast straight through the body and never interact with tissue) THEN 1/2 the mAs.

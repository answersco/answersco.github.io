title: "Hydranencephaly"
---
infarct/infection leading to cortical destruction. in utero MCA infarct. will not see cortical mantle (vs. hydrocephalus). will still have fax (vs holoprosencephaly)

Ischemic infarction of both cerebral hemispheres. Early compromise of both carotid arteries with preservation of posterior circulation. Mimics severe hydrocephalus (thin rind of cortical gray matter). Complete infarction of supratentorial cerebral tissues with preservation of thalami and cerebellum.

Destruction of the cerebral hemispheres, which are replaced by CSF
Thought to be secondary to vascular insult in utero (think double MCA infarct).
Could be seen in setting of TORCH with necrotizing vasculitis (may occur with HSV)

Previously had normal brain, so you have a falx, but the cortical mantle is gone.

Massive in-utero insult
You WILL have a falx, but you will NOT have any brain tissue
NO cortical mantle

-destruction of cerebral hemispheres
-vascular insult in utero
-HSV

-destruction of cerebral hemispheres
-vascular insult in utero
-HSV
-Falx is present (vs holoprosencephaly or anencephaly)

In tact falx, absent cerebrum

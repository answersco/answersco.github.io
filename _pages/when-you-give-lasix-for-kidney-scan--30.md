title: "When you give lasix for kidney scan (30 min after clearance), then what is considered normal vs indeterminate vs obstructed?"
---
Normal = tracer clears without need for lasix of 50% out within 10 minutes of lasix

Indeterminate = 50% out within 10-20 minutes (could be due to reservoir effect from very dilated pelvis)

Obstructed = 50% out takes &gt; 20 minutes

False Positive if poor response to lasix initially (bad renal function or dehydration - use MAG3 instead of DTPA); full or neurogenic bladder creating back pressure, and reservoir effect

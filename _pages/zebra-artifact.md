Zebra Artifact: also a reformat artifact
Can occur from helical data secondary to the helical interpolation process (increases noise along the Z-axis)
Effect manifests as stripes (like a zebra) most pronounced on a 3D image
Effect is most significant away from the axis of rotation (noise is worst off-axis).

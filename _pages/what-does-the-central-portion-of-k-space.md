title: "What does the central portion of k-space encode?"
---
The central portion k-space contains the lower spatial frequencies which contain the information about the image CONTRAST (what is bright and what is dark and thus encodes for image weighting: T1, T2, etc.

The periphery of k-space contains the higher spatial frequencies which contain information about the detail of the image (borders of structures, resolution).

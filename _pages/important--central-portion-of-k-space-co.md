title: "IMPORTANT: Central portion of k-space contains what spatial frequencies?"
---
Center = low spatial frequencies (gross form and tissue contrast)
- without this info, the outline of your image is visible but not the signal (i.e. is it bright or dark)

Periphery = high spatial frequencies (detail of the image/spatial resolution/borders of structures)
- without this info, the image is blurred with truncation artifact

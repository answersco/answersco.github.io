title: "Post-operative bleeding after Whipple"
---
These patients may develop a characteristic type of delayed posto-op bleeding from gastroduodenal or pancreatic artery pseudoaneurysms.
Bleeding after 24 hours often presents with &quot;sentinel&quot; or &quot;herald&quot; bleed from a drain and/or the GI tract.

When the origin is the GDA stump, stent-graft placement preserves hepatic arterial flow.
When this is not feasible, coil embo of the hepatic artery across the GDA stump is usually well tolerated if the portal vein is patent.

title: "What artifact worsens with ascites?"
---
Dielectric/Standing wave effects: due to local eddy currents in imaged tissues
-Effects are worse with stronger magnet (because RF waves are shorter at 3T)
-Seen with large bellies and ascites
-Dark signal in central abdomen (usually over left lobe of liver)

Improved by:
-Applying dielectric pads
-Parallel RF transmission (SENSE): gives a longer pulse by sending independent RF pulses from a set of coils.

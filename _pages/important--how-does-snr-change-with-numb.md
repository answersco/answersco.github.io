title: "IMPORTANT: How does SNR change with number of XRs?"
---
Signal is linear (double # XR = double your signal)
 
BUT

Noise decreases by &quot;root n&quot;

Ex) if mA goes from 200 to 400 mA, then SNR = 2/(root 2) = 2/1.4 or 40% increase in SNR

Ex) if mA goes from 200 to 800 mA, then SNR = 4/(root 4) = 4/2 or DOUBLE the SNR 

Summary: You have to quadruple your photons to double your SNR

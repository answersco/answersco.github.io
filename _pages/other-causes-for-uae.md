-Uncontrollable vaginal bleeding due to post-partum uterine atony, OB/GYN surgery, unresectable gyn tumors, or rarely dysfunctional uterine bleeding.
-Post-op arterial bleeding is visualized as extravasation or pseudoaneurysm at angio, while post-partum and tumor bleeding is usually not seen (tumors may even appear relatively avascular).
-Post-partum bleeding from uterine atony or placental abnormalities can be managed with Gelfoam or other particulate embo until there is stasis of the uterine arteries. Uterine arteries may be constricted in setting of extensive resuscitation including oxytocin.
-Localized postop bleeding can be embolized with coils following general embo principles.
-Small permanent particles (e.g. 300-500 um) can be used to devascularize tumors.

Mid-pelvic bleeding sites have potential for shared blood supply, so both IIAs should be evaluated.

title: "What are features differentiating lymphatic malformation from venous malformation?"
---
Phleboliths are diagnostic of venous malformations. Lymphatic tends to have larger T2 bright pockets with septations that enhance. Venous malformations tend to have smaller T2 bright pockets and enhance homogenously. AVMs are high flow and should have flow voids on T2 or high flow on doppler.

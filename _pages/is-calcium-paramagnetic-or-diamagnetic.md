title: "Is calcium paramagnetic or diamagnetic?"
---
Diamagnetic materials, such as water and calcium, have an induced internal field opposing the external field and are weakly repulsed (not noticeable in everyday life). 

In paramagnetic substances such as gadolinium at body temperature and deoxyhemoglobin, the internal field enhances the local magnetic field and they are weakly attracted (not noticeable in everyday life). 

Ferromagnetic substances, such as iron and cobalt, are strongly and noticeably attracted by the magnetic field due to the internal field strongly augmenting the external magnetic field.

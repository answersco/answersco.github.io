title: "Dipyridamole, adenosine, regadenoson, dobutamine. What meds can't be used."
---
Dipyridamole: inhibits breakdown of adenosine (vasodilator)
-No caffeine

Adenosine: vasodilator
-Worse SEs than dipyridamole
-Rare SE is AV block, which improves when adenosine short half-life runs out
-No caffeine 

Regadenoson: selective A2A- fewer SEs
-No caffeine

Dobutamine: beta 1 agonist- increases HR and myocardial contraction.
-Can NOT be on beta blocker
-Best for patients who can't have adenosine/dipyridamole
-Better in patients with COPD/Asthma, or caffeine in last 12 hours.

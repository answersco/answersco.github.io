title: "When does alveolar pulmonary edema occur?"
---
When the LVEDP exceeds 25-30mm Hg. Early is small and nodular opacities. With progressive alveolar filling, air-space consolidation, with dense or poorly defined pulmonary opacities are seen. More often symmetrical, but can be asymmetric or unilateral, especially if there is underlying pulmonary disease and uneven distribution of pulmonary blood flow.

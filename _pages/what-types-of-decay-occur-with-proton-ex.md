title: "What types of decay occur with proton excess?"
---
Proton excess (neutron deficiency): decay by beta-+ decay or electron capture.

Beta-plus: proton transformed into neutron
-Need 1.02 MeV for this to occur.
-Anti-neutrono and positron (beta particle) emitted- travels a short distance before colliding with an electron
-Mutual destruction of positron and electron emits two 5ll keV photons that travel 180 degrees apart.

Electron capture: also seen with proton excess (neutron deficiency)
-Occurs in setting of insufficient energy (beta-+ needs 1.02 MeV)
-Proton captures an electron and turns into a neutron
-The neutron then emits characteristic radiation
-Leads to gamma emission and sometimes characteristic radiation, which can be used in imaging.

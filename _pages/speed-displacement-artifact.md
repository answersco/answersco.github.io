Speed Displacement Artifact: appearance of a discontinuous, focally displaced liver border
The speed of sound slows down in fat, relative to liver &#8594; beam takes longer to return &#8594; perceived as being further away

This is created by the machines assumptions that echoes travel the same speed through all types of tissue
Typically you can see this with fat near an object. The beams that travel through the object and the fat return slower than the other beams
This causes the machine to think that the specific area just described is DEEPER than it actually is

Where is this seen?

Liver with areas of focal fat

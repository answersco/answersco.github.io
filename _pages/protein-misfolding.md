title: "Protein misfolding"
---
-as the protein moves through the tunnel, it is straightened and dismantled
-proteasomes also destroy properly-folded proteins that are in excess or no longer needed
-most are the result of errors in one of the steps of protein synthesis and processing
-in several disorders that affect the brain, the misfolded proteins aggregate
-the protein masses that form clog the proteasomes and inhibit their function
-different proteins are affected in different disorders

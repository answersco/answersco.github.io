title: "Basics and general MRI features of restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)"
---
Restrictive Cardiomyopathy (RCM): commonly leads to diastolic failure
Myocardial wall is too rigid for normal relaxation due to fibrosis or other tissue infiltration
Most common infiltrative causes of RCM: amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, and sarcoidosis.
Clinically difficult to differentiate RCM from constrictive pericarditis

General cardiac MRI features of RCM:
Normal LV size and systolic function
Diastolic dysfunction
Dilation of both atria

1. Methyprednisolone decreases the number of circulating basophils and eosinophils within one hour (max effect reached at 4 hours)

2. Also reduces the amount of histamine within 4 hours (max effect reached by 8 hours)

3. More reactions to steroids are seen when given IV, so oral premedication is preferred.

4. Want at least 6 hours from administration to contrast injection

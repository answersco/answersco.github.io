title: "Imaging appearance of celiac disease:"
---
Celiac disease (sprue, gluten-sensitive enteropathy): primarily involves duodenum and jejunum
Most characteristic finding: reversal of jejunal and ileal fold patterns
Normally, the jejunum has more folds than ileum
Celiac disease: loss of jejunal folds causes compensatory &#8593; in # of ileal folds.
Villous atrophy: causes loss of jejunal folds and hypersecretion of intraluminal fluid &#8594; creates flocculations of barium due to lack of contrast adhesion to bowel wall
Moulage (casting) sign: seen on barium study&#8594; cast-like appearance of the featureless jejunum.
CT: dilated, fluid-filled bowel loops, often with intraluminal flocculations of enteric contrast
Contrast can be seen insinuated between the SB folds, and centrally within the bowel, with a peripheral layer of low-attenuation secretions
Other findings include mesenteric adenopathy and engorged mesenteric vessels
Unlike other causes of enteritis, SB wall thickening and ascites are less common

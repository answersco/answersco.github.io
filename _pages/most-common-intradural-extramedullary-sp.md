Nerve-sheath tumors (schwannoma, neurofibroma)
Most common intradural-extramedullary tumors.
15% are both intradural-extramedullary and extradural (&quot;dumbbell tumors&quot;)
Neurofibroma and schwannoma cannot be reliably distinguished on imaging alone.
Schwannoma is more common, occurs in older patients, and is encapsulated &#8594; can be treated by nerve-sparing approach.
Neurofibroma&#8594; associated with NF1, occurs in younger patients (early adulthood), and lacks a capsule. Requires nerve resection.
Both can cause neural foraminal enlargement.
Target sign&#8594; central hypointensity on T2-weighted images surrounded by a hyperintense periphery.
Seen in both lesions, and suggests benignity.

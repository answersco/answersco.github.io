Acute:
-Severely symptomatic patients with acute PV thrombosis may benefit from endovascular recanalization of PV using catheter-directed thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, and/or stent placement, sometimes in combination with TIPS to provide outflow.

Chronic:
-Typically leads to extensive system of dilated collateral channels in the gastrohepatic ligament and porta hepatis (cavernous transformation), representing dilated paracholedochal and epicholedochal veins.
-Chronic PV thrombosis with cavernous transformation doesn't respond to thrombolysis.
-Recanalization can be performed from either transhepatic, transjugular, or transsplenic approach.
-Once PV has been stented, TIPS should be created to maintain patency.

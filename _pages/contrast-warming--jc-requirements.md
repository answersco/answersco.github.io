title: "Contrast warming: JC requirements"
---
Because CM is designated as a medication, the warming of CM falls under the regulation of JC
IF CM is to be extrinsically warmed, JC mandates:
There must be a daily temperature log for each warmer
Must be evidence of regular maintenance for the warming device

Gadolinium-based CM is administered at room temperature (15-30&#8451;) and should not be externally warmed for routine applications.

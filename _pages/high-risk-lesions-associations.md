1. Radial Scar = (2x risk of invasive cancer) assoc with DCIS or IDC 10-30%; assoc with TUBULAR carcinoma
2. ADH = (4x risk of invasive cancer) high risk basically DCIS (20-30% upgraded on surigcal path)
3. LCIS = (10x risk of invasive cancer) can be precursor to ILC, but doesn't have to be; risk of conversion to invasive cancer is less than DCIS to IDC
4. ALH = (4x risk of invasive cancer) similar to LCIS, but no lobule distention (it IS distended iwth LCIS) = milder than LCIS = still excise

Papilloma described separately

4. ALH = (4x risk of invasive cancer) similar to LCIS, but no lobule distention (it IS distended iwth LCIS) = milder than LCIS = still excise

(Hyperplasia: H looks like &quot;4&quot;); LCIS is worst

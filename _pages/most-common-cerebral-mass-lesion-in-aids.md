title: "Most common cerebral mass lesion in AIDS patients:"
---
Toxoplasmosis&#8594; most common mass lesion in AIDS patients, who become susceptible with CD4 &lt; 100 cells/uL.
2nd most common CNS infection in AIDS behind HIV encephalitis.
Typical appearance: single or multiple ring-enhancing lesions in basal ganglia.
Asymmetric target sign (insensitive, but specific) &#8594; eccentric nodule of enhancement along the enhancing wall of the lesion.
Primary differential consideration of a basal ganglia mass in an immunocompromised patient = CNS lymphoma.
Unlike CNS lymphoma, toxoplasmosis does not demonstrate restricted diffusion and does not demonstrate increased relative cerebral blood volume on perfusion imaging.
Toxoplasmosis is hypometabolic on FDG-PET and not avid or thallium scintigraphy, unlike lymphoma.

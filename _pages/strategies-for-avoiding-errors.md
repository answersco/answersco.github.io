1) avoid use of medical diagnoses within nursing diagnosis statements
-for example: Impaired Gas Exchange R/T COPD
2) use official NANDA nursing diagnoses
3) address only one problem at a time
4) writing a legally inadvisable statement
-for example: Impaired Skin Integrity r/t not being turned every 2 hours

title: "What is the relationship between scatter to primary (s:p) ratio and field of view?"
---
S:P ratio increases as FOV increases, but then levels out at FOV of 30 cm x 30 cm.
S:P ratio increases with increasing kVp, and increases exponentially with patient thickness.
Copper filter causes main energy of the beam to increase and will thus increase S:P ratio.

SMA: supplies distal duodenum, the entire small bowel, and proximal colon from cecum to mid-transverse colon.
Inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery: first branch of SMA &#8594; forms collaterals with celiac artery.
Middle colic artery: arises from SMA and supplies transverse colon&#8594; anastomoses with the marginal artery of Drummond.
Right colic artery: courses retroperitoneally, where it supplies the right colon and hepatic flexure.
Ileocolic artery: terminal artery of SMA&#8594; sends branches to terminal ileum, cecum, and appendix

IMA: originates at left anterior aspect of the aorta at L3-L4
Left colic artery: arises from IMA to supply the descending colon
Sigmoid arteries: variable in number, running in the sigmoid mesocolon to supply the sigmoid colon.
IMA terminates as the superior rectal (hemorrhoidal) artery&#8594; supplies the upper rectum.

Wegener granulomatosis: systemic small-vessel vasculitis with a classic clinical triad of sinusitis, lung involvement, and renal insufficiency.
C-ANCA is positive&#8594; very specific for Wegener granulomatosis
Upper airways: may cause nasopharyngeal and eustachian tube obstruction
Involvement of the larynx and bronchi is common&#8594; leads to airway stenosis
Lungs: may cause multiple cavitary nodules that don't respond to antibiotic therapy. Intra-cavitary fluid level suggests superimposed infection.

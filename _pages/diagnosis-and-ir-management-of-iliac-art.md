title: "Diagnosis and IR management of iliac artery aneurysm:"
---
Iliac artery aneurysm: defined as iliac artery diameter &gt; 1.5 cm
Repair is recommended for diameter &gt; 3.0 cm
Cross-sectional imaging recommended if iliac stenosis is seen first on angiography, as an iliac aneurysm with intraluminal thrombus can simulate an AS stenosis on angiography.
In appropriate candidates, endovascular stent-graft is preferred treatment
Neurologic or urologic symptoms secondary to mass effect from aneurysm necessitates surgical management, as endovascular repair causes slow decrease in aneurysm size.

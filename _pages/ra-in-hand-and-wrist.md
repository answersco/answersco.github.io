title: "RA in hand and wrist:"
---
Typical joints involved are MCPs, PIPs, and carpal articulations.
The DIPs are usually spared
Earliest XR changes are soft tissue swelling and periarticular osteopenia, reflecting synovitis and hyperemia.
Erosions occur early in disease, typically of the radial aspects of the 2nd and 3rd metacarpal heads, the radial and ulnar aspects of the bases of the proximal phalanges, and the ulnar styloid.
Joint subluxations are present in more advanced disease&#8594; not reducible, and lead to several common deformities:
Boutonniere deformity&#8594; PIP flexion and DIP hyperextension
Swan neck deformity&#8594; PIP hyperextension and DIP flexion
Ulnar subluxation of fingers at MCPs
Late-stage RA&#8594; may uncommonly cause ankylosis of the wrist.
Juvenile RA, in contrast, has a higher propensity for carpal ankylosis.

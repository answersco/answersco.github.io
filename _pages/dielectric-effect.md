title: "Dielectric effect:"
---
Appearance&#8594; 
Large-scale signal non-uniformity.
Shading often near the center of the FOV.
Causes&#8594; variation in tissue conductivity.
Common Occurrences&#8594; more prominent with &#8593; field strength scanners (e.g. 3T)
Abdominal Imaging Spinal Imaging
Imaging of large water volume (e.g. pregnancy or ascites) or obese patients.
Remedy&#8594; 
Use dielectric pads (&#8593; electrical conductivity near the patient).
Engage multi-channel transmission, if available on scanner.

AKA standing wave effect
Local eddy current in imaged tissues -&gt; dark signal in central abdomen
Worse with:
- fat people
- ascites
- stronger magnet
Fixed by:
- placing dielectric pads between patient and anterior body coil array
- parallel RF transmission (SENSE) - RF pulses from set of coil, each coil end independent pulse -&gt; longer pulses

Detection of anterior mediastinal mass:
Deformation of the anterior junction line suggests anterior mediastinal mass
Since anterior junction line is not always seen, it is more common to infer the anterior location of a mass by preservation of the posterior lines in the presence of a mass
Hilum overlay sign: present on frontal XR if hilar vessels are visualized through the mass. Indicates that the mass cannot be in the middle mediastinum, and is in the anterior (more likely) or posterior mediastinum.
Obliteration of retrosternal clear space on lateral XR

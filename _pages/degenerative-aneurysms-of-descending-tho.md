title: "Degenerative aneurysms of descending thoracic aorta: appearance and treatment"
---
May be localized or diffuse, but are usually fusiform in contour, have calcified intima, have some associated aortic tortuosity or redundancy, and often contain mural thrombus.
Tortuosity often most notable at diaphragmatic hiatus.
Stranding in mediastinal soft tissue: suggests rapid expansion
Extravascular blood: suggests contained rupture.
Should always take the shorter diameter of noncircular segment of vessel as the true diameter to avoid overestimating.

As with ascending thoracic Ao aneurysms, descending thoracic Ao aneurysms &lt; 6 cm are usually observed.
Focal proximal descending aneurysms are simpler to repair with endovascular rather than surgical technique.
Thoracoabdominal: when the aortic dilatation extends below the diaphragm- generally more complex to treat due to common inclusion of abdominal visceral arteries.

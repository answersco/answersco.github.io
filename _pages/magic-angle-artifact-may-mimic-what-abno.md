Supraspinatus injury

Magic angle artifact: occurs at an angle of 55 degrees to the main magnetic field
Only occurs in tissues with well-ordered collagen fibers in one direction (e.g. tendons or ligaments).
Occurs on low TE sequences, including T1 and PD, and is seen as an area of increased signal at the magic angle
May mimic a supraspinatus injury on rotator cuff MRI.

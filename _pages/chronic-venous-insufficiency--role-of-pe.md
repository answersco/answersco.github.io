title: "Chronic venous insufficiency: role of pelvic veins"
---
Pelvic veins may have a significant role in LE venous insufficiency.
-Iliac vein obstruction may contribute to reflux symptoms, and should be excluded in patients with hx of iliofemoral DVT.
-IIV reflux can contribute to perineal varicose veins, which can in turn contribute to LE varicose veins.
-In women, ovarian vein reflux that is transmitted through the perivaginal veins to the perineum and subsequently the leg can be the sole of contributing cause of LE varicose veins. Hx or complaint of labial varices or pelvic congestion symptoms should suggest this as potential diagnosis.

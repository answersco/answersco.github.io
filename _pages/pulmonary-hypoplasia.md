title: "Pulmonary Hypoplasia"
---
small bell shaped thorax

Def: Congenital lung abnormality that can be primary or secondary
Secondary reasons include lack of vascular supply, small hemithoracic size, decreased fluid
Etiology: MOST COMMON = decreased thoracic volume size from congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Could also be from neuroblastoma or sequestration

Potter sequence: This is for decreased fluid. Abnormal kidneys = no pee = no fluid = hypoplastic lungs (think this would probs be BILATERAL)

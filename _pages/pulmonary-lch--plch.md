Pulmonary Langerhans-cell histiocytosis: smoking-related lung disease (nearly 100% of adults with PLCH are smokers), like RB-ILD and DIP
Multiple smoking-related interstitial lung diseases may be present simultaneously
May present as spontaneous PTX
Most often isolated to lungs&#8594; however, lucent bone lesions, diabetes insipidus from hypophysitis, and skin involvement are occasionally seen.
Other causes of diseases affecting lungs and bones: malignancy, TB, fungal disease (including blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, and coccidiomycosis), sarcoidosis, and Gaucher disease (pulmonary involvement is rare, and may resemble DIP).
First detectable abnormality: nodules associated with the airways
As disease progresses, the nodules cavitate&#8594; resultant irregular cysts predominate
Natural progression is from nodules&#8594; cavitary nodules&#8594; irregular cysts
Imaging findings include upper-lobe predominant cysts and irregular peribronchovascular nodules, both sparing the costophrenic sulci.
Generally steroid-responsive; smoking-cessation is critical.

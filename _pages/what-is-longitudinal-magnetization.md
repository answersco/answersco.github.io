title: "What is longitudinal magnetization?"
---
Longitudinal magnetization (T1 relaxation) &#8594; is the process of proton relaxation under the influence of the static field.
The MZ longitudinal magnetization vector grows exponentially.
T1 relaxation time = the time required for the MZ vector (MZ magnetization) to reach 63% of its maximum value.
Different tissues exhibit uniquely different T1 relaxation times when exposed to the same static field.
With a subsequent T1 relaxation period, the Mz vector relaxes another 63%
When 5 T1 relaxation periods have elapsed&#8594; the tissue has relaxed to &gt;99% of its maximum value&#8594; M0 is saturated.

title: "Arachnoid cyst"
---
Arachnoid cyst of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern is most commonly asymptomatic and incidental when found on CPA or brain MR imaging. The imaging diagnosis is made when this sharply demarcated lesion has MR signal that is the same as cerebrospinal fluid on all MR sequences. The FLAIR MR sequence shows complete fluid attenuation (low signal) while diffusion-weighted imaging shows no diffusion restriction (low signal). CPA arachnoid cyst rarely grows or requires surgical intervention in the adult. The remainder of the answer choices are usually symptomatic at presentation.

common benign lesion, follows CSF, a/w mucopolysaccharidoses (i.e. Hunter's / Hurler's are dilated perivascular spaces)

Modalities: can use MRI or CT for structure and FDG-PET for function
*<b>IMPORTANT</b>* on FDG-PET the motor strip will always be PRESERVED in dementia disorders

Findings:
- hippocampal atrophy is most common finding (first and out of proportion to the rest of the brain)
- Temporal horn atrophy &gt; 3mm seen in 65% of cases
- FDG-PET bilateral low uptake in the tempoparietal regions (ear muffs - see image, this would be on both sides even though image only shows one side)

-a common form of dementia that is characterized by a gradual deterioration of memory, reasoning, language, and eventually, physical function
1) familial: runs in the family, early onset of symptoms if someone in family has it, progression is very quick
2) sporadic: no obvious family history, typically occurs after age 65, those with diabetes have higher risk for Alzheimer's

title: "IMPORTANT: How do you convert equivalent dose to effective dose?"

Multiple by tissue-weighting factor

- if Whole body, then equivalent dose = Effective dose (because tissue weighting factor is 1)
 
* Tissue weighting factor = The relative contribution of that tissue to the overall health detriment to the individual from radiation dose, based primarily on stochastic factors

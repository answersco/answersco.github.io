title: "Rastelli operation"
---
Most commonly used operation for TGA, pulmonary outflow obstruction, and VSD
Placement of baffle within the RV- diverts flow from the VSD to the aorta (basically uses VSD as part of LVOT)
Pulmonic valve oversewn, and conduit inserted between the RV and PA.
Primary advantage: LV becomes systemic ventricle.
Disadvantage: requires additional surgeries since conduit wears down.

title: "Applications of FSE:"
---
FSE is useful when inhomogeneity and magnetic susceptibilities in the magnetic field preclude obtaining high-resolution images by faster pulse sequences.
FSE can be modified to allow for faster 3D imaging techniques, but this results in T2-blurring of the images due to the use of long echo-train acquisition.
Fat suppression&#8594; can help narrow the DDX, as fat and water are both hyperintense on T2-weighted FSE images.

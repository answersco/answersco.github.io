title: "Types of data"
---
Nominal: data values fall into categories or classes without any inherent order. Classify objects according to type or characteristic (e.g. gender, race, subspecialty)

Ordinal: data possess some inherent ordering or rank, but the size of the interval between categories is not uniform or quantifiable. Classify objects according to type or characteristic. Data cannot be averaged. Example: BIRADS classification; assigning excellent, very good, or fair ratings.

Interval: data possess inherent order and the interval between successive values is equal. Data can be averaged. Interval data may be continuous (can take on any value in a continuum, such as temperature in Celsius) or discrete (can take on only specific values, and are expressed in counts, such as # of seizures per month).

Ratio: data are similar to interval data in possessing inherent order and uniform size intervals, but measures reflect a ratio between a continuous quantity and a unit magnitude of the same kind.
Distinguishing feature: can have a natural zero value (e.g. birth weight in kg, % vessel stenosis).

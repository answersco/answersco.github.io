Differential function
Suspected obstruction
Suspecting renal artery stenosis
Suspected complications from transplant
Suspected urine leak

Images obtained posteriorly (anterior if transplant or horseshoe)
3 phases: blood flow, cortical, and clearance phases
Flow: begins within 20 seconds
Cortical: usually starts around 1minute; steep slope is good.
Clearance: normally down to half peak counts at around 7-10 minutes. 20/3 or 20/peak ratios used to quantify retention of tracer.

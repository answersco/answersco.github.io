title: "What do normal ovaries look like in: - premenstrual - premenopausal - postmenopausal"
---
Premenstrual:
- stay small until around age 8-9

Premenopausal:
- normal size up to 15-20 mL
- may be HOT on PET (reason why PET is done during first week of menstrual cycle)

Post-menopausal:
- maximum ovarian volume: 6 mL
- if an ovary it twice the size of the other, it is also abnormal (even if no mass is present)
- should NOT be hot on PET

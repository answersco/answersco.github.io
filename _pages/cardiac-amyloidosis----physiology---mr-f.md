title: "Cardiac Amyloidosis: - physiology - MR findings - MR classic scenario"
---
- seen in 50% of cases of systemic disease

Physiology:
- deposits in myocardial --&gt; abnormal diastolic function with biatrial enlargement

MR findings:
- biatrial enlargement
- concentric LV thickening
- reduced systolic function

Classic Scenario:
- long TI is needed: TI (e.g. 350) needed to suppress myocardium
- blood pool may be darker than the myocardium

title: "Calcific tendinitis"

Most common location = supraspinatous rotator cuff 

Other location = longus colli muscle (see image)

Calcium hydroxyapatite deposition disease (HADD) &#8594; AKA calcific tendinitis
Causes crystals to be deposited in in the periarticular tissues (particularly the tendons), typically sparing the articular cartilage and synovium.
Supraspinatus tendon most commonly affected in the shoulder
Intra-articular variant, called Milwaukee shoulder, leads to rapid destruction of the rotator cuff and glenohumeral joint.
Calcific tendinitis of the prevertebral longus colli muscle &#8594; may cause neck pain, odynophagia, fever, and prevertebral effusion&#8594; may mimic a prevertebral abscess.

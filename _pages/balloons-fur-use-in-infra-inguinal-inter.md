title: "Balloons fur use in infra-inguinal interventions"
---
Typical balloon diameters:
-SFA: 5-7 mm
-Popliteal artery: 4-6 mm
-These are mounted on 5-Fr or smaller catheters

Balloon lengths of 20 cm or more are available for long-segment disease

Rapid-exchange balloon catheters: helpful when working in distal SFA or popliteal A.

Cutting and scoring balloons and debulking devices are useful for recalcitrant stenoses.

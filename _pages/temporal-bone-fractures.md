title: "Temporal bone fractures:"

Longitudinal&#8594; aligned with the long axis of the petrous portion of the temporal bone.
Likely to involve the ossicles&#8594; conductive hearing loss.
20% with facial nerve injury.
Tympanic membrane disruption&#8594; &#8593; risk of acquired cholesteatoma.

Transverse&#8594; perpendicular to the long axis of the petrous temporal bone.
More likely to involve the bony labyrinth&#8594; sensorineural hearing loss.
50% with facial nerve injury.

Longitudinal: 
-more common
-ossicular dislocation --&gt; conductive hearing loss

Transverse
-vascular injury (carotid/jugular)
-facial nerve injury
-sensorineural hearing loss

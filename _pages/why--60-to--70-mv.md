title: "Why -60 to -70 mV?"
---
1) proteins inside the cell that are too big to go anywhere carry a lot of negative charges
2) K+ leak channels to allow K+ to move back and forth by facilitated diffusion
3) Na+: all outside
4) Na+/K+ pump is pushing Na+ against the gradient as well as K+ from the other direction by active transport

---
Selective catheter shapes such as Cobra-2 or Simmons (1 for R renal, 2 for left renal vein)
Requires catheters with multiple sideholes so that large volumes of CM can be injected without trauma to vein.
When extensive filling of intrarenal veins is required, injection of 10 micrograms of epinephrine into renal artery temporarily reduces venous outflow.

Typical renal venography injection rates:
10-15 mL/sec for 2 seconds with rapid filming (3-4 frames/sec)

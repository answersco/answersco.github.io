title: "Normal and abnormal US of celiac artery and SMA"
---
Celiac and major branches: low-resistance waveform. 
PSV &gt; 200 cm/sec in celiac origin indicates at least 70% stenosis
Retrograde flow in common hepatic artery is best predictor of hemodynamically significant celiac artery stenosis. 

SMA: baseline waveform in proximal SMA is high resistance
Post-prandial: induces high-flow, low resists waveform
PSV of at least 275 cm/sec and EDV of at least 45 cm/sec are predictive of SMA stenosis.

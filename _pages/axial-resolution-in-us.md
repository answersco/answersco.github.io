title: "Axial resolution in US"
---
Axial resolution: the ability to distinguish 2 closely-spaced objects in the direction of the beam &#8594; depends on spatial pulse length
Minimum required separation between 2 reflectors in order to distinguish them = &#189; the spatial pulse length (SPL)
Objects closer than &#189; the SPL will not be resolved due to overlapping echoes
SPL = # of cycles emitted per pulse by transducer x wavelength
Axial resolution is independent of depth

Axial resolution is independent of depth
Improves with shorter pulses, greater damping (shorter pulse), and higher frequency (shorter wavelength)

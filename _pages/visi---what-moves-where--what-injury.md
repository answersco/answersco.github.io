title: "VISI - what moves where? What injury?"

Ulnar sided injury to lunortiquetral ligament causes BOTH the scaphoid and lunate to move volarly 

- Scaphoid naturally wants to move volarly, and it takes the lunate along for the ride

SL angle is DECREASED with velar-flexion of the scaphoid and lunate (&lt; 30 degrees) - angle looks like a &quot;V&quot; for &quot;Volar!&quot;

Note that the bones are tilted but not subluxated or dislocated.

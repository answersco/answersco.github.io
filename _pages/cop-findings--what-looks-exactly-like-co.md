title: "COP findings? What looks exactly like COP?"
---
Patchy air space consolidation or GGO in a Peripheral or peribronchial distribution; no fibrosis (history of &quot;being treated for PNA for some time&quot;)

- ATOLL sign (reverse halo) = consolidation around a ground glass CENTER
- Chronic Eosinophilic pneumonia looks EXACTLY THE SAME (always in diff dx = COP + CEP) = h/o ASTHMA

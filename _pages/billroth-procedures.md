title: "Billroth procedures"
---
Billroth 1:
- this is where the pylorus is removed and the remaining stomach is sewed to the duodenum
- FEWER gastric ulcers (i guess due to duodenal juices)
- Done for pyloric dysfunction, gastric CA, or ulcers

Billroth 2: 
- Partial gastrectomy with stomach remnant sewed to the JEJUNUM
- Can get dumping syndrome
- Can get Afferent loop syndrome
- Risk of CA increases 10-20 years after procedure 

Roux-en-Y
- Stomach is divided to make a pouch and attached to the jejunum (gastrojejunal limb) and the stomach remnant, duodenum, and jejunum are hooked to a downstream part of the jejunum (jejuno-jejunal limb)

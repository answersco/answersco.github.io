title: "What is transient equilibrium?"
---
Equilibrium = parent and daughter isotope concentration is EQUAL

When half life of daughter is shorter than the parent, but not by much 
- e.g. Moly 99 generator making Tc99 
- Transient equilibrium occurs after 4 half lives (parent and daughter activities are only PARTLY equal)

title: "STIR"

Short TI Inverstion Recovery
This is used to saturate fat due to the fact that fat has a SHORT T1

STIR cannot be used with gadolinium (gd enhanced tissue have a similar T1 to fat therefore you acutually end up supressing what you want to see)

Short T1 inversion recovery
Short TI (120-160 ms) -&gt; suppresses fat
Less susceptibility artifact and field inhomogeneity than other fat suppression techniques (good with metal)
Cannot use with gad (enhanced tissues have similar T1 to fat -&gt; get nulled out)

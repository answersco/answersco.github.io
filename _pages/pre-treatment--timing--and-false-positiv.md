title: "Pre-treatment, timing, and false-positive and negative in Meckel's scan"
---
Study needs to be performed when patient is not bleeding (bleeding study if bleeding)
Pre-treatment:
-Pentagastrin: enhances uptake of pertechnetate by gastric mucosa and stimulates GI activity.
-H2 blockers (cimetidine): blocks secretion of pertech out of gastric cells, making it stick around longer.
-Glucagon: slows gastric motility

False positive: bowel irritation (recent scope, laxatives)
False negative: recent in vivo labeling of RBCs, recent barium study (Attenuated).

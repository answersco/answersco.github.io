title: "3 basic types of embolic protection devices"
---
Distal filters, distal occlusion balloons, and proximal occlusion balloons with or without flow reversal.

Filtration devices: permit continued antegrade flow of blood unless a large volume of debris is collected.
-Limitation: small debris can pass through the filter.

Distal occlusion balloons: prevent all emboli while inflated, but do not allow any antegrade flow during procedure, and rely on complete aspiration of debris to prevent emboli after deflation.

Proximal occlusion devices: also prevent antegrade flow.
-Usually rely on reversal of flow rather than aspiration to remove debris.

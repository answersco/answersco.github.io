Effective Dose = Organ absorbed dose * the tissue weighting factor  4. Tissue weighting factor = sensitivity of the organ to radiation  5. Total effective dose = sum of all these products  6. Calculated based on: -absorbed dose -harm level of the radiation type -sensitivity of the organs  7. Gives an idea of long term patient risks and can be used to compare the risk of different types of exams (head CT versus Nuc Med study"

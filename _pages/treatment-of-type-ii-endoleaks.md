title: "Treatment of type II endoleaks"
---
Type II: enlargement of aneurysm in presence of type II perfusion is considered an indication for intervention. Stable or shrinking aneurysms can be monitored.

Type II endoleaks are analogous to AVMs- multiple feeding vessels to a single central nidus.
-The nidus is usually a channel or space within the intra-aneurysmal thrombus that communicates with lumbar, median sacral, IMA, gonadal, or accessory renal arteries.
-As with AVM, occlusion of branch arteries isn't sufficient because additional branches will be recruited over time.
-To effectively treat type II endoleak, the central space must be obliterated, either via retrograde access through one of the branches or direct puncture of the aneurysm.

Levels of probability
High probability
2 or more large mismatched segmental defects or equivalent moderate/large defects with a normal x-ray
any perfusion defect substantially larger than radiographic abnormality

Intermediate probability
multiple perfusion defects with associated radiographic opacities
greater than 25% of a segment and less than 2 mismatched segmental perfusion defects with:
normal radiograph
one moderate segmental
one large or two moderate segmental
one large and one moderate segmental
three moderate segmental
triple match : solitary moderate-large matching segmental defect with matching radiograph difficult to characterize as high probability or low probability

Low probability
nonsegmental defects-small effusion blunting costophrenic angle, cardiomegaly, elevated diaphragm, ectatic aorta
any perfusion defect with substantially larger radiographic abnormality matched ventilation and perfusion defects with normal chest radiograph small subsegmental perfusion defects

Normal scan
no perfusion defects

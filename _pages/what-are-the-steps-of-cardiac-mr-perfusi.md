title: "What are the steps of cardiac MR Perfusion?"

Before imaging, adenosine is administered to maximally vasodilate the entire coronary bed to uncover regional differences in blood flow due to a stenosis. 

Then contrast enhanced SSFP images are acquired during first pass of contrast and ischemic areas are identified by decreased enhancement during first pass.

Next, rest images are acquired by repeating the technique in the absence of adenosine to identify perfusion defects. 

Finally, delayed images are obtained and if a perfusion defect, seen on rest images, persists it is more likely to be an infarct. Artifact will not have delayed enhancement.

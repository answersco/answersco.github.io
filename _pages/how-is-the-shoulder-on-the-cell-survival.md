title: "How is the shoulder on the cell survival curve related to LET?"
---
Shoulder of the survival curve is most pronounced for low LET radiations, and minimal for high-LET radiations.
For a given particle, the higher the energy, the lower the LET (and the lower the biological effectiveness). For a given energy, LET increases with the mass of the particle.
LET = energy transferred per unit length of the track, measured in keV/m
Steeper curve (less shoulder) = more lethal with higher LET
X-rays and gamma rays = low LET (sparsely ionizing)
Energetic neutrons, protons, and heavy charged particles are high LET.

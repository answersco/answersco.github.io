The probability of CS interactions is independent of absorber atomic number because the incoming photons interact with loosely bound or free electrons that are not influenced by the charge of the nucleus. The probability of CS interactions decreases gradually with increasing photon energy over the diagnostic energy range. In addition, CS is proportional to material physical density. Above 25-30 keV, CS is the dominant photon interaction in soft tissue over the diagnostic range of photon energies. This results in a degradation in image quality unless measures are taken to remove the scattered photons by using a grid or an air gap.

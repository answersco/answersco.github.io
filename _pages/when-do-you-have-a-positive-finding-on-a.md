title: "When do you have a positive finding on a combined Tc-Sulfur colloid &amp; Indium-111 WBC scan for infection? In spine?"
---
Area of increased uptake on the In-111 WBC imaging with a corresponding area of LOW activity on the Sulfur Colloid (due to abnormal bone marrow there becoming photogenic)

- this is also good for neuropathic foot diabetic infection! (consider 24 hour '4th phase' for them to distinguish between delayed soft tissue clearance or actual bony uptake)


* In the SPINE, use Gallium Scan instead of In-111, but the same principal holds (More uptake on gallium with corresponding photopenia on sulfur colloid is positive)

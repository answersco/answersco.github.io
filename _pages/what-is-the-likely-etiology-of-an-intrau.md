title: "What is the likely etiology of an intrauterine filling defect in a 38 year old female that is hypointense compared to normal endometrium on T1 and T2?"
---
Answer: submucosal leiomyoma
FIbroids are classically low signal on both T1 and T2-weighted sequences, though signal characteristics can become more complex if they become degenerative.
Like fibroids, endometriomas can also present as low signal on T1 and T2 due to hemosiderin-laden macrophages, but they shouldn't present as an intrauterine filling defect.
Endometrial polyp should roughly follow the MR signal of the adjacent normal endometrium with intermediate T1 signal and high T2 signal.
Endometrial carcinoma may be T1 hypointense, but is typically mildly T2-hyperintense.

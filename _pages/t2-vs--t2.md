title: "T2 vs. T2*"
---
Signal of T2 decays faster than predicted by tissue-spin interactions alone, because the field is not entirely homogeneous, creating additional interaction that further speeds decay.
Thus, T2* decay is ALWAYS faster than T2.
T2* = tissue-spin interaction + field inhomogeneity
T2 = tissue spin interaction only 

Fixing T2* and making it T2: at 1/2 the time of TE, a 180 degree pulse can be given to refocus the signal, helping to remove the fixed field inhomogeneity.

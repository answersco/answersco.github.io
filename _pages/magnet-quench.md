title: "Magnet quench:"
---
Quench = a rapid loss of superconductivity in the wire (~ 5 minutes)
&#8594; as a result, all the energy stored in the magnetic field is rapidly dispersed into the wire as heat&#8594; causes rapid evaporation of the liquid He coolant.
&#8594; the magnet then loses its magnetic field and requires extensive work to restore it to an operational state.

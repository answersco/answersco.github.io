title: "T2-dark renal cystic lesion"
---
T2-dark renal cystic lesion: simple cyst should be T2-bright 

Lipid-poor AML: 30% of AMLs in TS are lipid-poor, commonly multiple

Hemorrhagic cyst: will likely be T1 bright

Papillary RCC: unlike clear-cell, which is T2-bright
Both clear-cell and papillary will enhance, but clear cell enhances more avidly (equal to cortex on CM phase).

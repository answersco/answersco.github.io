Delayed enhancement: ischemic cardiomyopathy (CM)
Delayed enhancement post-infarction will extend from the subendocardium to the epicardium in a vascular distribution. 
Subendocardial: since endocardium is most susceptible to ischemia, ischemic-type delayed enhancement will always involve the subendocardial surface and should have a vascular territory. After remodelling, a chronic infarct will demonstrate delayed enhancement.
Transmural delayed enhancement: ischemic-type delayed enhancement may involve the endocardium only or may be transmural, which extends across the entire myocardial thickness.
Transmural DE: represents nonviable scar from prior transmural infarct.
Cine images usually show hypokinesis in the area of abnormal DE.

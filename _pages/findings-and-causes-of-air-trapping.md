Areas of lung that are more lucent than others
Technically can only be called on expiration (since hypoperfusion in PA HTN can look similar)

Consider bronchiolitis obliterans in lung transplant (this constrictive bronchiolitis can also be seen with viral illness, drug reaction, or inhalation injury).
Small airway disease- asthma/bronchiolitis

throw sub-acute Hypersensitivity Peumonitis in this group as well

MIMIC=Pulmonary arterial hypertension areas of hypoperfusion
 - expiratory phase study to differentiate

title: "Posterior Urethral Valves"
---
Distinct caliber change in urethra at level of valves
Actual valve tissue is very thin and may not be directly visible
Occurs exclusively in males
Diagnosis made on voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), cystoscopy, or, outside the USA, on cystosonography

bilateral hyrdo

Obstructing web in the posterior (prostatic) urethra.
Most common congenital bladder outlet obstruction.
US shows dilated prostatic urethra, dilated trabeculated bladder, &amp; hydro.
The dilated prostatic urethra &amp; bladder produce a &quot;keyhole&quot; appearance.
Ddx: Prune belly syndrome (whole urethra would be dilated)

Posterior urethral valves&#8594; most common cause of congenital bladder outlet obstruction, caused by obstructing web in posterior (prostatic) urethra
US: dilation of posterior (prostatic) urethra; dilated, trabeculated bladder; hydronephrosis. Dilated posterior urethra and bladder create keyhole sign.
Main differential consideration is prune belly syndrome, which would show dilation of the entire ureter rather than only the prostatic portion.

Congenital obstruction of the posterior urethral due to a membranous flap in the proximal urethra

Most common cause of bladder outlet obstruction in the male neonate (ONLY SEEN IN MALES)
Most specific finding is an abrupt transition between dilated and non-dilated urethra (posterior ureth dilated, ant ureth not dilated)
Another classic appearance is KEY HOLE bladder on MRI

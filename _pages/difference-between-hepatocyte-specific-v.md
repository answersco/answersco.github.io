title: "Difference between hepatocyte specific vs extracellular gadolinium agents? uses of both?"

Extracellular:
- stay outside the cell and are blood flow dependent (like CT contrast)
- cause T1 shortening

Hepatocyte specific:
- taken up by normal hepatocytes and excreted into the bile
- use when proving an FNH, bile leaks, for picking new lesions after baseline

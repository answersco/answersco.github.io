title: "Lead-time bias"
---
- Period of time between detection of disease by screening and when it would have been diagnosed due to symptoms 
- Short lead time -&gt; treatment of disease found by screening no more effective than treatment after symptoms
- Long lead time -&gt; time from diagnosis to death longer for screened patients, but survival unchanged 
- Avoided by comparing age-specific mortality rates instead of survival rates from the time of diagnosis

- false estimate of survival rates 
- early detection looks like increase in survival
- common with improved screening

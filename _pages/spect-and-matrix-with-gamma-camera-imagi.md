title: "SPECT and matrix with gamma camera imaging"
---
When improved spatial resolution is needed, SPECT can be performed by rotating a camera 180 or 360 degrees around the patient
-The longer you image on SPECT, the better it looks, but higher risk of motion

Matrix size: 128 x 128 has superior resolution than 64 x 64.
-Larger matrix size also means longer acquisition and reduced count density per pixel (which affects image contrast).

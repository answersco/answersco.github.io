title: "Pes Planus"
---
Flat foot
This can be congenital or acquired
If congenital, the FLEXIBLE subtype is more common in kids. 
You can figure out rigid vs flexible flat foot with plantar flexion views
 RIGID subtypes of pes planus include TARSAL COALITION or VERTICAL TALUS 
BOTH types have a hindfoot valgus (this is seperating or widening of the angle between the talus and calcaneus)

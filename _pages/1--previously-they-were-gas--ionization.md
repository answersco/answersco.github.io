title: "1. Previously they were gas (Ionization chambers with xenon)  -the absorption efficiency of these is 60-80%  ------------------------ currently we use solid state detectors  these have an absorption efficiency of 100%  -they are made out of ceramic -early designs: CsI -currently Bismuth Germinate or Cadmium tunstate  --------- solid versus xenon detectors: -less stable highe absorption efficicency higher SNR -less beam hardening"

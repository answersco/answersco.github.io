title: "IMPORTANT: Difference between Equivalent dose and effective dose?"
---
Equivalent Dose attempts to quantify biologic damage by different types of radiation (Sv)
- Uses a radiation weighting factor (e.g. &quot;1&quot; for XR, gamma rays, and beta particles)


Effective dose is due to nonuniform dose distribution in a patient. It takes into account Equivalent dose to each organ and the organ's relative radio sensitivity (have to multiple each and then add)

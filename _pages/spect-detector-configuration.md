title: "SPECT detector configuration:"
---
Dual detector systems for cardiac imaging &#8594; typically used in a 90&#176; configuration, sometimes called the &quot;L-mode.&quot;
For both gated myocardial perfusion and gated blood pool SPECT &#8594; the most commonly used arc for data acquisition is -45&#176; RAO view down to the +135V LPO view.
Reconstruction artifacts &#8594; start to become apparent for tilt angles &gt; 10&#176; for myocardial perfusion data acquired from -45&#176; RAO view to +135&#176; LPO 
Whole body tomograms (e.g. liver SPECT) &#8594; more commonly use 2 detectors configured at 180&#176; opposed angles, sometimes called &quot;H-mode.&quot;

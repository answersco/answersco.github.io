title: "Inversion Recovery (IR) SE technique:"
---
A 180&#176; RF pulse inverts tissue magnetization&#8594; suppresses selected tissue
During the inversion time (TI) &#8594; T1 relaxation processes cause different tissues to return toward equilibrium magnetization values at different rates.
The amount of T1 relaxation that occurs during TI will affect image contrast.
A standard spin echo acquisition sequence is then performed.
Allows for high signal intensity of fluid or edema.

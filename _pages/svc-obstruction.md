title: "SVC obstruction:"
---
facial and upper extremity edema and cyanosis. 
Chronic obstruction: may be asymptomatic, or produce facial edema that improves with standing.
Most common causes of SVC obstruction: compression by thoracic malignancy, catheter-associated thrombosis, and mediastinal fibrosis after histoplasmosis exposure.
Classic cross-sectional finding in SVC syndrome is &#8593; enhancement of hepatic segment IVa due to collateral opacification of the vein of Sappey.
Vein of Sappey drains the liver in the region of the falciform ligament and communicates with the internal thoracic veins, which act as collateral vessels in the setting of SVC occlusion.
Combined internal jugular and femoral approaches may be necessary for treatment, often requiring stenting.

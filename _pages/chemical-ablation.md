Most commonly ethanol (PEI)
-PEI: Safe, inexpensive, and effective for small (3-5 cm) HCC.
-Effective for encapsulated tumors like HCC where surrounding tissue is made firm by underlying disease (cirrhotic liver). Injected alcohol diffuses through the tumor but is prevented from diffusing into liver by the tumor capsule and surrounding cirrhotic parenchyma.
-Less effective for mets because they are often firm tumors surrounded by normal tissue.
-Volume injected based on calculated tumor size, considered as a sphere. Injections may need to be repeated on a weekly basis until calculated volume achieved.
-Not commonly used in US because multiple treatments needed and decreased efficacy for CRC mets.

title: "More common approach to LE runoff imaging"
---
More common approach is to image sequential overlapping levels of the pelvis and legs during a long continuous contrast injection using motorized tables, C-arms, or both.
-Although less overall contrast is typically used compared to stationary runs, the likelihood of underfilling of vessel segments is greater.
-Test injection of a small amount of contrast (10-20 mL) at the Ao bifurcation with imaging at the knees allows assessment of the symmetry of flow. Imaging stations, technique, and patient positioning are then set.
-Scout images of the legs are obtained followed immediately by contrast injection and DSA.
-Manually-activated changes in table position (&quot;bolus chase&quot;) are based on real-time assessment of vascular opacification.
-Single phase injections or dual phase with one rate in the pelvis followed by lower rate in extremities to increase to increase the overall duration of the injection.
-Typical single-phase injection: full-strength or diluted CM injected at 6-10 mL/sec for 10-12 seconds.
-Typical dual phase injection: might use 10 mL/sec in pelvis followed by 6 mL/sec for legs.

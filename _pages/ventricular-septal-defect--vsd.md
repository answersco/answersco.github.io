title: "Ventricular septal defect (VSD)"
---
Ventricular septal defect (VSD) &#8594; typically present after 1st month as pulmonary vascular resistance falls. 70% membranous, 30% muscular septum.
Primarily causes dilation of the left heart.
Left-to-right shunting occurs in systole&#8594; causes volume overload of left heart and subsequent LA and LV dilation.
Imaging findings are variable depending on the size of the VSD.
Classic findings of shunt vascularity and cardiomegaly usually take a few years to develop, though there may be mild cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular flow shortly after birth.
LA is often enlarged, which may splay the main-stem bronchi at the carina.

title: "Typical findings in meconium plug syndrome:"

Also known as neonatal &quot;small left colon,&quot; this is an immaturity of the distal colon that is classically seen in patients whose mother received magnesium sulfate for preeclampsia or had diabetes. 
 A contrasted enema will show a small distal colon up to the level of the splenic flexure classically. Plugs of meconium may be visualized in the colon (though these are the result of the functional obstruction rather than its cause). This appearance cannot be differentiated from a high transition Hirschsprung disease. The initially abnormal distal colon of meconium plug syndrome typically acquires normal function within a few days of life.

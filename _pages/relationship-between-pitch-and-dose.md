title: "Relationship between pitch and dose"
---
Doses in helical scanning with pitch of 1.0 are similar to those from axial scanning
Pitch &lt; 1.0 &#8594; dose increases because slices overlap
PItch &gt; 1.0&#8594; dose decreases because energy is more spread out
Relationship is proportional: pitch of 2 halves the dose; pitch of 0.5 doubles dose.

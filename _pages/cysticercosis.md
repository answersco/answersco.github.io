Caused by larvae of pork tapeworm Taenia solium. Ingested eggs hatch in intestine and larvae are hematogenously distributed, forming cysticerci. 3 stages of CNS disease: Early phase, edema and/or nodular enhancement. Later, peripheral viable cysts. Scolex may be seen as small mural nodule. Late phase, peripheral calcifications without edema or enhancement.

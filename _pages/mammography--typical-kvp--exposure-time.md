title: "Mammography: typical kVp, exposure time, mAs"
---
-Voltage: 22-40 kVp 
Average energy of 16-23 keV &#8594; shown to provide an optimal balance between radiation dose and image quality for most applications in mammography.
Requires applying a 25-30 kVp voltage to x-ray tube (versus typical kVp of 50-120 for general radiographic imaging)
Higher kVp used in digital MM
-Exposure time&#8594; typically 1-2 s for contact MM (may be longer for dense and/or thick breasts)
-Typical tube current exposure time product is ~ 150 mAs

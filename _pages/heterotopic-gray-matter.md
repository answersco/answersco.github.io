title: "Heterotopic Gray Matter"
---
Ectopic nodule or ribbon, isointense with gray matter (GM) on every MR sequence
Periventricular, subcortical/transcerebral, molecular layer
Subependymal HTP located next to periventricular white matter (GZ of cerebral mantle) but not in corpus callosum (fiber tract) or next to basal ganglia (GZ of ganglionic eminence)
Variable: From tiny to huge, isolated to diffuse
Thin slice, high-definition 3D acquisition, heavily weighted T1 provides optimal contrast and definition
Large nodular HTP: Often thinned, polymicrogyric-looking overlying cortex

Islands of gray matter anywhere between ependymal surface and subcortical white matter. May cause seizures.

Heterotopia is due to arrested/disrupted migration of groups of neurons from the periventricular germinal zone to the cortex. Subependymal heterotopia are located next to the periventricular white matter but not in the corpus callosum or next to the basal ganglia. Most common presentations include seizures and decreased cognitive function. They can be commonly associated with other anomalies, such as polymicrogyria, schizencephaly, dysgenesis of corpus callosum, Chiari 2 malformation, and large cisterna magna. Palliative surgery is reserved for intractable seizures.

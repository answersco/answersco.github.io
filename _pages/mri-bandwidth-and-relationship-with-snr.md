title: "MRI bandwidth and relationship with SNR:"
---
Bandwidth (BW) = sampling rate / # of samples
Smaller bandwidth&#8594; &#8593; SNR, but also can cause spatial distortions and &#8593; chemical shift.
Larger bandwidth&#8594; &#8595; SNR, but allows faster imaging
Proper selection of digital BW has a major impact on the final image quality &#8594;BW influences SNR, motion artifacts, the magnitude of fat shift, and the selection of available TE values.
If there is a mismatch between the digital and analog BW settings, huge artifacts will likely occur.
Rule of thumb&#8594; use as wide a BW as the image SNR allows to minimize other limitations.

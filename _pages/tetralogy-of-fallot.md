High VSD. Pulmonary stenosis (usually infundibular. with or without valvular stenosis). Right ventricular hypertrophy. Aorta overrides VSD.

Most common cyanotic CHD
1. Obstructed RV outflow tract - pulmonary infundibular or valve stenosis
2. RV hypertrophy
3. VSD
4. Aorta overriding interventricular septum

Blood from hypertrophied RV travels across VSD preferentially (because of stenosis of RV outflow tract) to aorta: R to L shunt

CXR: Enlarged RV, decreased pulmonary vasculature
Repair: shunt blood from systemic to pulmonary artery (ex. Blalock-Taussig shunt - subclavian to PA)

- VSD
- RVOT (determines severity)
- RV hypertrophy'
- Overriding aorta

---
Risk factors: prior reaction (5X risk), any other allergic history (shellfish allergy thought not to be significant), atopy (2-3X risk), and asthma.
Preferred premedication regimens utilize oral meds with at least 6 hours from initial administration of CM

I: Prednisone: 50 mg PO at 13 hours, 7 hours, and 1 hour before CM injection. 
Plus diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, IM, or PO 1 hour before injection (reduces frequency of urticaria, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms)

II: methylpredisolone (Medrol): 32 mg PO 12 hours and 2 hours before injection.
Anti-histamine can also be added.
If unable to take PO, 200 mg hydrocortisone IV may be substituted for oral prednisone.

title: "Pediatric drug dose"
---
1) until a child is about 2y.o. they require higher doses of water soluble medications.
-children are more likely to get dehydrated because they have higher amounts of extra cellular fluid
2) as for fat soluble medications, children and infants require LESS of a dose, because they have less fat tissue stores. 
-less protein receptor sites available for binding with medication &amp; neonates have less albumin = higher risk if using high protein binding drugs

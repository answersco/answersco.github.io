title: "How to distinguish diaphragmatic eventration from paralysis on lateral CXR?"
---
In diaphragmatic eventration, the anterior 1/2 or 2/3 of the hemidiaphragm is typically affected. When a hemidiaphragm is paralyzed, the entirety of the hemidiaphragm is elevated, including the posterior portion.

* So look to see that the posterior diaphragms are basically at the same level for EVENTRATION

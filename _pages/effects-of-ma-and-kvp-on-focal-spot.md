title: "Effects of mA and kVp on focal spot"
---
Actual focal spot enlarges with an &#8593; in mA because the &#8593; # of electrons start to repel each other&#8594; &quot;blooming&quot; or widening of the beam&quot;
Repulsion is most significant at low kV
With &#8593; kV, you can get a slight &#8595; or &quot;thinning&quot; of the focal spot

High mA, low kVp = wider spot &quot;blooming&quot;
High kVp = smaller spot &quot;thinning&quot;

Oncocytoma: most commonly resected benign renal mass, with overlapping imaging findings with RCC
Imaging findings can suggest oncocytoma, but are nonspecific
Homogeneous enhancement
Central scar

Looks a lot like RCC, but with central scar &#8594; can't be distinguished via imaging
Will show solid mass with central scar, US &quot;spoke-wheel&quot; vascular pattern, or PET/CT with lesion hotter than surrounding renal cortex (RCC typically colder than surrounding parenchyma on PET)
Birt-Hogg-Dube: associated with bilateral oncocytomas and chromophobe RCC

Looks a lot like RCC, but with central scar &#8594; can't be distinguished via imaging

Distinguishing features:
=Solid mass with central scar
-US &quot;spoke-wheel&quot; vascular pattern
-PET/CT with lesion hotter than surrounding renal cortex (RCC typically colder than surrounding parenchyma on PET)

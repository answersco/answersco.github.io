title: "Antiviral action of interferons"
---
-initially, the infected cells know they are being attacked by viruses and it triggers them to release and produce interferons
-before the infected cells die, they produce interferons and secrete it outside of the cell
-the interferons then spread throughout the area and help nearby cells that are not affected
-it acts as a signal and tells the nearby cell it is being infecting and it needs to do something to slow down or stop the infection
-that way when it does become infected, the nearby cell is ready and the antiviral proteins slow down the replication of viruses inside the cell

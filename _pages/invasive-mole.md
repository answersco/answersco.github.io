title: "Invasive mole"
---
Invasion of molar tissue into myometrium
Typically seen after tx of hydatidiform mole
US: may show echogenic tissue in myometrium
MRI: better at demonstrating muscle invasion, showing focal myometrial masses, dilated vessels, and areas of hemorrhage and necrosis.

Choriocarcinoma: spreads locally (into myometrium and parametrium) and then hematogenously anywhere.
Very vascular.
Classic scenario: b-hcg levels rise in 8-10 weeks following evacuation of molar pregnancy.
US: choriocarcinoma appears as highly echogenic solid mass.
Tx = methotrexate

-molar tissue invading myometrium
-US: echogenic tissue in myometrium
-MR: myometrial masses, dilated vessels, necrosis

persistent local dz &amp; elevated B-hcg after removal of mole

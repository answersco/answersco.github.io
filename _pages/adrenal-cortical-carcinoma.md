Adrenal cortical carcinoma: 66% are functional&#8594; may manifest as Cushing syndrome, hyperaldosteronism, and/or virilization.
Imaging: usually a large, heterogeneous mass, with common central necrosis and hemorrhage.

LARGE (4-10 cm), calcify 20% of time, heterogenous enhancement, spread 1st by direct invasion followed by metting everywhere else

IF lesion is &lt; 5 cm then cortical carcinoma is unlikely. Also these **** boys like to centrally necrosis.

title: "TGC- time gain compensation = DGC = depth gain"
---
compensate for attenuation (scatter and absorption) - corresponding to power and material (attenuation coefficient) 
compensates for depth - so surface isnt bright and depth dark- but need to just for organs when attenuation is higher than norm ie fatty liver

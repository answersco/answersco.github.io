title: "Germinal matrix hemorrhage"
---
germinal matrix = vascular tissue near caudothalamic groove
ONLY exists: 24-32 weeks

caudothalamic groove
grade I: confined to gm
II: extends into ventricles
III: with ventriculomegaly
IV: extends into parenchyma

Seen in premature infants 
Generally by 32 weeks, germinal matrix is only present in the caudothalamic groove 
By 36 weeks, there is no germinal matrix there therefrore you cant have this in older children
Up to 40% of GMH occur in the first 5 hours of life and most have occured (90%) by day 4 of life 

Grading system is 1-4
1. Restricted to subepindymal region within the caudothalamic groove 
2. Extension into normal size ventricle, nl filling less than 50% of vent
3. Extension into dilated ventricle
4. Grade 3 PLUS intraparynchyma hemorrhage

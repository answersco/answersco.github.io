Life-Span Studies- published in BEIR VII
LSS studies of Japanese survivors showed increased incidence of cancers above doses of about 100 mGy, with rate of cancer incidence &#8593; linearly with increasing dose above 100 mGy.
Data from Japan failed to show statistically-significant evidence of higher cancer rates below about 100 mGy
For doses &lt; 100 mGy, increase in radiation-induced cancers is too small to be distinguishable from spontaneous rate of cancer incidence.
Studies showed no genetic effects of radiation in the offspring of survivors.

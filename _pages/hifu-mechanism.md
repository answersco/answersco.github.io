title: "HIFU mechanism"
---
US waves generated by PZT elements are focused either through a spherical arrangement, acoustic lens, or paraboloid reflectors.
-The wave is transmitted between the US source and the patient's skin through degassed water.
-Sound waves converge at a predetermined focal point, causing a large amount of focused power deposition, leading to thermonecrosis.

Hypersplenism: syndrome of platelet sequestration by an enlarged spleen.
Seconondary cases may be caused by portal HTN, neoplasm, Gaucher disease, or myeloproliferative disorder.

Partial embo of the spleen results in elevation of the platelet count and preservation of sufficient tissue for reticuloendothelial function.
Embo should be from a distal position rather than proximal coil occlusion, using Gelfoam pledgelets soaked in antibiotics.

Can also perform complete embo (infarction) of the spleen in poor surgical candidates, or pre-operative splenic embo prior to splenectomy.

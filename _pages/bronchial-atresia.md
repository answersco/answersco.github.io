title: "Bronchial atresia:"
---
Bronchial atresia&#8594; interruption of a bronchial branch with associated distal mucus impaction and hyperinflation, usually involving LUL.
Bronchi distal to atretic segment become filled with mucus&#8594; form a tubular mucocele.
Distal airways demonstrate air-trapping, resulting in local hyperinflation.
Imaging: geographic region of hyperlucent lung with air-trapping. Mucous plug may be visible just distal to obstructed bronchial segment.

Most commonly involves apical-posterior LUL
Usual look is a blind-ending bronchus filled with mucus (&quot;finger-in-glove&quot;)
Hyperinflation of distal lung.
V/Q scintigraphy: Hypoperfusion &amp; absent or delayed ventilation of affected pulmonary segment

This is most common in the left posterior apical lobe
- You will see a blind ending bronchis with mucous plugging
- The DISTAL portion of the lung will be HYPERINFLATED from collateral airway drift

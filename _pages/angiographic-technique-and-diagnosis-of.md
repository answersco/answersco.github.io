title: "Angiographic technique and diagnosis of GI bleeding"
---
Technique: image acquisition should be rapid (3-6 frames/sec) in arterial phase, then slower for venous phase. Portal phase is mandatory since bleeding can be due to varices or mesenteric venous thrombosis.
Digital images should be reviewed in substracted and unsubtracted modes to confirm diagnosis.
IV glucagon decreases artifact from bowel gas on DSA
Use of Foley catheter improves visualization of distal sigmoid and rectum.

Diagnosis: based on visualization of contrast extravasation into bowel lumen. 
-Contrast should appear during arterial phase, persist through venous phase, and change with time.

title: "Nerve root origin and herniation location:"
---
In the thoracic and lumbar spine, each nerve root exits below its corresponding vertebral body (e.g. L4 nerve root exits below the L4 vertebral body at L4-L5)
In the cervical spine, each root exits above its corresponding vertebral body (e.g. C7 nerve root exits above the C7 vertebral body at C6-C7).
At the cervicothoracic transition, the C8 nerve root exits below the C7 vertebral body and the T1 nerve root exits below the T1 vertebral body.

Herniation:
Medial (central or paracentral) herniation &#8594; will affect the descending nerve root corresponding to the level below the disc (e.g. herniation at L4-L5 will affect the descending L5 root).
Lateral (foraminal or far-lateral) herniation &#8594; will affect the exiting nerve root (e.g. herniation at L4-L5 will affect the exiting L4 nerve root).

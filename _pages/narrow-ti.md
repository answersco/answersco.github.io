-a small margin of safety 
-a very small window where a medication can go from therapeutic to toxic
-monitoring the pt's lab values and sepsis bc it has more damaging affects on the organs
-if taking on out-patient basis, they would have to come in every month for lab values to be taken to make sure it is still being therapeutic

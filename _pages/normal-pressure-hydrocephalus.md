title: "Normal pressure hydrocephalus"
---
Chronic, low-level form of hydrocephalus. Clinical triad: Dementia, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence. CSF pressure is within normal limits. Slight gradient exists between ventricular system and subarachnoid space due to incomplete subarachnoid CSF block. Commonly results from prior subarachnoid hemorrhage or meningitis. Diffuse ventriculomegaly out of proportion to sulcal prominence. Early entry of radiotracer into lateral ventricles, with persistence at 24 and 48 hours. Delay ascent to parasagittal region.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus: Communicating hydrocephalus
&quot;Ventricular size out of proportion to atrophy.&quot; Present with ataxia, AMS, and urinary incontinence.
Frontal and temporal horns of lateral ventricles most affected
&quot;Upward bowing of corpus callosum&quot;
Treated with surgical shunting

Ideopathic, uncertain the etiology
Anterior and lateral portions of the lateral ventricles are most affected
You can see upward bowing of the corpus collosum 
Ventricular enlargement is OUT OF PROPORTION to atrophy
Crowding of the gyri at the vertex 
You can see transependymal flow AND/OR a FLOW VOID at the cerebral acquiduct (see image)

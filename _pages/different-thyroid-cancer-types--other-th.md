Papillary thyroid; microcalcs; mets via lymphatics

Follicular
- hematogenous mets
- but also responds to I-131 like papillary!
* Hurthle = variant of Follicular that does NOT respond to I-131 as well as normal follicular (have to use FDG-PET for surveillance)

Anaplastic = old people with prior radiation
- rapidly grows and spreads via lymphatics
* Does NOT respond to I-131

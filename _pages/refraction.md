title: "Refraction"
---
Bending of a soundwave caused by a change in speed

Influencers of refraction:
1. Speed change (which is based on tissue compression)
2. Angle of incidence 

NO refraction occurs if there is NO change in speed OR if the angle of incidence is PERPENDICULAR

Sin angle 1/Sin angle 2 = speed2/speed1

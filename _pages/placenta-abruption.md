title: "Placenta Abruption"
---
Premature separation of the placenta from the myometrium 
The really bad one is RETROPLACENTAL abruption where you see anechoic or mixed echogenecity fluid tracking behind the placenta

The mimic of this condition is a MYOMETRIAL contraction or a friboid. These enetities will DISPLACE the retroplacental complex where as a true abruption will DISRUPT the retroplacental complex of blood vessels

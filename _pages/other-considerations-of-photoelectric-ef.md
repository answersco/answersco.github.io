A sharp increase in the probability of photoelectric absorption occurs at energies just above the shell binding energy. The K-shell binding energy of I is 33 keV and 37 keV for Ba. Ba and I are used as contrast agents because they readily absorb x-ray photons in the 35-50 keV range. When an x-ray tube is operated using 65-90 kVp, there are many x-rays produced in the 35-50 keV energy range so the I or Ba strongly absorbs this radiation, producing high contrast in the acquired image. Probability of PE is (Z^3)/(E^3) and as kVP increases the contrast decreases.

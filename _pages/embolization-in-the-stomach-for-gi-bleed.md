title: "Embolization in the stomach for GI bleeding"
---
Rich collateral supply of stomach allows embo with relative impunity.
Identification of bleeding source before embo in the GI tract is generally the rule in order to prevent bowel infarction.

Left gastric artery = exception
-Can be embolized empirically in patients with endoscopically proven fundal or GEJx lesions.
-Use small Gel-foam cubes or large particles (up to 700-900 micrometers) until stasis occurs.

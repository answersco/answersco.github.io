Tc-99m-macroaggregated albumin (MAA) &#8594; perfusion
Particulate that lodges in pulmonary capillary bed 
Most particles are between 10 and 30 &#181;m in size
Typically 3-mCi of Tc-99m MAA is administered&#8594; ~200-600,000 particles
Particle fragments begin to break down in ~ 3 minutes
&#189; dose can be used in the following patients:
Children
Pregnant patients
Patients with mild pulmonary HTN
Patients with known right-to-left shunt
Severe pulmonary HTN&#8594; relative contraindication to MAA because obstruction of even a few pulmonary capillaries could cause clinical worsening.
Right-to-left shunt &#8594; causes immediate brain and renal uptake after IV injection &#8594; could possibly quantify the shunt fraction.
Renal uptake can also be seen if free pertechnetate is present, but evaluation of the head and neck can differentiate free pertechnetate from a right-to-left shunt.
Free pertechnetate is taken up by the thyroid, but not the brain
Right-to-left shunt&#8594; demonstrates immediate brain uptake and no significant uptake in the neck
Clumping of MAA&#8594; can be seen when MAA is inadvertently drawn back into the injection syringe&#8594; coagulation with the patient's blood

Each SE sequence starts with a 90&#176; RF excitation pulse&#8594; tips longitudinal magnetization into transverse magnetization in a selected slice.
Phase and frequency gradient pulses&#8594; used to codify spatial location in a selected slice.
The spins dephase for a short time, TE/2
A 180&#176; RF pulse is then applied, which rephases spins, causing a &quot;spin echo&quot;-180&#176; RF pulse occurs halfway between the 90&#176; RF and the echo.
A &quot;spin&quot; echo occurs when tissue spins rephase at TE.
After a time TR (time of repetition), which allows recovery of the longitudinal magnetization&#8594; the signal is repeated.
The sequence must be repeated to fill each line of k-space.
One row of k-space is filled during each TR.

title: "Fetal hydrops"
---
- cardiovascular anomalies
- chromosomal abnormalities
- infection (TORCH, viral)
= immune hydrops

-Rh sensitization, TORCH, Turners
-pleural effusion
-pericardial effusion
-subcutaneous edema
-thickened placenta

Signs: diffusion, ascites, skin thickening, polyhydramnios.

Immune versus nonimmune (worse prognosis).

Immune: Rh antigen to mom causes Rh antibodies to baby - feel hemolytic anemia.

Nonimmune - fluid overload, most commonly cardiac abnormalities, extra cardiac shunt (i.e. the vein of Galen), infectious (i.e. parvovirus B 19 and torch)

fluid accumulation in 2 spaces: pericardial effusion, ascites, pleural effusion, SQ edema
- Can be due to TORCH infections or Rh sensitization from prior pregnancy
- DONT forget that they could show PLACENTOMEGALY (placenta greater than 4-5 cm) which can be seen

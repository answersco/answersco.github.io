title: "Tardus-parvus wave forms"
---
Tardus: this refers to the upstroke of the arterial wave form and can be measured by acceleration time. A normal acceleration time is &lt; 70 ms. An acceleration time of &gt; 70 ms (or 0.07 sec) corresponds to 50% stenosis of the renal artery. REMEMBER: tardus is ACCELERATION

Parvus: this is a measurement of max systolic VELOCITY and can be measured from end diastole to the peak of the first systolic wave form. T his is measured in ACCELERATION INDEX. An acceleration index of &lt; 3.0 m/sec correlates with &gt; 50% stenosis of the renal artery.

title: "What artifact occurs secondary to excitation of neighboring slices and how do you improve it?"
---
Cross-talk: RF and FT pulses placed close enough together can cause excitation of neighboring sections more than once in a single repetition.
-Leads to partial saturation and lower signal
-All sections (except on the ends) will be subjected to this
-3D images are not susceptible to this because the entire volume undergoes excitation with sections within the volume acquired with gradients.

Improved by: 
-Increasing the gap between sections.
-Interleave slices (all odds, then all evens).

title: "Sodium iodide well counter"
---
Basically a small gamma camera with just one PMT
Sample is placed into a hole in the block of NaI crystal
Gives great efficiency at detection, but can be overwhelmed (dead counts)

Good for in-vitro blood or urine samples
Good for wipe test samples.

Thyroid probe is a modified NaI well counter

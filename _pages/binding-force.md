title: "Binding force"
---
This is the attraction between the proton and the electron
Always think of binding force having a NEGATIVE potential energy, i.e., energy needs to be ADDED to the system in order for an electron to get ejected
Interesting concept: so the CLOSER an electron is to the nucleus, the GREATER the negative potential (more stable electron)
The FURTHER away from the nucleus an electron is the LOWER the negative potential and the more energetic the electron (less stable electron)
Also good to know that binding energy varies with the INDIVIDUAL ELEMENT and the LEVEL of the electron

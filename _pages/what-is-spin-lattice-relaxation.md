title: "What is spin-lattice relaxation"
---
Spin-lattice relaxation = longitudinal relaxation = T1 = recovering of longitudinal magnetization

Return to longitudinal relaxation follows an exponential curve with positive slope approaching 100% over time
T1 = time at which longitudinal magnetization has reached 63# of final value
Each tissue has different T1
Greater field strength = longer T1 (greater net magnetization in stronger field, and take longer to hand energy over to lattice).

title: "Telomerase"
---
-normal, specialized cells have telomerase turned off, limits cell division
-cancer cells turns telomerase back on
-telomeres extend, and releases the brake on rapid cell division

-sperm, eggs, bone marrow, and cancer cells produce this enzyme that prevents shortening of telomeres
-has a six base RNA sequence that adds repeats to telomeres
RNA: AAUCCC AAUCCC
DNA: TTAGGG 
-has reverse transcriptase where it changes RNA to DNA to elongate

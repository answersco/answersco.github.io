a technique embraced by the Quadruple alliance in order to suppress French aggression after the Napoleonic Wars; the international equilibrium of political and military forces that would discourage aggression by any combination of states or, worse, the domination of Europe by any single state. Great Powers used balance of power to create peace at Congress of Vienna.

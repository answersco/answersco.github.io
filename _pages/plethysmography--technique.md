title: "Plethysmography: technique"
---
Volume and photoplethysmography also permit noninvasive examinations for PAD by measuring the global perfusion of the extremity via recording the minute changes in the volume of the extremity that occur throughout the cardiac cycle
Volume plethysmographic recordings (VPRs) and pulse volume recordings (PVRs) are essentially interchangeable.

Series of BP cuffs are applied to the extremity, and sequentially inflated to 60-65 mmHg
Pressure in the cuff changes slightly as the volume of blood changes with systole and diastole- these changes are displayed as a waveform.
Abnormalities in the waveform indicate occlusive disease in the vascular segment proximal to the cuff.

Medial sclerosis doesn't affect plethysmography
Patient motion degrades the study.

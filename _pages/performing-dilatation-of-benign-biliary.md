title: "Performing dilatation of benign biliary stricture"
---
It can occasionally be difficult to determine whether there is some evidence of narrowing at the anastomotic site.
-Biliary manometry is used by some, but this is cumbersome and difficult to interpret.
-Instead, you can place a 10-mm balloon across the anastomosis and inflate the balloon. Presence of stricture is determined by the presence of a waist in the balloon. The balloon is inflated until the waist disappears. The balloon should be inflated for 2-3 minutes and repeated until the waist disappears. Often the waist on a 10-mm balloon is minimal, so a 12-mm balloon can then be used.

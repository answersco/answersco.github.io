title: "Adrenal adenoma"
---
NECT: &lt; 10 HU

CECT:
Absolute washout: (Enhanced - Delayed) / (Enh - Unenhanced) x 100
&gt; 60% = adenoma

Relative washout (Enhanced - Delayed) / Enhanced x 100
&gt; 40% = adenoma

MRI: signal dropout on in-phase to out-of-phase

Most are nonfunctional, but Cushing's (cortisol) and Conn (aldosterone) can present as functional adenoma.

Look for absolute washout &gt; 60%
Look for relative washout &gt; 40%

MRI: look for signal dropout on in/out phase 

Other adenoma factors:
- Normally homogenous 
- Adenomas are usually small 
- Bilateral, small typically going to be an adenoma

Portal venous phase enhancement &gt; 120 think hypervascular met vs pheo

Conn syndrome (excessive aldosteron) most commonly caused by benign adenomas

Scutum
The scutum (yellow arrow) is a sharp bony spur formed by the lateral wall of the tympanic cavity and the superior wall of the external auditory canal.
It is usually the first bony structure to erode as a result of a cholesteatoma, that is formed by medial retraction of the pars flaccida of the tympanic membrane into the epitympanum.
If the retraction continues it will result in ossicular destruction. 
If the cholesteatoma passes posteriorly through the aditus ad antrum into the mastoid itself, erosion of the tegmen mastoideum, with exposure of the dura and erosion of the lateral semicircular canal with deafness and vertigo, may result. 

On the left the most anterior point of the facial nerve is seen (white arrow). 
At this point the nerve makes a U-turn.
It is named the genu or geniculum and represents the geniculate ganglion.
The malleus is seen connected to the tympanic membrane and to the incus.

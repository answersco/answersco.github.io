Low field strength. Use fast spin echo sequences instead of GRE. Increase receiver bandwidth, which will increase noise, so increase number of acquisitions. Artifacts can be directed in the superior inferior plane so that medial and lateral to implant (loosening) can be seen. Decrease voxel size by decreasing slice thickness and increasing matrix size.

1) class IV arrhythmic agent
2) block calcium ion channels 
3) reduce automaticity in SA node
4) slow conduction through AV node
5) slow HR
6) used for supraventricular dysrhythmias bc they prolong the refractory period (the rest time, not willing to accept another signal)
7) decreases workload of the heart

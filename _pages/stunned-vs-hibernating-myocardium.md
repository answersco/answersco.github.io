title: "Stunned vs hibernating myocardium"
---
Stunned = acute situation, resulting from ischemia and reperfusion injury.
-Normal perfusion
-Poor contractility
-Usually improves within a few weeks

Hibernating = chronic, from severe CAD and chronic hypoperfusion
-Areas of decreased perfusion and contractility at stress and rest (like scar)
-But tissue will take up FDG more intensely than normal myocardium, and will demonstrate redistribution of thallium.

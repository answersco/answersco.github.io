Gamma camera: radiotracer exits patient, then goes through collimator, then crystal, then PMT, then computer.

Low energy (1-200 keV): Tc-99m, I-123, Xe-133, Tl-201
-Thinner plates

Medium energy (200-400 keV): Ga-67, In-111

High energy (&gt;400): I-131 (technically most energy peaks are medium). 
-Thicker plates

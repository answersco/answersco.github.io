-Femoral more convenient if no other procedures. Cobra or recurved catheter such as Simmons-1 useful for selecting HVs from femoral approach.
-IJ mechanically more advantageous, with direct line for catheter into the hepatic vein. Multipurpose angled-tip catheter effective in selecting HVs.

RHV: oriented in lateral or slightly posterolateral direction
MHV and LHV: more anterior in orientation

Injection: rate of 5-6 mL/sec for total of 15-18 mL during suspended respiration.

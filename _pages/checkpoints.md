title: "Checkpoints"
---
-these control the cell cycle
-a mutation in a gene that halts or slows the cell cycle can lift the constraint, leading to inappropriate mitosis
-failure to pause in order to repair DNA can allow a mutation in an oncogene or tumor suppressor gene to persist
-mismatch mutations in DNA repair genes and allow other mutations to persist

-ensure that mitotic events occur in the correct sequence
-many types of cancer result from these being faulty
-monitors progression through cell cycle

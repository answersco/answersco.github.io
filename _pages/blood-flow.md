title: "Blood flow"
---
1) Blood enters right atrium from superior or inferior vena cava
2) Blood in right atrium flows through right AV valve into right ventricle
3) Contraction of right ventricles forces pulmonary valve open
4) Blood flows through pulmonary valve into pulmonary trunk
5) Blood is distributed by right and left pulmonary arteries to the lungs where it unloads CO2 and loads O2
6) Blood returns from lungs via pulmonary veins to left atrium
7) Blood in left atrium flows through left AV valve into left ventricle
8) Contraction of left ventricle forces aortic valve open
9) Blood flows through aortic valve into ascending aorta
10) Blood in aorta is distributed to every organ in the body where it unloads O2 and loads CO2
11) Blod returns to right atrium via vena cava

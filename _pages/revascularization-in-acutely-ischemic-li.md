title: "Revascularization in acutely ischemic limb"
---
Revasc of the viable, acutely ischemic limb is almost always indicated
-Thrombectomy with Fogarty balloon catheters through limited CFA or popliteal artery incisions is effective to relieve acute obstruction, especially embolic occlusion.
-When embolectomy is unsuccessful in restoring sufficient flow for limb viability, bypass surgery can be performed.

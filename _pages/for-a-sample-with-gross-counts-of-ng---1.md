title: "For a sample with gross counts of Ng = 1600 and background Nbg = 400, how do you determine the percent standard deviation (%SD) of net counts in the sample?"
---
Net counts = gross counts - background counts = 1200
SD of net counts = SD of gross counts + SD of background counts (square root of Ng + square root of Nbg = 40 + 20 = 60)
% SD of net counts = SD of gross counts / # net counts x 100 = 5%

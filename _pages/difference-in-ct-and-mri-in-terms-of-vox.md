title: "Difference in CT and MRI in terms of voxel size effect on S to N ratio"
---
In MRI, INCREASING voxel size does NOT decrease noise (it doesnt do anything to noise) it just increases SIGNAL
In CT, INCREASING voxel size also INCREASES the amount of noise (proportional to the square root of the unit changes) - still your SNR will improve, just not as much as in MRI

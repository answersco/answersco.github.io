title: "GASTROINTESTINAL: What is most common type of pancreas divisum? what drains what?"
---
Most common is type 1 - no connection between dorsal and ventral ducts

(Type 2 - minor papilla drains whole pancreas and major drains just the bile duct)

(Type 3 - partial fusion but still inadequate)

* in divisum, the Dorsal pancreatic duct (santorini) drains MOST of the pancreas (body and tail) via the MINOR papilla. The ventral (Wirsung) duct drains minor head and uncinate to the MAJOR duct.

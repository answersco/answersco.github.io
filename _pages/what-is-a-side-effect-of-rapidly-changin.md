Eddy Currents:
When magnetic field changes within a space, parasitic currents are induced in any conductor located within that space.
&#8594; these currents (eddy currents) &#8594; create their own magnetic fields that oppose the changes in the original magnetic field.
Eddy currents result in deterioration of MR image quality &#8594; geometric distortion, lack of sharpness, and strange ghosting patterns commonly occur.
Due to the diverse manifestations of eddy currents, they are very difficult to specifically identify&#8594; may explain a sudden deterioration of image quality for no obvious reason.
Method to limit the detrimental effects of eddy currents&#8594; use of actively-shielded MFG coils.

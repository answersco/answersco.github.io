Delayed enhancement: nonischemic&#8594; does not follow a vascular territory
Mid-myocardial delayed enhancement (DE):
Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM): most common nonischemic CM
Idiopathic or secondary to alcohol or drug abuse, or myocarditis
MRI: mid-myocardial DE, diffuse chamber enlargement, and &#8595; ejection fraction.

Sarcoidosis: cardiac manifestations include arrhythmias, LV dysfunction, and restrictive CM.
MRI: typically shows either mid-myocardial or subepicardial DE in a patchy or nodular pattern.

Chagas disease: from protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi
MRI: typically epicardial or mid-myocardial DE, which can be seen even before development of symptoms.
Hypertrophic CM: LV myocardial thickening without dilation, diffuse or focal.
MRI: can be mid-myocardial DE in the regions of hypertrophied myocardium and at the junctions of the interventricular septum and RV free wall. Cine images show &#8595; diastolic filling of the LV.

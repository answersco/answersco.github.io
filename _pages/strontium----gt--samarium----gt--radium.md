title: "Strontium --&gt; Samarium --&gt; Radium - what is best and what kind of decay?"
---
Strontium barely used because bad myelotoxicity

Samarium &quot;good Samaritan&quot; = complexes with hydroxyapatite in high bone turnover and has beta decay (less myelotoxicity)

Radium = the best one; behaves like Ca and is absorbed into bone matrix at sites of active bone mineralization --&gt; emits 4 alpha particles so very little range (less heme toxicity)
- long half life 11.4 days
* Improves survival in prostate mets!

---
-specific and slower
-learned response &amp; always improving
-act after various physical barriers block pathogens
-b cells and antibodies (humoral)
-t cells (cellular)

-requires antigen stimulation &amp; is slow (days)
-diversity - many different pathogens recognized
-specificity - distinguishes particular molecules
-memory - responds faster with subsequent exposure
-includes primary and secondary responses and humoral and cellular immune responses

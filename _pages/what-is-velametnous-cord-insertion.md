title: "What is velametnous cord insertion?"
---
Cord inserts into the fetal membranes OUTSIDE the placental margin and has to travel back through the membranes to the placenta (between the amnion and chorion)

- increased risk IUGR and growth discordance among twins

* If within 2 cm of the placental margin, then it's a &quot;marginal cord insertion&quot;

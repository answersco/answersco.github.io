title: "Imaging appearances of primary TB:"
---
Primary TB: as many as 15% have no XR changes.
4 imaging manifestations (none or all may be present)
Ill-defined consolidation
Pleural effusion
Lymphadenopathy
Miliary disease
May occur in any lobe, most typically lower lobes or RML
Can be difficult to distinguish between primary and post-primary, but both are treated the same.
Classic findings:
Ghon focus: initial focus of parenchymal infection, usually in the upper part of the lower lobe or the lower part of the upper lobe.
Ranke complex: Ghon focus and lymphadenopathy
Cavitation is rare in primary TB, in contrast to reactivation TB
Adenopathy is common in primary TB, typically featuring central low-attenuation and peripheral enhancement, especially in children. Post-primary TB does not feature prominent adenopathy.

title: "Bone uptake: use lacrimal uptake to distinguish"
---
+ lacrimal uptake
-Free Tc (salivary gland, thyroid, gastric): bones really weak
-Gallium: no splenic uptake, + bone uptake
-MIBG can have lacrimal uptake, but no bone uptake. It shouldn't have much renal uptake because you are using for neuroblastoma.

- lacrimal uptake:
-Sulfur colloid: liver = spleen
-In-111-WBC: very hot spleen

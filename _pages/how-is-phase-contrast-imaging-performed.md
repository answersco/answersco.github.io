A plane must be selected that is perpendicular to the path of the flowing blood, ie perpendicular to the outflow tract of a valve. The technique creates a velocity encoded image for multiple phases of the heart cycle, thus creating a cine. In the cine produced, stationary tissue appears gray with tissue moving through the plane appearing as shades of either white or black, depending on the direction. The more white or black the tissue is, the faster it is moving. Software can produces time-velocity and time-flow curves.

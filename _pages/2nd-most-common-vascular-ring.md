Right arch with aberrant left subclavian artery&#8594; 2nd most common vascular ring
The right arch indents the anterior trachea while the aberrant left subclavian artery wraps posteriorly around the esophagus.
Lateral: posterior impression on esophagus, and anterior impression on trachea (same as double aortic arch)
The ligamentum arteriosum completes the ring.
In contrast, the more common variant of left arch with aberrant right subclavian is an asymptomatic normal variant, and not a vascular ring.

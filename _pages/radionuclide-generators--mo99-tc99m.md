99Mo-99mTc (&quot;moly&quot;) generator
A stored quantity of 99Mo decays with a half-life of 65.9 hours &#8594; decays into the radioisotope 99mTc with half-life of 6.02 hours.
Essentially all 99mTc used clinically on a daily basis is obtained from moly generators.
Moly generator is typically purchased weekly &#8594; provides usable amounts of 99mTc each day.
Radionuclide Generators&#8594; follow Parent-Daughter Equilibrium
99Mo-99mTc (&quot;moly&quot;) generator 
Maximal activity of 99mTc is obtained about 23 hours after the previous elution of the generator.
Because of the decay of 99Mo &#8594; the obtainable maximal 99mTc activity decreases with each subsequent day.
After about a week, a moly generator no longer produces sufficient 99mTc to satisfy clinical needs for a day&#8594; the old generator is replaced with a new one.
By federal regulation&#8594; a maximum breakthrough of 0.15 microcuries of 99Mo per millicurie of 99mTc is allowed

title: "Instruments are played in different ways."
---
There are many different types of instruments. Violins and guitars are stringed instruments. Musicians move the strings on these instruments to play them. To play pianos or organs, you press the keys on their keyboards. To play wind instruments, such as a horn or a flute, you blow into them while pressing keys. Musicians play drums, cymbals, and other percussion instruments by striking them.

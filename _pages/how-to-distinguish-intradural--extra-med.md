title: "How to distinguish Intradural, extra medullary Schwannoma vs Neurofibroma?"
---
Schwannoma is most common and usually solitary from dorsal nerve roots (usually ANTERIOR)
- &quot;Dumbbell&quot;; T1 dark, T2 bright, enhancing
* Central necrosis or hemorrhage and mixed solid/cystic favors Schwannoma
* Look for smoothly marginated, enlarged neural foramen (UNLIKE MENINGIOMA)

Neurofibroma = TARGET SIGN (T2 dark center with T2 bright rim); may contain fat and have POSTERIOR vertebral body scalloping

Meningioma = T1 iso, slightly T2 bright, with calcifications and bright, homogeneous enhancement (USUALLY POSTERIOR)
- Look for Dural tail

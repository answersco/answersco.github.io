title: "IR intervention for chronic UE arterial occlusive disease"
---
Most commonly stent placement at subclavian and brachiocephalic origits due to AS plaque
-L subclavian affected more than R subclavian or brachiocephalic.
-Obstruction at ostia of left subclavian is the result of aortic plaque
-Ostial stenosis of R subclavian artery may also involve right CCA origin.
-Subclavian occlusive disease proximal to vertebral artery origin may cause steal.

Subclavian and brachiocephalic intervention can be performed from femoral, brachial, or carotid (for brachiocephalic) access.
-Common balloon sizes: 6-10 mm diameter
-Balloon-expandable stents almost always necessary when arterial ostium is involved.
-Self-expanding stents can be used in more peripheral locations
-Stents should be avoided in the segment of the subclavian artery between the clavicle and 1st rib, as they can be crushed.

Voxel Size: &#8593; voxel size results in linear &#8593; in signal intensity
Assuming a uniform proton density&#8594; the # of excited spins is proportional to the voxel size, and so is the signal intensity.
Signal &#8593; linearly with &#8593; voxel size.
Noise is independent of the voxel volume, and is associated with the coil-related factors.

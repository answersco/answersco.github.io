title: "Contrast injection rates: Arch, abdominal aorta, IVC, mesenteric artery, renal artery, distal artery:"
---
The diameter in mm of a vessel is a rough guide to the injection rate (in cc/sec).
The total volume of contrast injected depends on the intravascular volume of the vascular bed.
Aortogram (arch): 20 for 30 (20 cc/sec for total of 30 cc)
Abdominal aorta: 20 for 20
Inferior vena cavogram: 20 for 30
Mesenteric artery: 5 for 25
Renal artery: 5 for 15
Distal artery: 3 for 12

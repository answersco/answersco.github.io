title: "Fecal incontinence device"
---
-an alternative measure to protect perianal skin from repeated episodes of fecal incontinence is the fecal incontinence device
-this device can be secured via adhesive around the anal opening and attached to gravity drainage, allowing liquid stool to accumulate in a collection bag 
-it is best applied before the perianal area becomes excoriated
-if excoriation is already present, application of a skin barrier prior to applying the pouch can be effective.

-nursing responsibilities include careful regular assessment and documentation of the perianal skin condition and attentive management of the drainage system
-change the pouch at least every 72 hours, or sooner if it is not intact or leakage has occurred
-provide explanations and support to the patient and family members so that they understand the benefits of this system.

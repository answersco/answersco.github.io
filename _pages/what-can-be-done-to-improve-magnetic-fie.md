title: "What can be done to improve magnetic field homogeneity?"
---
Shimming = process of making the magnetic field of the scanner as homogenous as possible

- Passive = Insert small pieces of ferrous metal inside the bore at time of installation; adjust your shim plates after phantom scanned
- Active = before each patient with shim coil and gradient coil - to optimize the field

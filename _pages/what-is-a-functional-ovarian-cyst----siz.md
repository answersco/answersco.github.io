title: "What is a functional ovarian cyst? - size? - does it need further evaluation?"
---
Functioning cysts (follicles) are affected by the menstrual cycle
- usually 25 mm or less
- change/disappear in 6 weeks (if not, it is a non-funtioning cyst)

- simple cysts &gt; 7 may need further evaluation with MR (at risk for torsion)

Requires selective end-hole catheter
Can usually select both IIAs from a single femoral artery access
Contralateral IIA: selected in antegrade fashion with a Cobra 2 or other angled catheter by crossing the aortic bifurcation, usually in conjunction with an angled steerable hydrophilic guidewire.

Ipsilateral IIA: selected from the same femoral artery access with a pull-down technique using a Waltman loop or a Simmons-shaped catheter, or sometimes by antegrade cannulation with an angled catheter.

Posterior oblique is most useful to visualize IIA origin.
Anterior oblique opens up the anterior and posterior division origins.

Gentle manipulation and possibly intra-arterial NG may be required due to tendency of IIA branches to spasm.

Injection rates vary, but are usually 3-5 mL/sec for 2-3 seconds.

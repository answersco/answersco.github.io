title: "What are the 6-tiers of the hierarchical model for technology assessment, and what is the highest level?"
---
Technology assessment: uses 6-tiered hierarchical model of a continuum for efficacy&#8594; helps relate efficacy to technology assessment and outcomes research
Levels:
Level 1: technical efficacy (e.g. image resolution, noise)
Level 2: diagnostic accuracy efficacy (e.g. sensitivity, specificity, AUC, ROC curve)
Level 3: diagnostic thinking efficacy (e.g. % of cases in which imaging is judged as helpful in making a diagnosis)
Level 4: therapeutic efficacy (e.g. % of times imaging is judged helpful in planning patient management, or results in change in treatment plan)
Level 5: patient outcome efficacy (e.g. % of patients that improve with the imaging compared to those without the imaging)
Level 6: societal efficacy (e.g. cost-effectiveness analysis of imaging from a societal perspective).

Key feature: for an imaging test to be efficacious at a higher level, it must be efficacious at lower levels
Effects on patient health and cost-effectiveness (Levels 5 and 6) typically require a randomized controlled trial

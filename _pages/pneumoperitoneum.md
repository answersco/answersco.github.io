&#8226; Air under thin diaphragm
&#8226; See wall of bowel because of air within gut and outside it 
&#8226; Decubitus (right side up) may help - look for air against the solid liver
&#8226; Don't be fooled by colon between liver and diaphragm (Chilaiditi's Syndrome)
o TIP: Look for Haustra on KUB and decubitus

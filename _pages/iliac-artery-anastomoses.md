External iliac-thoracic aorta: the inferior epigastric artery arises from external iliac artery and anastomoses with thoracic aorta via the internal mammary artery
External iliac-internal iliac: the deep circumflex iliac artery arises from the external iliac artery and anastomoses with the posterior division of the internal iliac artery via the iliolumbar artery.
Internal iliac-IMA: the inferior/middle rectal arteries arise from the internal iliac artery (anterior division) and anastomose with the IMA via the superior rectal artery. This pathway is called the path of Winslow (rectal arcade).

title: "MSK findings in SLE, scleroderma, and polymyositis/dermatomyositis:"
---
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) &#8594; joint abnormalities seen in ~90%
Key XR finding: reducible subluxations of the MCPs and PIPs

Scleroderma &#8594; fingertips affected first, with atrophy of the distal soft tissues
Acroosteolysis = resorption of the distal portion of the distal phalanges
Characteristic of scleroderma, especially if there is accompanying calcification
Dystrophic soft tissue and periarticular calcifications are common &#8594; causes tightening and fibrosis of the skin and often leads to joint contractures.

Polymyositis and dermatomyositis &#8594; idiopathic conditions with inflammation of muscle (polymyositis) or muscle and skin (dermatomyositis)
Joint abnormalities are rare, though they may show periarticular osteopenia
Imaging hallmark: soft-tissue calcification.
Intramuscular calcification is most common, though subcutaneous calcification may also be seen, as in scleroderma.

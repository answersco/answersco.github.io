Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) &#8594; cyanotic CHD with &#8593; pulmonary vascularity &#8594; most common cause of cyanotic heart disease in infants
ASD, VSD, PDA, or combination of left-to-right shunts required for life
US: TGA usually inapparent on four-chamber view
Aorta shown anterior to the heart, and great vessels exit the heart in parallel (rather than crossing in normal fashion)
CXR: classic findings are &quot;egg-on-a-string&quot; appearance to the heart with a narrow mediastinal waist (via configuration of great vessels and thymic involution from stress), lack of main PA bulge, and parallel course of aorta and PA.
More commonly seen is slightly narrow mediastinum and increased pulmonary vasculature.
Right sided arch in 5%.

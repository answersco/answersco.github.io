title: "Indications for performing external biliary drainage and catheter selection"
---
-Patient with septicemic shock due to cholangitis, in whom the minimum intervention necessary to drain the patient is appropriate.
-Patient with a BD stricture or transection at lap chole. External drainage helps temporize patient before definitive surgery.

-Catheter needs to have a relatively small pigtail with relatively large side-holes to promote biliary drainage.
-5 or 7-Fr angiographic pigtail catheter is not appropriate because it doesn't drain well and tends to fall out.
-8-Fr locking pigtail catheter designed for perc chole is often useful.

Rutherford classification: clinically categories chronic limb ischemia
Category 0: asymptomatic
Category 1: mild claudication
Categories 2-3: moderate to severe ischemia
Category 4: ischemic rest pain
Categories 5-6: minor or moderate tissue loss, respectively
Ankle-brachial index (ABI): ratio of SBP in ankles compared to that in the arms
ankle SBP/brachial SBP
&#8595; ABI: suggests hemodynamically significant stenosis between the great vessels and the ankles, since the ankle BP is &lt; the upper extremity BP
ABI &lt; 0.9 is abnormal
ABI between 0.5 and 0.9: usually correlates with intermittent claudication
ABI &lt; 0.4: rest pain is usually present.
Pulse-volume recordings characterize the Doppler waveform at multiple levels
Anatomic location of a lesion can be deduced by the change from a normal triphasic waveform to a biphasic (moderate stenosis) or flat (severe stenosis/occlusion) waveform.

Temperature rises are most likely to occur at bone surfaces and adjacent soft tissues- baby with increasing mineralization (2nd and 3rd trimester) has theoretical risk of heating sensitive tissues such as brain or SC.

1st trimester recommendations:
-Pulsed dopper (spectral, color, and power) should not be routinely used.
-Keep TI under 0.7-1.0

TI:
Below 0.7 for OB imaging
Between 1.0-1.5 should not exceed 30 minutes
Between 2.5-3 should not exceed 1 min
&gt; 3.0 should not be used

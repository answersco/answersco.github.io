Urinomas, hematomas, and lymphoceles all cause photopenic areas on blood pool imaging

Urinoma: usually 1st 2 weeks post-op
Delayed imaging: shows tracer between the bladder and transplanted kidney. 
Hematoma will not have tracer in it.

Lymphocele: usually 4-8 weeks post-op
-Looks like a photopenic area on scan
-Can get large and cause mass effect, otherwise incidental.

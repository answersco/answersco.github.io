title: "IR treatment of acute PE"
---
Catheter-directed techniques are an alternative to systemic thrombolysis and surgical thromboembolectomy in patients with massive PE.
Outcomes similar to those with surgery.
Commonly includes mechanical techniques combined with thrombolytic agents (e.g. 5-10 mg tPA) delivered into the thrombus.
Subsequent catheter infusion of a thrombolytic agent directly into PAs can be continued.

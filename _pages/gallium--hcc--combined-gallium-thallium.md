Focal gallium uptake in liver suggests HCC, while HCC is extremely unlikely if uptake is diminished.

Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is thallium avid, but does not take up gallium. (KaT: Kaposi Thallium Avid)
TB/atypical mycobacteria: take up gallium, but not thallium. (TuG: TB is Gallium avid)
Lymphoma takes up gallium and thallium (Lymphoma likes both).

title: "Renal angiography: technique for selective renal angiography"
---
Basic choices for selective catheters include curved selective catheter such as Cobra-2, Rosch Celiac, or a recurved catheter such as a Sos selective.
-Curved catheter shape chosen when renal artery arises at close to 90-degree angle from aorta
-Recurved catheter can be used to pull down into a renal artery that arises at an acute angle.

Radial or brachial approach used to select a renal artery when there is a steep angle of origine, severe infrarenal aortic tortuosity, or aortoiliac occlusion.

Injection rates of 5-6 mL/sec for 2-3 seconds provide excellent opacification of intrarenal branches.

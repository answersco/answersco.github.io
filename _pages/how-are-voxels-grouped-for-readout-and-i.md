Voxels&#8594; grouped into ensembles
Ensemble&#8594; helps disentangle the location of moments.
Instead of detecting signal from each pixel separately, MRI uses locations paired into ensembles.
Encoding (phase and frequency)&#8594; sets up spatial variations of phase that act like ensembles.
Signal from one set of ensembles = one data point in k-space&#8594; many ensembles are required to fill k-space and construct a full image.
Using ensembles to create an image is more time-efficient than exciting each voxel separately.
During each readout, signal from many different pairs of ensembles is detected sequentially.

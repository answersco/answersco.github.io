title: "MRI myocardial perfusion: stunned vs hibernating"
---
Stunned myocardium: has normal perfusion, abnormal function, and absence of delayed enhancement
Represents transient myocardial dysfunction after a bout of acute ischemia with restoration of blood flow

Hibernating myocardium: poor function, low resting perfusion, and absence of delayed enhancement
Represents chronic ischemia with down-regulated metabolic needs

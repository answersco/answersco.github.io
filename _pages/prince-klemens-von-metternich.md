---
Austrian foreign minister from 1809-1848. Associated with political conservatism and opposed by liberals of the time because he defended traditional monarchy. He had a negative view on human nature (confirmed by FR), and believed that democracy allowed its disorganized elements to grow. He promoted authoritarianism and opposed anticlericalism, believing in the protection of Christian morality.

title: "What pediatric posterior fossa mass is classically hyperdense on NECT?"
---
Medulloblastoma: also usually intermediate T2 signal (classically isointense to gray matter) due to hypercellularity, which may also cause restricted diffuse.
Peak age of 6-11.

ATRT: follows medulloblastoma imaging features, but usually in children &lt; 3 and off-midline location. 40% are supratentorial.

Ependymoma: classically from floor of 4th ventricle. More likely to contain foci of hemorrhage or calcification than other pediatric 4th ventricle neoplasms, and usually no restricted diffusion. Peak age of 1-5 years.

(choroid plexus papillomas are hyperenhancing masses that may occur in 4th ventricle in adults, but are more commonly located in the lateral ventricular atria in children)

---
Pachygyria is a incomplete lissencephaly. Broad, thick gyri with shallow sulci. Normal interdigitating fingers of subcortical white matter are absent. Polymicrogyria is a cortical dysplasia. Thick mantle of gray matter with multiple small gyri. Normal interdigitating fingers of subcortical white matter are absent. Underlying white matter gliosis in polymicrogyria can sometimes help differentiate it from pachygyria.

title: "What is the imaging protocol for In-111 WBC? Timing, photopeaks, collimation, and use of Tc-99m WBC or Tc-99m sulfur colloid."
---
1) Images 1-4 hrs after for IBD and 24 hrs after inj for general imaging.
2) 173 and 247 keV for In-111
3) medium energy collimator
4) Tc-99m may be preferable for IBD and sulfur colloid is useful for BM involvement.

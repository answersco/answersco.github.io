title: "What are the cause and effect of US side-lobe artifact?"
---
Side-lobe artifact in US: result of the radial expansion of piezoelectric crystals
Can result in off-axis US echoes and potential misplacement of echo signal
Misplacement of echo signal may manifest as unexpected echoes within a structure expected to be completely anechoic, such as the gallbladder.
Side-lobe artifact most commonly affects linear transducers

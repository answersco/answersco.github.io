Goal: create unobstructed outflow tract from the systemic ventricle.

Creation of unobstructed flow:
The tiny native aorta is augmented with graft or other methods (neo-aorta).
Aorta is anastomosed to the pulmonary trunk.
ASD is enlarged to create non-restrictive atrial flow.

Maintain pulmonary blood flow:
Blaylock-Taussig Shunt: between R subclavian and right PA 
Or Sano shunt: instead of BTS, uses a conduit to connect the RV to the PA. Disadvantage: steal phenomenon (directed to low-pressure pulmonary system.

Ductus removed to prevent over-shunting to the lungs.

Goal: 
- create unobstructed outflow tract from the systemic ventricle.

1) Creation of unobstructed flow:
- The tiny native aorta is augmented with graft or other methods (neo-aorta)
- Aorta is anastomosed to the pulmonary trunk
- ASD is enlarged to create non-restrictive atrial flow

2) Maintain pulmonary blood flow:
-Blaylock-Taussig Shunt: between R subclavian and right PA 
- Or Sano shunt: instead of BTS, uses a conduit to connect the RV to the PA. 

Disadvantage of BT shunt: steal phenomenon (directed to low-pressure pulmonary system.

Goes bad: over-shunting to the lungs --&gt; pulmonary edema

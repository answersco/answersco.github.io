title: "Cardiovascular impact on immobility of function"
---
1) increased cardiac workload: laying in bed makes the heart work harder bc blood flow is decreased bc your heart has to compensate for all the body systems that are not helping the heart circulate blood effectively
2) orthostatic hypotension
3) thrombus formation and embolism: when blood pools in the extremities bc it is not effectively being pushed back into circulation as well, why TED house and SCDs are used bc they put pressure on the legs to move blood around

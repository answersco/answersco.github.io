title: "Hypothenar Hammer"
---
Blunt trauma like jack hammer
Look for 
- Damage to the ulnar artery (due to hook of hamate) - can be occluded or have pseudoaneurysms

Remember this injures the SUPERFICIAL PALMAR arch - predominately supplied by the ulnar artery
(Makes sense that this affects the superficial arch as it is CLOSER to the force)
- Corkscrew configuration of the superficial palmar arch

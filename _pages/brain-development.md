Remember, adult and child brain are basically reveresed in their signal characteristics

How to remember:
- very early myelin has a HIGH water content therefore appearing T2 bright ,ie., the WHITE matter of a child has HIGH T2 signal 
- As myelin matures, it is going to increase in its fat content and glycolipid content therefore becoming more bright on T1

IMPORTANT:

The change to adult T1 pattern happens FIRST at age 1
The change to adult T2 patterns happens SECOND at age 2

Subcorical white matter is the LAST part of the brian to myelinate 

Brain stem and posterior limb of the internal capsule are normally myelinated

IMPORTANT POINT:

The corpus collosum forms from the FRONT to the BACK although the ROSTRUM is LAST
Significant point is that if you have corpus collosal hypoplasia it is usually the splenium

-Baby T1 pattern looks like adult T2 (flipped)
-Age 1: adult T1 pattern
-Age 2: adult T2 pattern

title: "Hemimegalencephaly and mimic"
---
Hemimegalencephaly: enlargement of all or parts of one cerebral hemisphere
Affected hemisphere may have focal or diffuse neuronal migration defects, including areas of polymicrogyria, pachygyria, and heterotopia.

Big side + big ventricle = hemimegalencephaly
Small side + big ventricle = atrophy (as may be seen in Rasmussen's encephalitis)

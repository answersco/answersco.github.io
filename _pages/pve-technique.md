-Transhepatic access through one of the segments to be reomved reduces risk of damage to FLR.
-US-guided access to a peripheral PV segment, followed by placement of a 5-Fr sheath.
-Portal venogram and pressures obtained.
-Portal vein segments are then selectively catheterized, with recurved catheters useful to select PV branches on same side as the access.
-The entire portion of the liver to be removed should be embolized.
-Embolic agents include small particles, glue, gelatin sponges, alcohol, and coils.
-Goal is peripheral occlusion- when particles are used, size should be 100-200 um, followed by coils in larger segmental vessels (arteries?).
-At end of procedure, coils are placed in the portal branch through which access was obtained, and coils or gelatin sponges are used to occlude parenchymal tract.

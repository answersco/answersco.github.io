title: "Relative Intensity"
---
This is going to be measured in dB
A change of 10 in the dB scale corresponds to a change of an orders o magnitude (10x)

Reducing sound intensity to 10% is -10 dB
Reducing sound intensity to 1 % is -20 dB
Reducing sound intensity to .1% is -30 dB

A loss of - 3dB = 50% decrease in signal intensity

Tissue thickness that reduces ultrasound intensity 3dB is the half value thickness

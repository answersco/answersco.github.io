title: "Cardiac thrombus"
---
Cardiac thrombi: usually secondary to atrial fibrillation or LV dysfunction &#8594; at risk for embolizing
GRE: low signal intensity relative to myocardium due to paramagnetic effects
Fresh thrombus: may show high signal (also on T1)
Chronic thrombus is usually hypointense on both T1 and T2 (tumors usually hyperintense to myocardium)
Acute thrombus may show high signal on both T1 and T2.
Unlike tumor, thrombus shouldn't enhance (except uncommonly in chronic thrombi)

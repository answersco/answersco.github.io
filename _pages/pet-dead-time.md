title: "PET Dead time"
---
This is the time it takes the system to determine the spatial position of an event and the energy of the even and the coincidence processing. While all of these thing are happening, events triggered on the crystal will not be recorded by a photomultiplier tube that is currently working on the above process.

You can DECREASE dead time by INCREASING the number of photomultiplier tubes or you can use a crystal with a faster scintillation time

title: "Collateral paths for obstruction of CFV and EIV"
---
Deep venous system of LE provides collateral drainage for superficial veins and vice versa. Drainage afforded by just one system is frequently sufficient to avoid swelling and discomfort in a prolonged upright posture.

Obstruction of CFV and EIV: results in drainage through the PFVs to the IIVs via gluteal or other pelvic veins.
-Also, drainage through the ipsilateral abdominal wall veins and across the perineum to the contralateral CFV can occur.

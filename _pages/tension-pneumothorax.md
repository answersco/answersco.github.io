What is your diagnosis?

&#8226; Displaces mediastinum away from side of pneumothorax
&#8226; Collapses lung - one or more segments
&#8226; Depresses diaphragm on involved side
&#8226; May invert diaphragm
&#8226; Often see hypotension as blood return to right heart is decreased due to pressure in pleural space exceeding venous pressure in cava.

title: "Compton scatter in tissue:"
---
More prevalent in lower Z materials (e.g. water and tissue), and for kV values &gt;50 kVp.
Dominates at &gt; 25 keV in soft tissue and &gt; 40 keV in bone
Probability proportional to (Electron density) / E
In water, Compton dominates over photoelectric effect at x-ray energies = 30 keV

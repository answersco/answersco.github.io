title: "Management of FEA, ADH, LCIS:"

Some recommend excisional biopsy after biopsy shows FEA (flat epithelial atypia)
Biopsy showing ADH is followed by surgical excision.
High risk lesions in lobular hyperplasia spectrum (ALH, LCIS) are not treated with excision, though they do represent an increased overall risk of developing breast cancer (in either breast) rather than a precursor to carcinoma.

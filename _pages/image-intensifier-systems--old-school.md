Brightness Gain: this refers to the brightness gain that you have from the OUTPUT phosphor relative to what you actually have entering the INPUT phosphor
&#8212;Brightness gain is related to ELECTRODE AMPLIFICATION (FLUX GAIN) and MINIFICATION GAIN...it actually is as follows brightness gain = (flux gain) x (minification gain)
Conversion gain = measure of efficiency of an II which basically = brightness gain
&#8212;NOTE: the older the system, the LESS brightness gain the system can do. Consequence = MORE dose is needed to get the same output brightness as the machine ages.

How to fix the degradation of brightness gain over time:
1. Use a LARGE aperture. Consequence = increases image noise
2. Let automatic brightness control increase dose. Consequence = increased dose
3. Buy a new system

General rule of thumb is once the conversion falls &gt;/= 50% then it's time to replace

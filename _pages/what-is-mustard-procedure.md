title: "What is Mustard Procedure?"
---
Atrial switch procedures (Senning &amp; Mustard) used to correct Transposition by creating a baffle (e.g. &quot;conduit/tunnel&quot;) within the atria to swtich back blood flow at level of in-flow
- RV becomes systemic &amp; LV becomes pump to the lungs

* Mustard = uses extrinsic material as the baffle (unlike Senning) &quot;mustard is a foreign body&quot;

Research Activities!

The use of a drug or device in a manner that does not conform to the FDA-approved labeling is referred to as &quot;off-label&quot; use. This could mean use for a different diagnosis, by a different route of administration, in a different dosing regimen, or in a different patient population (many drugs, for example, are not approved for use in pediatric patients). As a result, a physician is free to use a drug or device for any purpose he/she feels is appropriate or necessary for patient care. &quot;Off-label&quot; use, however, does not apply to research activities.

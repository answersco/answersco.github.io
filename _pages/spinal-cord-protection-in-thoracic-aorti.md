Lumbar CSF drain- important adjunct for repair, especially when distal aorta is treated.
-Should be placed before procedure, and usually remains in place for 24-48 hours.
-Spinal drainage (pressures &lt; 10 mmHg) and maintenance of mean arterial pressure &gt; 90 mmHg dramatically decrease risk of spinal cord ischemia
-Patients in whom acute cord ischemia develops after endograft placement should have urgent placement of lumbar drain.

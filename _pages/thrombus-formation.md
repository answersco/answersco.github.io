title: "Thrombus formation"
---
-formation of clot in artery or vein
-high risk at developing clot if on bedrest or not as mobile as usual bc blood is pooling and usually in the legs - due to decreased venous return
-big indicator is if both legs are affected then it probably is not a blood clot
-need to treat blood clot in leg bc it can travel to the heart or lungs
-as the clot starts travelling, the vessels get narrower and as it becomes narrower you will eventually get an occlusion meaning less blood to brain and heart
-can put in an IVC filter in the artery or vein so it catches the clot if it gets dislodged

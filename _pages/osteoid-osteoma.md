title: "Osteoid Osteoma"
---
Look for lucent nidus surround by dense sclerosis
Classic history is going to be pain in 10-25ish yo that is relieved by aspirin
Common locations: femoral neck (metadiaphysis of long bones) &gt; posterior elements of spine . Fingers are also common but apparently not frequently shown on multiple choice test

Findings:

MRI: LOTS of edema within the adjacent bone and even can be within the soft tissue (much more than expected given the size of the lesion )
Tc-MDP bone scan: Double density. Extremely hot in the center with less uptake peripherally 

Associations: 
- can be associated with scoliosis with the CONVEX portion of the spine pointing away from the lesion

title: "Osteoid Osteoma"
---
Look for lucent nidus surround by dense sclerosis
Classic history is going to be pain in 10-25ish yo that is relieved by aspirin
Common locations: femoral neck (metadiaphysis of long bones) &gt; posterior elements of spine . Fingers are also common but apparently not frequently shown on multiple choice test

Findings:

MRI: LOTS of edema within the adjacent bone and even can be within the soft tissue (much more than expected given the size of the lesion )
Tc-MDP bone scan: Double density. Extremely hot in the center with less uptake peripherally 

Associations: 
- can be associated with scoliosis with the CONVEX portion of the spine pointing away from the lesion

Painful sclerotic cortical lesion with lucent centered nidus. Occurs in patients younger than 30. Nidus is surgically removed or thermally ablated. May mimic osteomyelitis. Bone scan double-density sign versus photopenic area for osteomyelitis. Long bones or posterior elements of spine.

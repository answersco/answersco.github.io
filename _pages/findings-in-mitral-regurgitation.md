Mitral regurgitation:
Acute MR secondary to MI: can present as acute pulmonary edema with a normal-sized heart.
Chronic MR: can lead to enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and LA enlargement.
The LAA is often enlarged in patients with rheumatic disease, but is typically not enlarged in nonrheumatic MR.

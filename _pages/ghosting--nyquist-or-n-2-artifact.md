title: "Ghosting, Nyquist or N/2 artifact?"
---
Appearance: Nyquist ghost appears as an image copy or multiple copies with decreased intensity that is shifted from the center of the field of view usually by 1/2 the FOV.
Cause: errors in phase between readouts, due to imperfections in gradient performance. Ghosts are particularly common in EPI images due to the strong demand on gradient speed and performance.
Direction: phase-encode direction

title: "How to distinguish epidermoid cyst from arachnoid cyst (both are possibly CPA lesions!)?"
---
Epidermoid = Restricts DWI; possibly BRIGHT FLAIR

Arachnoid cyst = follows CSF on all; and does NOT restrict (dark on FLAIR)

Dermoid = behaves like fat (more likely midline in the suprasellar cistern; 4x LESS common than epidermoid)

Think of Epidermoid as behaving like CSF and Dermoid behaving like FAT

- Dermoids are more often midline and suprasellar cistern (T1 bright) 

- Epidermoid more often OFF midline

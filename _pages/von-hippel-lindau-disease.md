40% RCC. 75% simple renal cysts. Hemangioblastomas CNS. Retinal angiomas. Pancreatic cysts. Pancreatic neoplasms. 50-80% Pheochromocytomas (multiple, bilateral, extraadrenal).

Lesions can include hemangioblastomas (which favor posterior aspects of the cerebellum, medulla, and spinal cord), angiomas of retina, endolymphatic sac tumors of the inner ear, renal cysts, renal clear cell carcinoma, pancreatic cysts, pancreatic islet cell tumors, pheochromocytomas, and epididymal cysts/cystadenomas.

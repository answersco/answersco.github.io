Effectiveness: a measure of the accuracy or success of a diagnostic or therapeutic technique when carried out in an average clinical environment.
In &quot;real world&quot; settings, there is generally much more variability in techniques and therapies are often less effective than demonstrated in clinical trials.
Assessing effectiveness can sometimes be accomplished by studying secondary data.

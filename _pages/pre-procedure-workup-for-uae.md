Young patients who desire future pregnancy should be counseled that there can be 2-3% incidence of premature menopause following the procedure. 
Fertility goals should be discussed and documented in that embo of one or both ovarian arteries is necessary in up to 5% to devascularize fibroids.
Should have pelvic exam, endometrial biopsy (if bleeding between periods- metrorrhagia), PAP smear within 12 months, and either US or MRI.
GnRH analogues should be stopped for several weeks before procedure if possible.

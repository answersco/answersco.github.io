title: "FMD in iliac arteries"
---
Iliac arteries are 3rd most common location for FMD
Typical patient is female, but older than those that present with renal artery FMD, prob because this is usually an incidental finding at angio for other reasons.

Can present with occlusive symptoms or less commonly spontaneous dissection. 
Occlusive symptoms respond well to angioplasty, and dissection can be treated by stent placement.

---
A cystic midline (or near-midline) mass that is intimate with the strap muscles is almost always a thyroglossal duct cyst. The complex relationship with the hyoid bone is also characteristic.

Thyroglossal duct cyst&#8594; most present as enlarging neck mass that elevates with tongue protrusion.
65% are infrahyoid, 35% at or above hyoid
Most TDCs are midline, but infrahyoid TDC more commonly slightly off midline.
Rare complication of papillary thyroid carcinoma.

Typically a midline cystic mass that can be anywhere from the foramen cecum to the thyroid gland
Normally these things are located at or above the hyoid bone

midline cystic mass at the level of the hyoid
Next dx step: look for normal thyroid with ultrasound +/- Tc-MIBI or I-123
Fact: Enhancing nodule within cyst = CANCER, usually papillary
Fact: These cysts can get infected

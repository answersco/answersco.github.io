title: "Generally speaking, how do you tell the difference between infection and loosening of a prosthesis on bone scan"

Infection: diffuse increased activity along the prosthesis

Loosening: more focal along the stem and lesser trochanter

- Combined Tc-sulfur colloid and WBC imaging is really needed to tell the difference

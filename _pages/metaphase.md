title: "Metaphase"

-centrioles move toward poles of cell
-chromosomes (still sister chromatids) line up on the cell's equator
-spindle microtubules attach to centromeres of the duplicated chromosome

-chromosomes lie along midline of cell
-fibers of aster attach to plasma membrane

the second phase of mitosis in which the chromosomes line up across the center of the cell and become attached to the spindles via microtubules

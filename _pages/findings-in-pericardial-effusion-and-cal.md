title: "Findings in pericardial effusion and calcification:"
---
Pericardial effusion: as little as 100-200 mL of fluid can impede diastolic filling if it accumulates quickly
Classic XR finding: oreo cookie sign&#8594; represents the parallel lucent epicardial and pericardial fat stripes (cookies) and the radiopaque pericardial effusion (white filling)

Pericardial calcification: can be a result of prior pericarditis, most commonly viral or uremic in origin.
Can be associated with constrictive physiology.
Main differential is myocardial calcification due to old infarct.

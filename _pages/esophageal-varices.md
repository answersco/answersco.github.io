Varices: can usually be distinguished from solid mass by change in size and shape with peristalsis, though thrombosed varices can mimic tumor
Uphill varices: due to portal HTN&#8594; affect distal esophagus
Blood flows uphill from portal vein&#8594; left gastric (coronary vein) &#8594; periesophageal venous plexus&#8594; azygos/hemiazygos collaterals&#8594; SVC
Downhill varices: rare, due to SVC obstruction&#8594; proximal esophagus
Enlarged collateral vessels include the supreme intercostal veins (drain 1st intercostal space), bronchial veins, and inferior thyroidal veins.

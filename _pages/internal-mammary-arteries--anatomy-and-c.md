title: "Internal mammary arteries- anatomy and collateral supply"
---
Internal mammary arteries: constant vessels that arise from anterior inferior aspect of subclavian arteries just opposite or slightly distal to vertebrals.

Potential sources of collateral blood supply:
-Thoracic aortic obstruction- via anterior anastomoses with intercostal arteries
-Abdominal aortic obstruction-inferior epigastric arteries
-Can also provide collateral supply to bronchial arteries.

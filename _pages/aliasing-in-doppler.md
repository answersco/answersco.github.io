title: "Aliasing in Doppler"
---
Super high velocities are displayed as low (negative)
On spectral, it looks like the spectrum is cut off and wrapped around the baseline, appearing on opposite end.
Occurs when the doppler shift is &gt; than the Nyquist frequency 
Nyquist limit (kHz) = 1/2 x pulse repetition frequency (PRF)

Reduced or eliminated by:
-Decreasing Doppler shift- via using lower frequency transducer or using doppler angle closer to 90.
-Increasing the PRF (increasing Nyquist) or selecting a sample volume at a lesser depth or increasing the scale.

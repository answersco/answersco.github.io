title: "For US of the thyroid compared to US of the liver, how will the frequency of the transducer change?"
---
Frequency for imaging the thyroid will be higher.
The thyroid is a superficial organ and thus requires less depth of penetration. Because there is an inversely proportional relationship between frequency and depth (f = v/wavelength), the thyroid would require a much higher frequency and smaller wavelength in order to be imaged.

title: "Transient osteoporosis of the hip"
---
Can happen in pregnancy women in 3rd trimester
Also is common in men in a bilateral fashion

Findings:

- Subchondral cortical loss of the femoral head is nearly pathognomonic (basically you are looking for super lucent bones)

Think pregnant woman in 3rd trimester with left hip pain. See osteopenia on radiograph, edema on MRI, hot on bone scan.

Painful hip osteoporosis and no other finding. Self-limited with full resolution.

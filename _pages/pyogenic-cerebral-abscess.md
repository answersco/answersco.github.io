Pyogenic abscess: early cerebritis&#8594; late cerebritis&#8594; early abscess&#8594; late abscess
Early stage of infection&#8594; nonspecific T2 prolongation in affected region with heterogeneous enhancement.
Proceeds to ring-enhancing mass, with a T2-hypointense rim.
Unlike the rim of a glioma or metastasis, an abscess rim is thin and smooth.
When periventricular in location, an abscess classically tends to feature a thinner capsule oriented toward the ventricles.
Almost always demonstrates restricted diffusion.

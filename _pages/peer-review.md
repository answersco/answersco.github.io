title: "Peer review"
---
Peer Review: a radiology quality and safety process in which a random sample (often 5-10% of work done by a radiologist) is evaluated by a peer with comparable clinical credentialing
Peer review programs: designed to maintain standards of quality, to improve radiologists' performance, and to provide credibility to oversight organizations (e.g. JC)
Feedback is typically provided to the original radiologist
In situations where fair and unbiased peer review is not possible, an external peer review is warranted.
The &quot;standard&quot; for peer review is peer consensus (rather than pathological proof) &#8594; cases flagged in peer review are thus considered to be discrepant, and are not classified as errors per se.
ACR: created simplified system named RadPeer
Works by scoring a prior exam using a standardized 4-point rating scale, which also assesses whether or not there is a clinically significant finding.

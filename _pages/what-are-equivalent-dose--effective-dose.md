Equivalent dose: product of dose and the radiation weighting factor (Wr), a factor designed to reduce all radiation to a common scale. The unit is the sievert. 
Effective dose: sum
of the products of equivalent dose and the tissue weighting factor (Wt ) for all organs or tissues exposed
Committed Equivalent dose: dosimetric term used when the source of radiation exposure is from radioactive mate- rial located within the body

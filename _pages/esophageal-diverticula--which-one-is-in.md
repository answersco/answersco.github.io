title: "Esophageal diverticula: which one is in the hypopharynx, which one is associated with the cricopharyngeus, which one is associated with scarring, and which one is just above the diaphragm?"
---
Zenker's = posterior (Z is in back of alphabet)
Site of weakness = Killian dehiscence or triangle
Occurs in hypopharynx (above level of hypopharynx)

Killian-Jamieson = anterior and lateral
In cervical esophagus
Protrudes through area of weakness below the attachment of the cricopharyngeus.

Traction diverticulum: mid-esophageal, often triangular in shape
Occur from scarring (OGD or TB)
Will empty

Epiphrenic diverticula: just above the diaphragm (usually on the right, vs. para-esophageal hernia usually on left)
Pulsion-type
Will not empty (no muscle in their walls)

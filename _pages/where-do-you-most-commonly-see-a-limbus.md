title: "Where do you most commonly see a limbus vertebra?"
---
Limbus vertebra is a well-corticated osseous density, usually of the anterosuperior vertebral body corner, that occurs secondary to herniation of the nucleus pulposus through the the vertebral body endplate beneath the ring apophysis (see ossification of the vertebrae).

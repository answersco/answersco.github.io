title: "Endometrioma:"
---
Rounded mass with homogeneously low level internal echoes (lacy fishnet in hemorrhagic cyst) and increased through transmission, possibly fluid-fluid levels and internal septations.
The more unusual or varied the echogenicity and the more ovoid or irregular the shape, the more likely it's an endometrioma.
Do not change on follow-up imaging (unlike hemorrhagic cyst)
30% with small echogenic foci adhering to the walls.
1% undergo malignant transformation to endometrioid or clear cell carcinoma&#8594; risk factors include age &gt; 45 and size &gt; 6-9 cm.

Enhancing mural nodule: can be seen with decidualized endometrioma in pregnancy, but if not pregnant it is a sign of malignancy.

MRI: 
T1 bright (from blood), with no signal drop on FS (unlike teratoma)
T2 dark (iron) with shading sign

Classic findings on ultrasound are homogenous HYPOechogenicity with INCREASE through transmission 
MRI: These things many times are HYPERintense on T1 imaging due to blood products (although in the acute phase they can be HYPOintese)
&#8212;Important distinguisher from mature teratoma is that teratoma will lose signal on FAT SUPRESSED imaging whereas an endometriom WILL NOT (this makes sense as it means the endometrioma contains BLOOD and the teratoma contains macroscopic fat)

See image of T1 FAT SAT - see how the endometrioma still HAS signal

title: "Dose in IR"
---
50% of dose delivered in the superficial 3-5 cm of skin/fat
The depth of this 50% depends on kVp and filtration (higher kVp + copper filtration = more penetration)
For body (or part) measuring &lt; 10 cm, grid should be off
Thicker patient gets higher skin dose due to ABC compensation (less penetration &#8594; higher kVp)
Lateral view doubles dose to patient and operator
Typical dose of ~0.3-0.5 mGy per frame at the entrance skin position (10-20x higher per image than regular fluoro)
Total dose = (dose per frame) x (frame rate) x (duration x # of runs)

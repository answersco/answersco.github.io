title: "What is the general premise of magnetization transfer contrast?"
---
Protein-bound water has short T2 so not seen on MRI.
- A narrow band RF pulse (shifted slightly away from water's Larmor resonance) selectively saturates protein bound water. As the mobile protons exchange with free water protons you get &quot;partially saturated free water&quot; which is lower signal on subsequent images (thus creating contrast)
- More signal loss = higher protein content
- ex) Multiple sclerosis in brain
- ex) to reduce background signal in MRA

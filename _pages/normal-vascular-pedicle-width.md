title: "Normal vascular pedicle width?"
---
Less than 58 mm

Vascular pedicle: transverse width of the upper mediastinum
Right border: interface of SVC and RMSB
Left border: lateral border of the takeoff of the subclavian from the aorta
Normal vascular pedicle width: &gt; 58 mm. 
&gt; 63 mm and &gt; 70 mm have both been proposed as cutoffs for supine XR and correlate with increased PCWP (&gt; 18 mmHg) and fluid overload

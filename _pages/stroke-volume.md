title: "Stroke volume"
---
amount of blood ejected from the left ventricle with each contraction

-the amount of blood that is ejected by the left ventricle with one contraction
-includes preload, afterload, and contractility

-the other factor in cardiac output
-governed by preload, contractility, and afterload
EX. 
-increased preload or contractility increases stroke volumes
-increased afterload decreased stroke volume

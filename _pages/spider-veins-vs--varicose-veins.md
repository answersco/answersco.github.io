title: "Spider veins vs. varicose veins"
---
Telangiectasias and reticular (&quot;spider&quot;) veins: due to incompetent small perforator veins, resulting in dilatation of the subdermal venous network.
-Telangiectasias: flat, red blemishes that blanch on pressure with slow return of color.
-When the return of color is brisk or lesion is pulsatile, AVM should be suspected
-Reticular veins: small, superficial, thin-walled veins close to skin surface

Varicose veins: dilated, tortuous, superficial veins that distend when patient is upright, causing aching. Can thrombose (superficial thrombophlebitis) or rarely rupture.

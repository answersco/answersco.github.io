SPECT/CT Quality Control &#8594; requires the same procedures needed for SPECT
Daily calibration checks &#8594; should verify that the machine is reporting attenuation coefficients correctly to within + 5 HU
Uniformity check&#8594; should verify that CT uniformity shows 0% contrast to within + 1%.
Quarterly checks using a multipurpose phantom &#8594; include verifying correct registration between CT and SPECT scans and verifying adequate AC of uniform sections of the phantom.

title: "How is a major spill handled"
---
1. Clear the area. Notify all persons not involved in the spill to vacate the room.
 2. Prevent the spread of contamination by covering the spill with &quot;caution radioactive material&quot; -labeled absorbent paper, but do not attempt to clean it up. To prevent the spread of contamination, clearly indicate the boundaries of the spill, and limit the movement of all personnel who may be contaminated.
 3. Shield the source, if possible. Do this only if it can be done without further contamination or a significant increase in radiation exposure.
 4. Close the room and lock the door, or secure the area to prevent entry.
 5. Notify the RSO immediately.
 6. Decontaminate the personnel by removing contaminated clothing and flushing contaminated skin with lukewarm water, then washing it with mild soap. If contamination remains, the RSO may consider inducing perspiration. Then wash the affected area again to remove any contamination that was released.

Regression: 
As opposed to correlation analysis (which measures the strength of the relationship between variables), a regression analysis evaluates the impact of a predictor (aka: independent, explanatory) variable.
Purpose of a regression analysis may be to estimate the effect of a predictor variable or the value of the outcome variable on the basis of the values of the predictor variables.
Simple linear regression model: contains one predictor variable, and has linear relationship with the outcome variable.
Goal of linear regression: to fit a straight line through the data that predicts Y based on X &#8594; least squares method is often used to estimate the parameters that determine this line
Multiple regression analysis: performed to evaluate the relationship between an outcome variable and several predictor variables
If the outcome is a continuous variable&#8594; linear regression is often used
If the outcome is a dichotomous variable&#8594; logistic regression is commonly used. 
The odds ratio (i.e. the odds of a particular outcome in the test group compared with the odds of that outcome in the control group) is a common way to express results of a logistic regression.
Issues with regression analysis: 
Have assumptions been met, and how well do the data fit with the model?
Even if a strong relationship is seen, this does not prove causation.
The model should not be used to predict outcomes outside the range of values of the predictor variables in the sample tested.

reverting to behaviors consistent earlier stages of development 
EX. Taking a nap when stressed and getting in the fetal position

-adapting behavior characteristic of a previous developmental level
(EX. turning back to a comforting time)

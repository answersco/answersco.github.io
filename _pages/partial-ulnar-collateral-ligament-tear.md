title: "Partial ulnar collateral ligament tear"
---
This is from throwers who do repetitive VALGUS stressing of their arm
You can see this as the T-sign on MRI where fluid extends BEYOND the sublime tubericle of the ulna
Injury to the anterior bundle is by far the most important

Partial ulnar collateral ligament tear: throwers hurt their UCL (which attaches on the medial coronoid, AKA sublime tubercle)
Ligament has 3 bundles: anterior is most important
T-sign of partial tear: CM extending medial to tubercle

title: "What is free induction decay?"
---
Tissue protons after T1 relaxation are asynchronous.
Following the transmission of a 90&#176; RF pulse&#8594; synchronous precession occurs and the net MZ vector intersects the copper RF coil, inducing an oscillating electric current called the MRI signal.
The observed pulsating AC current in the coil has the same frequency as that of the precessing protons.
After the 90&#176; RF pulse, the magnetization vector rotates at the Larmor frequency in the transverse (xy) plane. FID signal produced is proportional to the xy magnetization vector. The transverse magnetization decays exponentially at time constant T2.

title: "Pitch = distance traveled by the table per gantry rotation / collimation width  pitch = 1.0 = 10 mm/rotation / 10 mm collimation  pitch = 1.5 = 15 mm per rotation/ 10 mm collimation  --------- higher the pitch the faster the table speed and the lower the xray photon deposition so the lower the dose  -pitch and dose are inversely related"

title: "Sensitivity"
---
depth of signal penetration

Different tissues and organs in the body have different ______ to radiation exposure

Sensitivity: the proportion of people who have the disease and test positive for it
Sensitivity (and specificity) are intrinsic properties of a test&#8594; do not depend on the population being tested.
Sn = TP / (TP + FN) [TP + FN = total # of disease positives]
Test with high sensitivity is most useful for ruling out the disease (SNOUT)
Good screening tests have high sensitivity
Tests with high sensitivity have low Type II error rates

TP/TP+FN

Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN)
This is how reliably you are able to detect disease
Highly sensitive tests rule disease OUT,i.e., if you get a negative result then you are ****ing disease free (think about D-dimer)

- ability to detect people WITH disease
- a measure of validity- do this test FIRST
- TP/(TP + FN)

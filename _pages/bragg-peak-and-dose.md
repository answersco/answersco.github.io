title: "Bragg Peak and Dose?"
---
A plot of specific ionization versus distance travelled reveals a sharp increase in ionization potential near the end of a charged particles range. This is known as the Bragg ionization peak. In the case of diagnostic x-ray energies, the Bragg peak occurs at the entrance skin location and a maximal dose is delivered at the skin surface with a falloff in dose deposition with increasing depth.

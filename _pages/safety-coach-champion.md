Safety coach/champion: a person in the organization who takes ownership of the processes and fosters the creation and maintenance of the safety culture, including oversight of any safety-reporting system, whereby safety incidents and near-miss events are reported and archived.
Safety-reporting system: the primary focus is on the patient, the system, and the event in order to identify flawed systems and processes, rather than on the individual (i.e. to assign blame).

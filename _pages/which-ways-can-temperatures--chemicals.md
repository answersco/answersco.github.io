title: "Which ways can temperatures, chemicals, and charged particles move? What uses energy and which does not?"
---
*matter and energy flow down gradients
-Chemicals flow down concentration gradients (high con. to low con.)
-charged particles flow down electrical gradients (neural impulse)
-Heat flows down a thermal gradient (warm blood goes through skin to cool air)

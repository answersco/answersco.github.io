---
Parosteal osteosarcoma: usually early adult/middle age
Loves posterior distal femur
Bulky parosteal bone formation
90% metaphyseal
Buzzword = string sign &#8594; radiolucent line separating bulky tumor from cortex
Low-grade

Periosteal osteosarcoma: usually 15-25 years of age
Diaphyseal, classically medial distal femur
Intermediate grade

Telangiectatic osteosarcoma: may have narrow zone of transition (15%)
High signal on T1 from methemoglobin
Fluid-fluid level is classic &#8594; also seen in ABC and giant cell tumor
Can usually be distinguished by tumor nodularity and enhancement

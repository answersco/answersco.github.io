Nutmeg liver: inhomogeneous, mottled appearance, with delayed enhancement of the periphery of the liver.

Causes:
Budd-Chiari: enlarged caudate lobe. Acute phase shows &quot;flip-flop&quot; pattern on PV phase with low attenuation centrally and high attenuation peripherally.
Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (main hepatic veins and IVC patent, but portal waveforms abnormal with slow, reversed, or to-and-fro pattern due to occlusion of small hepatic venules).
Right heart failure (hepatic congestion- also see refluxed contrast into hepatic veins and increased PV pulsatility)
Constrictive pericarditis (similar findings in liver as R heart failure).

Nutmeg liver: inhomogeneous, mottled appearance, with delayed enhancement of the periphery of the liver.

Causes:
Budd-Chiari: enlarged caudate lobe. Acute phase shows &quot;flip-flop&quot; pattern on PV phase with low attenuation centrally and high attenuation peripherally. Large regenerative (hyperplastic) nodules (T1/T2 bright) in dysmorphic liver.

Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (main hepatic veins and IVC patent, but portal waveforms abnormal with slow, reversed, or to-and-fro pattern due to occlusion of small hepatic venules).

Right heart failure (hepatic congestion- also see refluxed contrast into hepatic veins and increased PV pulsatility)

Constrictive pericarditis (similar findings in liver as R heart failure).

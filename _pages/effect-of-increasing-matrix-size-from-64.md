title: "Effect of increasing matrix size from 64 x 64 to 128 x 128:"
---
64 x 64 matrix has 64 picture elements on each side. As the matrix size increases, there is a decrease in the size of each pixel with increasing detail in each pixel. 
Overall there are also more pixels in the matrix with a quadruple increase for a doubling of the matrix size.
However, the smaller the pixel, the less counts per pixel are present &#8594; therefore the SNR decreases.

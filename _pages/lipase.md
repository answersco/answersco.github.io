title: "Lipase"
---
-breaks down lipids/fat

-We compared two samples, one control sample containing half &amp; half with water added to it and one sample containing half &amp; half with lipase added to it. Additionally, we added the pH indicator phenol red to both samples. Phenol red changes color to indicate what the pH is. At low, acidic levels it because a yellow/orange color, at pH 7 it is red, and at high, basic levels it becomes magenta. When lipase breaks down lipids in solution, the solution becomes mores acidic. Over time we found the half &amp; half sample with water (control) stayed the same color, whereas the half &amp; half sample containing lipase because a yellow-ish color

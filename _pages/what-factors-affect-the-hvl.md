title: "What factors affect the HVL?"
---
Beam Filtration&#8594; &#8593; average photon energy (which determines penetration capacity), and decrease the area under the intensity curve
More filtration&#8594; &#8593; HVL
Less filtration&#8594; lower HVL

With each HVL, the average photon energy goes up
3rd HVL &gt; 2nd HVL &gt; 1st HVL

HVL of an x-ray beam does NOT depend on mAs
HVL does depend on beam filtration and on anode material

Monoenergetic beam has higher HVL than polyenergetic beam at same kVp
10th HVL: thickness of material that can attenuate an x-ray to 90% &#8594; used for shielding calculations

HVL = amount of material required to attenuate beam to 1/2 original intensity. Higher the average photon energy, more penetrating it will be, and higher HVL

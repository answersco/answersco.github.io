title: "Diltiazem"
---
CLASSIFICATION: antihypertensive, CCB

INDICATIONS FOR USE: hypertension, a-fib, angina, increased HR

ACTION: CCB blockers so inhibits calcium influx which decreases contractility and oxygen demand, slows contractions, vasodilation (also dilates coronary arteries)

SIDE EFFECTS: hypotension, edema, bradycardia, arrhythmias

THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS: systemic vasodilation resulting in decreased BP, coronary vasodilation resulting in less numbered and severe angina attacks, reduction of ventricular rate in a-fib

NURSING ASSESSMENT: monitor BP and HR, look for signs of edema

WHAT TO MONITOR: monitor K+ for hypokalemia, monitor renal and hepatic function after long-term therapy

PT TEACHING: swallow tablet whole, avoid grapefruit, contact provider if rash, dizziness, edema, dyspnea, N/V, hypotension, etc

EVALUATION: decrease in BP, decrease in frequency and severity of angina, suppression and prevention of tachyarrhythmias

title: "MRI findings in regenerative, dysplastic, and HCC nodules"

Transformation follows a progression from T2 dark (regenerative) to T2 bright (HCC)
Buzzword = &quot;nodule within a nodule,&quot; where a central bright T2 nodule has a T2 dark border. This is concerning from transformation to HCC.

Regenerative: contains iron
T1 dark, T2 dark
Does NOT enhance

Dysplastic: contains fat, glycoprotein
T1 bright, T2 dark
Usually does NOT enhance

HCC: T2 bright, DOES enhance
Caveat: well-differentiated HCC retains OATP function- bright on 20 minute delayed Eovist sequence (most HCC washes out).

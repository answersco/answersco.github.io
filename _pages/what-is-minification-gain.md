title: "What is minification gain?"
---
Energy gain is the square of(area of the input surface of the II divided by the area of the the output phosphor)
MG = (Din/Dout)^2

The increase in image brightness that results from reduction in image size from the input phosphor to the output phosphor

Electrons from a large surface, concentrated on a smaller surface

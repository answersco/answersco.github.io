Primary components of the superficial veins of the leg: the GSV and the SSV
-Both lie within the SC fat of the LE superficial to the fascial layers of the muscles.

Lateral edge of the foot drains into the SSV, a small vein that ascends along the posterior midline of the calf in a groove between the medial and lateral body of the gastrocs muscle.
-SSV joins the popliteal vein at or just below the knee joint
-In some patients, the SSV also communicates with medial branches of the GSV through the vien of Giacomini (AKA intersaphenous vein)

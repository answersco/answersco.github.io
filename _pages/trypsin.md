-breaks down proteins

-We compared two samples, one control sample of just liquid gelatin and one sample of liquid gelatin containing trypsin. Trypsin is a digestive enzyme that breaks down protein, which is what gelatin is made of. After both rested at room temp for 15 min and then were placed in the fridge, only the control gelatin solidified into jello.

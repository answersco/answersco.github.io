title: "Generating T1 contrast:"
---
The different T1 relaxation rates of tissues following the application of a 90&#186; RF pulse which sets the Mz vector to zero (time = 0). The repetition time, TR, is the operator selected interval between subsequent 90&#186; RF pulses. Selection of a relatively short TR demonstrates contrast determined by the different T1 relaxation times of the tissues. At the selected TR, fat will have the longest Mz vector and thus will appear brightest in the MRI scan. Brain white matter, gray matter, and CSF will be seen as comparatively &quot;less bright&quot; tissues. The differences observed in the tissues results in a T1 contrast MR image.

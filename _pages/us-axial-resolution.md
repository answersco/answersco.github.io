title: "US axial resolution"
---
US axial resolution &#8594; Quantified as the minimum reflector separation necessary to resolve reflectors along a vertical scan line.
Axial resolution = spatial pulse length / 2
&#8593; the frequency of the transducer &#8594; can &#8593; axial resolution, but results in &#8595; penetration into the tissue.
Reflection coefficient (R2) &#8594; indicates the fraction of sound intensity that is reflected at the interface.
Calculated by squaring the difference in impedance of 2 materials divided by their sum.

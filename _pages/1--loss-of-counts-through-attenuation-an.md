title: "1. Loss of counts through attenuation and scatter result in the following artifacts:  2. False high count rates in areas of low attenuation  3. Distortion of areas of high activity like the bladder  4. Prominent surface edge: hot skin  5. Attenuation is more likely when the anhiliation reaction occurs in the center of the body than at the periphery (on a non-atttenuated image there is less activity in the center of the image)  6. High CT density can cause overestimation of tissue FDG concentration producing areas of apparant increased activity."

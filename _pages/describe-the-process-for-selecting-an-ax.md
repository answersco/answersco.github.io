title: "Describe the process for selecting an axial slice in MRI."
---
To select a slice, an rf pulse is transmitted while a gradient is turned on (slice select gradient). While the gradient is turned on, the Larmor frequency varies along the gradient. Only the protons with the same Larmor frequency as the frequency of the rf pulse will be affected by the rf pulse. The selected slice will be perpendicular to the direction of the gradient; the z-axis (craniocaudal) gradient will give an axial slice.

title: "Reducing Intussusception trivia"
---
Contraindictions: Free air, peritonitis (as we could make this worse)
Recurrence: usually w/n 72 hours
Success: 80-90% w/ air
Risk of perforation: 0.5%
Air causes less peritonitis than barium
Pressure should NOT EXCEED 120
NO NEED to reduce if the intussusception is smaller than 2.5 cm

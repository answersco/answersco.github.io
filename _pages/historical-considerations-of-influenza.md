-repeated epidemic and pandemics throughout recorded history
-one of the worst pandemics was Spanish Flu of 1918 with 20 million deaths worldwide - no anti-viral medications and it would sometimes spread to lungs and cause bacterial pneumonia and 500,000 Americans died within first 10 months
-new types of the virus will certainly cause epidemics in the future. Pandemics?

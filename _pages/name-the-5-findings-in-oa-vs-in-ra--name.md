title: "Name the 5 findings in OA vs in RA; name the 2 pointed differences between them (ie, where are they opposites?)  What is the &quot;bare area?&quot;"
---
OA:
1) ASYMMETRIC joint space narrowing
2) Sclerosis of subchondral bone aka &quot;subchondral sclerosis&quot; (stimulated by loss of hyaline cartilage and reactive remodeling)
3) subchondral cystic change
4) osteophytes
5) LACK of periarticular osteopenia

RA: 
1) Marginal EROSIONS (ie, destruction of bone), which FIRST occur in the &quot;BARE AREA&quot; - this is a region of exposed bone just within the joint capsule that is NOT covered by thick cartilage
2) Soft-tissue swelling
3) Diffuse, SYMMETRIC joint space narrowing
4) periarticular osteopenia
5) joint subluxations

In opposition:
1) Joint space narrowing: in RA it is SYMMETRIC joint space narrowing; in OA the joint space narrowing is ASYMMETRIC within that joint
2) Periarticular osteopenia: in RA there IS periarticular osteopenia; in OA there is a LACK of periarticular osteopenia 
3) In both RA and OA, the PIPs can be affected. But in OA the DIPs are affected and the MCP's are usually spared; in RA, the DIPs are usually spared the MCP's are affected

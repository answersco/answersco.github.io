title: "Symptoms and treatment of meningitis"
---
-symptoms: headache, stiffneck, fever, delirium, convulsions
-disruption of blood vessels from release of endotoxin and makes them leak towards skin and subcutaneous tissues - hemorrhage: sometimes so severe the limb loses blood supply and need amputated
-15% mortality w/ treatment - will take a spinal tap and look at cerebral spinal fluid to find out if the person has a bacterial meningitis
-treatment: penicillin G
-prevention: vaccine for high risk groups, epidemics, prophylactic antibiotics (just in case the person was introduced to the bacteria but does not have symptoms yet)

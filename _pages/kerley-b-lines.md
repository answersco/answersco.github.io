Radiate from periphery- Thickened interlobular septa

Linear thin horizontal opacities that run to the periphery of the lung which are the result of fluid in the interlobular septa. These are good indication of congestive failure and early interstitial edema. However, they may also be seen when the interlobular septa are packed with tumor, usually unilateral, so it is not a specific sign.

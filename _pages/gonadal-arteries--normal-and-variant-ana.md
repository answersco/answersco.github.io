title: "Gonadal arteries- normal and variant anatomy"
---
70%: gonadal arteries arise from anterior surface of abdominal aorta just below renal arteries
Most common variant origin is from the renal arteries (20%), followed by adrenal, lumbar, or iliac arteries.

Testicular arteries: have a more lateral course, entering spermatic cord to continue into scrotum
Ovarian arteries: more medial path, through suspensory ligament of ovaries, providing branches to ovary and fallopian tubes. The artery then continues medially to the uterus, where it anastomoses with the uterine artery in the broad ligament.

title: "Arterial supply of foot: AT"
---
Much variability of arterial supply to foot.
-AT and PT provide the bulk of the arterial supply to the foot.
-AT continues into the foot below the level of the ankle joint as the dorsalis pedis artery. The medial and lateral tarsal arteries are large branches that arise from the proximal DP.
-At the level of the metatarsals, the DP bifurcates into a deep plantar branch and the arcuate artery
-Arcuate artery curves toward the lateral edge of the foot along the dorsal aspect of the MT bases, supplying the dorsal metatarsal arteries to the distal foot before anastomosing with distal branches of the plantar arteries.

Scimitar syndrome= hypoplastic lung that is drained by an anomalous vein into the systemic venous system. 

pulmonary hypoplasia and partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR). 
-almost exclusively occurs on the right side.

Haemodynamically, there is an acyanotic left to right shunt. The anomalous vein usually drains into:
 inferior vena cava: most common
 right atrium
 portal vein

The lung is frequently perfused by the aorta, but the bronchial tree is still connected and thus the lung is NOT sequestered.

part of the congenital veno - lobar syndrome ( TAPVR- PAPVR )

Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return. Affected side will have hypoplastic lung. Drainage most commonly into the IVC

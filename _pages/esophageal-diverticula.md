title: "Esophageal diverticula:"
---
Pulsion diverticula: caused by &#8593; esophageal pressure and comprise nearly all diverticula seen in US
Traction diverticula: caused by traction of adjacent strictures, usually from TB adenopathy. Rarely seen.

Zenker diverticulum: may present with halitosis, 
aspiration, regurgitation of undigested food
Caused by failure of the cricopharyngeus muscle to relax, leading to &#8593; hypopharyngeal pressure.
Protrudes posteriorly, usually with hypertrophy of the cricopharyngeus muscle.
Pseudo-Zenker: barium trapped in a pharyngeal contraction wave

Killian-Jameson (KJ) diverticulum: located at KJ space, which is an area of weakness below the attachment of the cricopharyngeus muscle
In contrast to Zenker diverticulum, KJ are more often bilateral, and protrude anteriorly, best seen on lateral view.

Pseudodiverticulosis: imaging finding of multiple tiny outpouchings into the esophageal lumen caused by dilated submucosal glands from chronic reflux esophagitis.
Often associated with a smooth stricture in the mid/upper esophagus

title: "Typical injected activity of 201 Thallous chloride and Tc99m sestamibi for myocardial perfusion"
---
30 mCi is typical for the 99mTc tracer
3 mCi commonly used for 201Tl&#8594; smaller injected activity due to the slower excretion, longer half-life, and more radiosensitive critical organ compared to those for the 99mTc tracer.
&#8594; critical organs for 201Tl are the thyroid and testes
&#8594; critical organ for 99mTc-sestamibi is the colon.

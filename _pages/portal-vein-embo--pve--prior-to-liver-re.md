title: "Portal vein embo (PVE) prior to liver resection: rationale"
---
PVE induces hypertrophy of the future liver remnant (FLR) before partial hepatectomy for localized primary or metastatic tumor.
Occlusion of peripheral intrahepatic PV branches triggers hepatocyte regeneration in non-embolized liver segments.

PVE is most often necessary before resection of more than 3 Couinaud segments (usually a right hepatectomy).
Estimated minimal residual liver volume to tolerate extended partial hepatectomy varies depending on healthy of liver.
-Normal liver: 20%
-Unlerlying parenchymal disease: 40%
-Prior chemo: 30%.

FLR hypertrophy occurs in 3-4 weeks, and peaks by 6 weeks.

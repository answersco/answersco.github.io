Thyroid ophthalmopathy
Initially &#8593; in intraorbital fat, followed by enlargement of extraocular muscles and exophthalmos.
Inferior rectus is most commonly affected first
Order of involvement: I'M SLow &#8594; inferior rectus&#8594; medial rectus&#8594; superior rectus&#8594; lateral rectus.
Isolated lateral rectus muscle involvement is very uncommon in thyroid ophthalmopathy, and should prompt search for alternative diagnosis (e.g. orbital pseudotumor).
Unlike pseudotumor, thyroid ophthalmopathy tends to be bilateral and spares the muscle tendons.

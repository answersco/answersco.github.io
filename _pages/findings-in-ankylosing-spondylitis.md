Basics: can be associated with pulmonary fibrosis (upper lobe predominant), aortitis, and cardiac conduction defects.
Earliest XR signs&#8594; symmetric erosions, widening, and sclerosis of the Si joints
Subsequent involvement of the spine, with XR findings following a specific sequence that ascens from the lumbar to the cervical spine.
Romanus lesions: erosions of the anterior superior or inferior edges of the vertebral body endplates caused by enthesitis (inflammation at ligament or tendon insertion site) at the annulus fibrosus.
Shiny corners: represent sclerosis of prior Romanus lesions at the corners of the vertebral bodies.
Squaring of the vertebral body disc margins&#8594; develops due to erosions and bone loss
Delicate syndesmophytes: represent bony bridging connecting adjacent vertebral margins &#8594; create the classic bamboo spine (spinal ankylosis) in late-stage disease.
Dagger sign: fusion of spinous processes
Advanced disease&#8594; fully ankylosed spine at very high risk for fracture after even minor trauma.
Andersson lesions&#8594; pseudarthrosis occurring in a completely ankylosed spine.

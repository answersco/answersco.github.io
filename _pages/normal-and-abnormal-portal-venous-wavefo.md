title: "Normal and abnormal portal venous waveform"
---
Normal: flow should always be towards liver (antegrade)
Waveform should be a gentle undulation, always above baseline.
Normal velocity: 20-40 cm/s
Portal vein pulsatility: right heart failure, tricuspid regurgitation, cirrhosis with vascular AP shunting.
Portal vein reversal of flow: portal HTN
Absent flow: thrombosis, tumor invasion, and stagnant flow from bad portal HTN
Slow-flow: velocity &lt; 15 cm/s
Portal HTN
Pre: Portal vein thrombosis
Intra: Cirrhosis
Post: Right heart failure, tricuspid regurgitation, budd-chiari.

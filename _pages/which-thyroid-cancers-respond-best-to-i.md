title: "Which thyroid cancers respond best to I-131?"
---
Papillary (most common): microcalcifications in tumor and nodes. Mets via lymphatics. Excellent prognosis.

Follicular (2nd most common): hematogenous mets, but survival still pretty good.

Hurthle cell (follicular variant): doesn't take up I-131 as well as normal follicular.
Surveillance with PET.

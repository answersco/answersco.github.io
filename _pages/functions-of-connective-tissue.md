title: "Functions of Connective Tissue"
---
1) bind organs together: tendons/ligaments
2) support: bones/cartilage
3) physical protection: cranium, ribs, sternum incapsulate organs underneath
4) Immune: foreign invaders kept out
5) Movements: bones are a lever system
6) Storage: calcium and phosphate (bones) and fat (adipose)
7) Heat: brown fat (burns off when older) goes through glycolysis
8) Transport: blood---gases, nutrients, waste products

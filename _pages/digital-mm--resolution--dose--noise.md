title: "Digital MM: resolution, dose, noise"
---
Smaller pixels = better spatial resolution
Can lose some spatial resolution from spread of electronic or light signal inside digital or computed detectors.
Most digital systems have lower spatial resolution (~5-11 lp/mm) relative to analog (11-13 lp/mm)
MQSA does NOT have specific line-pair requirements for digital&#8594; linked to manufacturer's specifications.

Digital machines have ~15% less dose than analog due to better beam quality and fewer repeat exams.
Dose is not fixed (fixed with screen-film)

Digital images have variable contrast, which can be altered using window and level. The noise is fixed after exposure is taken.

Dark-noise: from electronic fluctuations within the 
detector elements &#8594; effect is proportional to the temperature of the detector &#8594; seen more with underexposed regions.

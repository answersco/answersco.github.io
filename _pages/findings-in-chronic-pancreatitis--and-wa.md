Early chronic pancreatitis: 
Loss of T1 signal (pancreas normally brightest T1 structure in abdomen)
Delayed enhancement
Dilated side branches

Late:
Commonly small, uniformly atrophic&#8594; can have focal enlargement
30% with pseudocysts
Dilation and beading of pancreatic duct with calcifications

Ductal dilatation in chronic pancreatitis vs. pancreatic cancer
CP: dilation is irregular, and duct is &lt; 50% of AP gland diameter
Cancer: dilation usually uniform, and duct &gt; 50% of AP gland diameter (obstructive atrophy).

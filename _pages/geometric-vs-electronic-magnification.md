title: "Geometric vs electronic magnification"
---
Geometric magnification is where you magnify by DECREASING the distance between the focal spot (source of xrays) and the object. Consequence:
1. INCREASED dose which follows a SQUARED relationship
2. Geometric blur is going to increase

Note: 
- You get MORE magnification with a smaller focal spot AND this decreases the degree of blur (SEE IMAGE for alternative explanation of mag for geometric)

Electronic magnification: Process of magnification through the use of focusing electrodes.
Consequence:
1. If you decrease the FOV, you are decreasing the amount of the phosphor input that is getting irradiated which in turn drops the brightness. In response, the automatic brightness control (ABC) increases the dose!

*<b>NOTE</b>*
- BOTH forms of magnification are going to INCREASE the dose however the geometric form increases dose MORE

A few important notes:

1. Spatial resolution is INCREASED by electronic magnification
2. The main limiter of spatial resolution is the quality of the DISPLAY or TV

title: "What energy would be typical for an iodine escape peak from a Tc-99m source?"
---
Answer: 112 keV
Iodine escape peak: results from a photoelectric interaction of the iodine atoms within a NaI crystal.
The incoming 140 keV undergoes photoelectric absorption and the characteristic K-shell x-ray of iodine (28 keV) escapes.
The iodine escape peak is therefore at an energy of: 140 keV - 28 keV = 112 keV

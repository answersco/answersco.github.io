title: "Define resting membrane potential and action potential."
---
-Resting Membrane Potential: about -70 mV; this means that the inside of the neuron is 70 mV less than the outside. At rest, there are relatively more sodium ions outside the neuron and more potassium ions inside that neuron. 
-Action Potential: An action potential occurs when a neuron sends information down an axon, away from the cell body.

Root Cause Analysis (RCA): structured method used to analyze serious adverse events, widely employed as an error analysis tool in healthcare

Central tenet: identifying underlying problems that increase the likelihood of errors while avoiding the trap of focusing on mistakes by individuals

Goal of RCA is thus to identify both active errors (those occurring at the point of interface between humans and a complex system) and latent errors (hidden problems within healthcare systems that contribute to adverse events).
Ultimate goal is to prevent future harm by eliminating the latent errors that so frequently underlie adverse events.

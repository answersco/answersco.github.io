Most direct approach is from antegrade puncture in ipsilateral CFA, which provides the greatest mechanical advantage and permits use of standard length delivery system.
-Antegrade approach frequently not possible because of large abdominal pannus.

From contralateral approach, a 30-45 cm flexible sheath placed over the Ao bifurcation provides a stable platform for most interventions.
-Longer guidewires often necessary.

Lester started collecting lunch boxes when he was 5 years old. He had 26 superhero lunch boxes, 15 outer space lunch boxes, and 17 rock band lunch boxes.
Then Lester's cousin started her own lunch box collection. Lester wanted to help her get started, so he gave his cousin 19 lunch boxes from his collection. How many lunch boxes does Lester have left in his collection?

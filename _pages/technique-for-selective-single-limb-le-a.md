Provides excellent filling of vessels with less dilution of contrast
-Inflow vessels examined with pelvic (or Ao and pelvic) arteriography
-Subsequently, when access is from ipsilateral CFA, a 5-Fr straight multiple side-hole or tightly recurved end-hole catheter can be withdrawn into EIA.
-When access is from contralateral CFA, an end-hole catheter (such as Sos or Cobra-2) can be positioned over the Ao bifurcation in the CIA or EIA. 
-Contrast injection rates of 4 mL/sec provide excellent opacification using bolus chase or standing runs.

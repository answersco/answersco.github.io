title: "Errors in writing nursing diagnoses"

potential sources of errors:
1) incomplete or inaccurate data collection
2) incorrect clustering of cues/data
3) misinterpretation and analysis of cues/data
4) addressing a problem outside of the scope of nursing practice - cannot use medical diagnosis such as COPD R/T alveoli exchange damage, pneumonia

imprisoned Vietnam War resister case; he thinks he's committing the crime of sending letters w/o warden's consent (but the warden ACTUALLY knows/consented); legal impossibility makes it NOT a crime, so CAN'T be an attempted crime; the actual offense required lack of warden's consent, so he's not guilty of crime or attempt; NOTE: This would be different under the MPC (would be guilty of attempt)

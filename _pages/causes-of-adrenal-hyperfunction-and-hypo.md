title: "Causes of adrenal hyperfunction and hypofunction:"
---
Adrenal hyperfunction:
Cushing syndrome: excess cortisol production from non-pituitary disease, such as idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia, adenoma, or ectopic/paraneoplastic ACTH (e.g. from SCLC)
Cushing disease: excess cortisol production driven by excessive pituitary ACTH
Conn syndrome: excess aldosterone production, usually from adrenal adenoma
Causes HTN and hyperkalemia
Adrenal cortical carcinoma: can cause increase in all cortical adrenal hormones and precursors
Pheochromocytoma: &#8593; catecholamines

Adrenal hypofunction:
Addison disease: chronic adrenocortical insufficiency&#8594; may be due to autoimmune destruction or secondary to infection
Waterhouse-Friedrichsen syndrome: post-hemorrhagic adrenal failure secondary to Neisseria meningitidis bacteremia
Idiopathic adrenal hemorrhage: rarely causes hypofunction

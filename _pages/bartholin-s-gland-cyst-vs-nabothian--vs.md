Look for the pubic symphysis!

Bartholin is BELOW the pubic symphysis and near the Butt (e.g. posterolateral lower 1/3 vagina, associated with labia)

Gardner's duct is up higher in the upper anterior vagina = INCOMPLETE REGRESSION of the Wolffian Ducts and cause mass effect on urethra

SKene's duct = also below pubic symphysis bc related to the &quot;SKinny urethra&quot;
- can cause recurrent UTI

Nabothain is what you see al the time in cervix (T2 bright due to plugging of mucous bands)

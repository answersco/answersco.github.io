title: "Photoelectric absorption (PEA) is the dominant x-ray interaction in all of the following, except: CXR, MM, contrast CT, gamma camera crystal, barium fluoroscopy?"

Answer: CXR
PEA is the dominant interaction of x-ray and gamma rays in high Z absorbers where it increases with Z-cubed (as in bone, barium-based and iodine-based contrast, and NaI gamma camera crystal)
PEA is also higher at low-energy radiation in lower-Z tissues, as in MM.
In CXR, the relatively high beam energy in the chest with lower Z makes Compton scatter the dominant interaction.

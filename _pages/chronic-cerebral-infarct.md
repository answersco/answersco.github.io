Chronic infarct (&gt; 2 weeks)
Infarct involvement of corticospinal tract may cause mass effect, mild hyperintensity on T2, and eventual atrophy of ipsilateral cerebral peduncle and ventral pons due to Wallerian degeneration.
DWI usually returns to normal.
Occasionally see cortical laminar necrosis instead of encephalomalacia&#8594; manifests as hyperintensity on T1 and T2.

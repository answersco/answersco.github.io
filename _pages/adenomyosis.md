title: "Adenomyosis:"
---
Endometrial tissue migrated into myometrium, usually in multiparous women of reproductive age and prior procedures.
Favors large portions of the uterus, especially posterior wall &#8594; spares cervix.
Marked enlargement of uterus with normal contour.
MRI: thickening of the junctional zone &gt; 12 mm (normal &lt; 5 mm)
Also small, high-T2-signal regions due to cystic change.

-endometrial tissue in myometrium
-multiparous women with C-section, D&amp;C
-POSTERIOR wall, spares cervix

US: heterogeneous uterus or enlarged posterior wall
MR: thickening of junctional zone &gt;12 mm, subendometrial cysts

Endometrium within myometrium. If diffuse, uterus is heterogeneous. If focal (adenoma) may simulate fibroid

junctional zone &gt;12mm

growth of endometrium into the muscular portion of the uterus, i.e, the myometriu
Findings: Enlargement of the TRANSITIONAL ZONE to &gt; 12 mm (normal &lt;5 mm), also small T2 bright cystic areas in the myometrium

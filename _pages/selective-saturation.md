title: "Selective saturation"
---
Fat precesses slightly slower than water
Difference proportional to magnet strength
Preparatory pulse (narrow RF pulse that only targets fat frequency) -&gt; spoiler gradient dephases primed protons -&gt; primed protons do not produce signal -&gt; start with normal RF pulse
Requires field homogeneity (metal, local field inhomogeneities -&gt; poor fat saturation -&gt; mimics edema)
Cannot be done with low strength (&lt; 1.0T) magnets (cannot separate frequencies)
Works with gadolinium
Increases acquisition time

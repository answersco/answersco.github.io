title: "Imaging appearances of reactivation and healed TB:"

Most commonly occurs in the upper lobe apical and posterior segments
Immunocompetent patient: imaging hallmarks are upper-lobe predominant disease with cavitation and lack of adenopathy. Common focal upper lobe consolidation and endobronchial spread (suggested by tree-in-bud nodules)
Immunosuppressed patient: low-attenuation adenopathy is a typical additional finding, and may mimic immune reconstitution or primary TB.
Tuberculoma: well-defined rounded opacity, usually in the upper lobes

Healed TB: apical scarring, usually with upper lobe volume loss and superior hilar retraction.
Calcified granulomas may be present as well.

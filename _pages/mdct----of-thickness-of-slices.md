title: "MDCT: # of thickness of slices"
---
The # of detectors in the axial direction determines the # of slices that can be simultaneously acquired
MDCT can acquire images with &quot;isotropic resolution&quot; &#8594; can do non-axial reconstructions without stretching the pixels.
Minimal slice thickness determined by the detector element aperture width.

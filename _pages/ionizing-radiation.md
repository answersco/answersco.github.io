title: "Ionizing radiation"
---
A 15eV photon is required to removed an electron from an atom
Remember SMALL wavelength = high energy
Hard xrays: these are below .1-.2 nm - these are xrays that we can use for imaging purposes, larger xrays do not generate good image

-sterilization
-increases shelf life
-used on heat/sensitive materials
-harmful to people
EX. radiation

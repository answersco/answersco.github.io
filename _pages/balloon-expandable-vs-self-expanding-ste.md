title: "Balloon-expandable vs self-expanding stents"
---
Balloon-expandable: deployed by applying force from within (usually with angioplasty balloon)
-Resist elastic recoil
-Will not reexpand spontaneously if the resistance is temporarily overcome (i.e. stent remains collapsed).

Self-expanding stents: attempt to reach a predetermined diameter unless continuously and externally constrained.
-Not as resistant to elastic recoil
-Reexpand spontaenously if compressed- desirable in superficial locations such as cervical carotid artery and SFA.

Sarcoidosis: when it involves the spleen, it typically manifests as splenomegaly, often with hepatomegaly and LAD
Less commonly, it may produce a multinodular pattern with numerous 1-3 cm hypoattenuating lesions demonstrating essentially no enhancement, and low signal on all MRI sequences.
Imaging appearance is generally indistinguishable from splenic lymphoma

Embo of gastroesophageal varices should be performed.

Coil embo of the main trunk of the varix will suffice.
More distal embo can be obtained by first injecting gelatin sponge pieces soaked in a sclerosant (e.g. 3% sodium tetradecyl sulfate [STS], STS/iodized oil foam, or dehydrated alcohol) into the varices.

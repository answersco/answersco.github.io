title: "Classical Xray interaction with human"
---
This is where the photon enters the person, interacts with an orbital electron WITHOUT ejection, is deflected, and therefore changes direction (basically this is a lil bitch photon that does not have the energy to knock off an electron)
Does NOT result in ionization
Does NOT result in net transfer of energy
Does NOT contribute to image
DOES add small dose to the patient
Seen at LOW energy (approx 10 KeV)

title: "Risk factors of CIN"
---
1. PRE existing renal insufficiency does confer an increased risk.

2. level at which the risk is significant is contraversial: ACR manual says 2.0 gm/dl in patients with chronic stable renal insufficiency

3. acute kidney injury is aso a rsik and in this case the creatinine isnt an accurate measure of actual renal function

other proposed risk factors: DM dehydration, heart disease, diuretic use, old age, Multiple myeloma, HTN, hyperuricemia, and multiple studies within 24 hours

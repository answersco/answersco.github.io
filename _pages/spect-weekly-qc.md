Attenuation correction high-count maps
Center of rotation (COR) tests&#8594; COR offset results in mismatched reconstructed rays and image blurring.
High-count extrinsic counts tests
Weekly to monthly: High count extrinsic floods &#8594; these extrinsic uniformity tests (with a collimator) detect and correct for flood field non-uniformities. If this test isn't performed, it can result in generation of concentric ring artifacts in transaxial sections.

title: "MRI sequences for Implant?"

Heavy T2 weighting with Fat and Water Sat = &quot;silicone sequences&quot; = silicone will be very bright on both of these!

Saline never forms a capsule so there's no issue of intracapsular

- A small amt of peri-implant fluid is a NORMAL finding

- You can have isolated intracapsular rupture (but NEVER ISOLATED EXTRAcapsular rupture)

Don't see the kidneys (but there's no abnormal focal uptake because EVERYTHING is hot!)
* Just make sure it's not a hidden horseshoe kidney :-)

- Diffuse Mets
- HyperPTH (metabolic - could also be renal osteodystrophy, paget's, or severe thyrotoxicosis) = Skull is asymmetrically hot with PTH and see soft tissue uptake in lung/pancreas/stomach/kidneys

* Malignancy tends to spare the distal extremities

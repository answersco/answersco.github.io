title: "Vascular System Involvement in Beh&#231;et Disease"
---
-Although the vascular system is involved in only 25-30% of patients with Beh&#231;et disease, it is still the major cause of mortality. 
-Vasculitis can affect arteries and veins of any size; however, venous system involvement is more frequent than arterial system involvement (85% of vasc involvement) 
-Involvement of the venous system is most frequently seen in the form of thrombophlebitis (lower extremity, SVC, IVC) 
-most serious venous complications are SVC syndrome and Budd-Chiari syndrome. 
-Venous aneurysms are rare complications 
-Arterial manifestations involve aneurysm formation (65%) and occlusions (35%) [1]. The abdominal aorta is the most commonly affected vessel 
-most common cause of pulmonary artery aneurysm is 
-Occlusion of the main pulmonary arteries or their branches is another complication. Thrombosis of the pulmonary arteries may accompany aneurysms and occlusions (Fig. 8). When seen, hemoptysis is a result of aneurysm rupture and thrombosis.

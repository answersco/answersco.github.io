Short microcolon: think about colonic atresia
Long microcolon: Seen w/ ileal atresia or meconium ileus (this is because the colon needs to be bathed in secretions in order to form normally)
Meconium ileus ONLY happens in patient with cystic fibrosis
Caliber change of normal to stenosed bowel: Can be seen in Hirschsprungs disease OR small left colon syndrome 
Meconium Plug: this is TRANSIENT and can be relieved with barium enema. NOT associated with cystic fibrosis. This is seen in infants of DIABETIC mothers or who have received Mgsulfate for eclampsia
Hirschsprung disease: Failure of ganglion cells to migrate, 4:1 more common in boys, 10% associated w/ downs, Dx w/ rectal bx 
Ways of showing HS disease:
rectosigmoid ratio &lt; 1, means the rectum is SMALLER than the sigmoid
Rectum with SAWTOOTH pattern related to spasm (see image)

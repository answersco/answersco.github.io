title: "X-ray spectrum: effect of changing mA, kVp, changing x-ray targets. What causes loss of characteristic x-rays?"
---
Changing mA changes area under the curve
Changing kVp changes average energy and max energy
Changing x-ray targets: characteristic peaks change
Loss of characteristic x-rays: if kVp dropped below threshold for k-shell electrons

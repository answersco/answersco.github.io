title: "Biliary atresia vs neonatal hepatitis"
---
Should pretreat with phenobarbital to upregulate the liver function

Tracer in the bowel suggests hepatitis. Need to perform delayed imaging (24 hours if needed).

Biliary atresia: clearance of blood pool, but no visualization of GB or excretion into bowel by 24 hours

IF activity in the bowel, then is IS hepatitis
HAVE to wait at least 24 hours before you call this
ALSO should premedicate with phenobarbitol 2.5 mg/kg BID x 5 days to make sute the hepatocytes are going to take up max tracer

neonatal hepatitis
- may need super delayed images (24 hours) in kids because of slow movement of tracer

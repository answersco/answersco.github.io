title: "Internal Conversion"

This is the arch nemesis of gamma emission
This is where the nucleus rather than underoing an ISOMERIC conversion and giving off gama rays instead transmits that excess energy to ejecting an electron as the amount of energy it needs to give off is equal to or greater than the binding energy
This is BAD because now you emitted an electron that can then go **** up biological tissue

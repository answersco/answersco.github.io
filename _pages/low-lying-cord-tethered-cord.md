title: "Low lying cord/tethered cord"
---
First, a low conus is any conus that is BELOW L2 and a thickened filum terminale (&gt; 2mm)
This occurs because the spinal canal grows faster than the cord itself, so if it gets tethered then the cord will get stretched then become ischemic 
Two types: Primary - isolated or Secondary - associated with myelomeningocele, filum terminale lipoma, or trauma. 
SECONDARY: more likely to be shown on MRI
PRIMARY: more likely to be shown on ultrasound
High yield trivia:
1. Anal atresia: strong association for cord problems (including tethering). Should get screened
2. Tethered cord linked with spina bifida (tufts of hair)
3. HIGH dimples (above the gluteal cleft) need to be screened. LOW dimples (below the gluteal cleft) do NOT need to be screened

title: "Specular Reflector"
---
This is going to be a reflector that has dimensions that are much larger than that of the wavelength of the incident sound wave

*<b>Strength of reflection is going to be highly dependent on the ANGLE</b>*
*<b> Truly smooth reflectors are relatively INDEPENDENT of frequency</b>*

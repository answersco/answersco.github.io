Thrombolysis (pharm, mechanical, or both) may be helpful when extensive thrombus is present, particularly in small vessels of hand.
-Can be performed from either femoral or brachial artery (antegrade or retrograde) approach.
-For very distal thrombosis, good results with thrombolysis often obtained with catheter in distal brachial artery to perfuse entire forearm and hand.

When source of distal embo is a focal AS lesion in subclavian or axillary artery, dilation and stent placement can be performed.
-Self-expanding stent should be used because it will not remain crushed if accidentally compressed.
-Treatment of proximal subclavian artery thrombus risks vertebral artery embo and stroke.

Thallium: produced in cyclotron
-Decays by electron capture: daughter mercury 201 creates characteristic x-rays of 69 and 81 keV
-Half life = ~3 days (73 hours)
-Behaves like potassium: crosses cell membrane via active transport- acts as a viability marker (requires living cell for transport).
-Tumors and inflammatory conditions increase uptake of this tracer- higher grade tumor, more uptake.
-Normal distribution: thyroid, salivary glands, lung, heart, skeletal muscle, liver, spleen, bowel, kidneys, bladder. Muscle twitching is hot.
-If used with gallium, must use thallium first as Gallium will scatter all over the thallium peaks.

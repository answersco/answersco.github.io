ductal carcinoma in situ
Earliest form of breast cancer
Most common appearance on ultrasound is microlobulated, mildly hypoechoic, with normal acoustic transmission

Ways this can be shown:
- suspicious calcifications on a mammo (fine linear branching or fine pleomorphic)
- Non mass enhancement on MRI
- Multiple intraductal masses on gamma

- Non mass enhancement on MRI
- Multiple intraductal masses on galactography

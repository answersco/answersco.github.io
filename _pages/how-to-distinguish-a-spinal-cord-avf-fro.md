title: "How to distinguish a spinal cord AVF from an AVM?"

AVF = most common; due to connection between radiculomedullary artery to the coronal venous plexus surrounding the cord --&gt; cord edema and enlarged venous plexus (due to congestion not arterial ischemia)

AVM = look for FLOW VOIDS WITHIN THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CORD

title: "90&#186; RF pulse?"
---
The application of an RF &quot;pulse&quot; that not only synchronizes the precessional motion of the protons producing transverse magnetization Mxy but equalizes the parallel and anti-parallel protons such that the net longitudinal magnetization is zero and the only net vector of magnetism is the transverse vector. A 90&#186; RF pulse produces the largest Mxy vector and thus the strongest MRI signal for that voxel of tissue.

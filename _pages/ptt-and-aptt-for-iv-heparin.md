title: "PTT and aPTT for IV heparin"
---
-desired therapeutic range for anticoagulation at 1 1/2 to 3 times normal PTT or APTT value (takes more time to clot which is what we want)**
-for example if normal PTT or APTT is 20 seconds, the therapeutic value would be 30&#8212;60 seconds (if comes back at 25 sec, may have to increase dose and give a loading dose, after this you would check in six hours - every time you made a dose adjustment you need to recheck the value 6 hours later, if 148 sec then decrease the dose; can stop checking every six hours when you checked levels and they were therapeutic twice in a row then you go to 24 hour or daily check) 
-it is ideal to not draw your aPTT from the same arm as your heparin drip is going to unless it is below the IV site line bc if you draw above, you can accidentally draw some heparin and cause lab value to be extremely high (&gt; 180)
-if prophylaxis, should not alter PTT much b/c dosage is much lower and given SQ so longer duration

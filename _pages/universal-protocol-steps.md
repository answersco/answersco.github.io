Universal Protocol: 3-step process
Conduct a pre-procedure verification process

Mark the procedure site:
At a minimum, the site should be marked when there is more than one possible location for the procedure, and when performing the procedure in a different location could harm the patient.
The mark should be unambiguous and used consistently throughout the organization.

Perform a time-out: must be documented
When the patient has 2 or more planned procedures, if the person performing the procedure changes, another time-out needs to be performed before starting each procedure.

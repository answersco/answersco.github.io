title: "How do you calculate the change in x-ray beam intensity that occurs from increasing the distance between the object and x-ray source from 3 meters to 5 meters (assuming original intensity at 3 m is 1.0)?"

Change in intensity: calculated by square of the ratio of the 2 distances
Here: (&#8535;)^2 = 0.36

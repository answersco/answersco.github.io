Red marrow
T1: always slightly hyperintense to muscle and disc (due to scatted fat cells)
T2: can be difficult to distinguish from yellow marrow as both are somewhat hyperintense
STIR: red marrow remains hyperintense, cf. yellow marrow which is saturated out

Yellow marrow
* follows subcutaneous fat on all sequences!

title: "Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis?"
---
Filling of alveolar spaces with lipid-rich proteinaceous material, Patchy or geographic ground-glass opacity, smooth, interlobular septal thickening in ground-glass--&quot;crazy paving&quot;&quot;.

Strongly associated with smoking
Increased risk of Nocardia infx (including brain abscess)
If in children, associated with alymphoplasia
Can progress to pulmonary fibrosis (30%)
Treatment is BAL

Always shown as crazy paving (interlobular septal thickening + GGO)
Primary (90%) or secondary (associated with cancer or inhalation [silico-proteinosis]).

Crazy paving, treated &amp; diagnosed with alveolar lavage; congenital (rare) or acquired (90% smoking), secondary (CA, HIV, fumes)

Lipoproteinaceous material deposits within alveoli. Predilection for males in their 20s to 40s. Bilateral symmetric perihilar airspace opacification. Crazy paving CT finding: Geographic ground-glass opacities with thickened interlobular and intralobular septa. Prone to superinfection with Nocardia, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and atypical mycobacteria.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP): idiopathic disease causing filling of the alveoli with proteinaceous, lipid-rich material.
CXR: may resemble pulmonary edema with perihilar opacification.
PAP usually has normal heart size and pleural effusions are uncommon
CT: hallmark is crazy-paving pattern of smooth interlobular septal thickening in areas of patchy or geometric GGO
Nonspecific finding: also seen in pneumocystis PNA, COP, BAC, lipoid PNA, and other entities.
Patients with PAP are susceptible to superimposed infection, classically Nocardia&#8594; typically presents as consolidation.
Treatment of PAP is via bronchoalveolar lavage.

Can be primary or secondary (90% of time primary) - treated with bronchopulmonary lavage 
These peeps are at increased risk of nocardia infection
Smoking is strongly associated with the disease

Findings: You will see CRAZY PAVING (image)
** Know that crazy paving can also be seen in things like edema, hemorrhage, or lung adenocarcinoma

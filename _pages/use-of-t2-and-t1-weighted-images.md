---
T2-weighted images&#8594; T2-hyperintensity within the enhancing portion of a mass is highly suggestive of benign lesion
Myxoid FA in younger woman&#8594; usually T2-hyperintense
Isolated evaluation of T2 signal characteristics is not reliable to classify a lesion as benign.
Mucinous carcinoma&#8594; typically T2 hyperintense.

T1-weighted images&#8594; susceptibility artifact from biopsy clips or calcification
Hyperintense hemorrhagic cysts and proteinaceous duct fluid.

PE probability via PIOPED study (V - ventilation, Q - perfusion):
High (88% have PE)
&#8226; &gt;= 2 large Q defects without matching V defect or CXR finding
&#8226; &gt;= 2 large Q defects which are larger than either V defect or CXR finding
Intermediate (30%)
&#8226; 1 moderate to 1.5 large Q defects without matching V defect or CXR finding
&#8226; matched V/Q defects and equal or smaller CXR findings
&#8226; difficult to categorize as low or high
Low (13%)
&#8226; Q defect regardless of V with a much larger CXR finding
&#8226; Q defects of any size that are matched with V defects and are normal on CXR
&#8226; Any number of small Q defects with normal CXR
&#8226; Non-segmental Q defects
Very Low (5%)
&#8226; Mild Q irregularity without segmental or subsegmental distribution and normal CXR
Normal
&#8226; No Q defects

title: "Acceptable post-intervention pressure gradients (mm Hg): arterial, venous, TIPS"
---
Arterial:
-Parameter = systolic
-At rest: &lt;/= 10
-Augmented (following injection of 200-300 ug NG or 15-25 mg tolazine distal to lesion): &lt;/= 15

Venous:
-Parameter = mean
-At rest: &lt;/= 5
-Augmented: N/A

TIPS:
-Parameter = mean (portal to IVC for variceal bleeding, or 50% decrease from initial gradient for ascites)
-At rest: &lt;/= 12
-Augmented: N/A

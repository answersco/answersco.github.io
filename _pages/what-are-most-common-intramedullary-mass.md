title: "What are most common intramedullary masses in kids vs adults and how to tell apart?"
---
Kids = Astrocytoma = (same as in brain) = T1 dark, T2 bright, heterogeneously enhancing lesion; Indistinct ECCENTRIC with CORD EXPANSION; longer segment

Adults = Ependymoma = Central, homogeneously enhancing mass, well-circ mass with SYMMETRIC cord expansion
- LOOK FOR HEMORRHAGE

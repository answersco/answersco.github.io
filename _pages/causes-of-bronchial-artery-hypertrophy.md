title: "Causes of bronchial artery hypertrophy"
---
Chronic inflammation and hyperemia lead to enlargement of bronchial arteries and recruitment of collaterals from other systemic thoracic arteries.
PA occlusion can also lead to bronchial and collateral artery enlargement due to systemic to pulmonary shunting.

Causes:
Cystic fibrosis
Chronic infection
-Fungal
-TB
-PNA
-Abscess
Chronic granulomatous disease
-Sarcoidosis
-Wegener granulomatosis
Bronchiectasis
Congenital pulmonary stenosis/atresia with systemic pulmonary collaterals
Acquire PA stenosis/occlusion
Tumor (rare)
Systemic to pulmonary arterioarterial malformation.

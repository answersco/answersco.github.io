title: "Dose calibrator: constancy, linearity, and geometry"
---
Constancy test commonly performed using a long-lived source such as Cs-137.
Inter-day readings should agree within + 5%.
Dose calibrator linearity &#8594; should be verified at installation, after repair, and on a quarterly basis otherwise
Using a linear fit across all measurement points &#8594; should verify that each measurement point is within + 5% of the expected response.
Dose Calibrator Geometry
If the dose calibrator response using a particular source configuration exceeds + 5% of the reference configuration, a correction factor must be applied to all readings obtained using that particular source/activity geometry.

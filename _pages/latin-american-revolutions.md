title: "Latin American Revolutions"

Democratic and nationalistic revolutions, spread throughout North South America and lead by Simon Bolivar - gave independence to Venezuela, Bolivia, Peru, Columbia, Ecuador, Panama, for examples.

Series of risings in the Spanish colonies of Latin America (1810-1826) that established the independence of new states from
Spanish rule but that for the most part retained the
privileges of the elites despite efforts at more radical
social rebellion by the lower classes.

Orbital lymphoma&#8594; usually associated with systemic disease
Lacrimal gland is most common site of involvement (superolateral quadrant of orbit) &#8594; classic presentation of painless downward proptosis.
Hyperdense on CT (hypercellular), and hypointense on T1- and T2-weighted images.
Tends to mold to the globe (same with pseudotumor), while others may deform the globe.

Schwannoma/neurofibroma (indistinguishable)
Typically eccentric in the orbit (superiorly if V1)
Typically hypointense on T1, hyperintense on T2, and enhance.

Metastases&#8594; breast, lung, thyroid, RCC, and melanoma
Metastatic scirrhous breast cancer&#8594; can prevent exophthalmos or even cause frank enophthalmos due to fibrosis.
Neuroblastoma&#8594; sunburst-type periosteal reaction.

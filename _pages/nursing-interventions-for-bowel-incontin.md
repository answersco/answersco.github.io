1) Note when incontinence is most likely to occur, and place the patient on a bedpan at those times. If there is no pattern, offer a bedpan at regular intervals, such as every few hours.
2) Keep the skin clean and dry by using proper hygienic measures. Apply a protective skin barrier after cleaning the skin, according to manufacturer's directions. Impaired skin integrity may develop when such measures are overlooked.
3) Change bed linens and clothing as necessary to avoid odor, skin irritation, and embarrassment. Disposable bed pads and moisture-proof undergarments can be considered but should not be used until other measures have been tried. These materials often worsen any skin irritation or breakdown present as a result of skin contact with stool by retaining moisture against the skin, raising the pH of the skin, and prolonging contact of the stool against the skin, increasing damage from digestive enzymes present in the stool 
4) Confer with the physician about using a suppository or a daily cleansing enema. These measures empty the lower colon regularly and often help to decrease incontinence. Bowel-training programs may also be helpful.

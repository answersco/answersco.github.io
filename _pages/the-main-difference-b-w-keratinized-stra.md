title: "The main difference b/w keratinized stratified squamous layer and non-keratinized is that:  a) the cells in non-keratinized are likely to be flat and dead on the apical surface b) the cells in non-keratinized are likely to be dead on both apical and basement membrane c) the cells in non-keratinized won't be dead on the apical surface d) the cells in non-keratinized won't be dead on apical membrane but die at basal membrane"

title: "Fibrosing mediastinitis"
---
Classically caused by histo. Most are idiopathic. 
Other causes: TB, XRT, sarcoidosis.

Soft-tissue mass with calcifications infiltrating normal fat planes.
May cause SVC syndrome.
Associated with retroperitoneal fibrosis when idiopathic.

Fibrosing mediastinitis (WHO group 5, postcapillary):
Progressive proliferation of fibrous tissue within the mediastinum may lead to encasement and compression of mediastinal structures, most commonly secondary to histoplasmosis and TB.
May also encase the PAs, creating a pre-capillary pulmonary HTN.
Imaging features include &#8593; mediastinal soft tissue, often with calcified LNs due to prior granulomatous infection.

This is going to be fibrotic reaction int hemiddle mediastinum
Appearance: looks like soft tissue with calcifications
Most common cause is histoplasmosis however radiation, TB, and sarcoid can also cause 
Known to cause superior venacava syndrome

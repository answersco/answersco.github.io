title: "If you see a vascular lesion with prominent flow voids, is it an AVM or cavernoma?"

AVM!

AVM = The tightly packed, curvilinear flow voids (bag of black worms) with corresponding enhancement on MR is diagnostic. AVM REPLACES rather than DISPLACES brain.
- look for promient flow voids; may have hterogeneous signal from blood products
- Surrounding brain gliosis (T2 bright), dystrphic calcs, and blood products blooming on T2* GRE
- minimal mass effect becuase it replaces brain parenchyma

Cavernoma = A cavernoma has a mixed signal core (&quot;popcorn-like&quot; appearance) with a Peripheral rim of Hemosiderin.
* NO FLOW VOIDS or ENHANCEMENT!

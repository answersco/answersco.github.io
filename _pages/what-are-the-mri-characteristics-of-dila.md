title: "What are the MRI characteristics of dilated cardiomyopathies? How does DHE help differentiate?"
---
1) impaired wall thickening on cine
2) dilation of heart chambers
3) Global enhancement on first pass T1 C+

Old infarcts demonstrate DHE in a coronary distribution. 

DHE may or may not be present in dilated cardiomyopathies, but when present it involves the subepicardium or mid-myocardium as opposed to the subendocardium.

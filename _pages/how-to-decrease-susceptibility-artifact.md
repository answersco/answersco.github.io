title: "How to decrease susceptibility artifact?"
---
Susceptibility artifact due to metallic artifact can be reduced by increasing bandwidth, orienting the frequency encoding direction parallel to the long axis of the metal, 
<b> increasing the field of view, decreasing the voxel size, and maximizing the echo train length. </b> Decreasing slice thickness and echo time will also help.

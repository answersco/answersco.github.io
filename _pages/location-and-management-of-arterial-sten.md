title: "Location and management of arterial stenosis in kidney transplant"
---
Stenoses can occur at any point in the arterial inflow to the kidney, including the CIA.
Transplant RAS usually occurs at surgical anastomosis.
Focal web-like stenoses adjacent to the anastomosis are typically hypervascular lesions related to intraoperative clamps.
Extensive intrarenal arterial stenoses are seen in chronic rejection, poorly controlled HTN, DM, or AS.

Angioplasty with or without stenting of transplant renal arteries has high success rate.

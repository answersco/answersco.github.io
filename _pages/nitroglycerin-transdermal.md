title: "Nitroglycerin transdermal"
---
CLASSIFICATION: vasodilator, nitrate

INDICATIONS FOR USE: prevent anginal attacks, HTN from surgery, HF after MI, and angina, produces controlled hypotension during surgery

ACTION: reduces cardiac O2 demand by decreasing preload, increases blood flow through coronary vessels, vasodilations, and allows for increased activity tolerance

SIDE EFFECTS: dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, headaches

THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS: dilates coronary arteries, prevents angina, hypotension, vasodilator potent

NURSING ASSESSMENT:

WHAT TO MONITOR: monitor vitals especially BP, may cause headaches, remove patch before defibrillation, make sure they are only wearing one patch at a time

PT TEACHING: take regularly and do not stop abruptly, dispose of patches carefully, rotate patch sites and always remove last patch before putting the next scheduled dose on, avoid alcohol, light degrades medication 

EVALUATION: decreases in frequency and severity of angina attacks, increase in activity tolerance, controlled hypotension during procedures, treatment of HF from MI, and monitor BP and pulse

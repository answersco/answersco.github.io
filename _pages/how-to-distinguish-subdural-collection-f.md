title: "How to distinguish subdural collection from BESSI (Benign enlargement of subarachnoid space in infancy)?"
---
Look at the cortical veins, which will be adjacent to the inner table in BESSI and displaced away from the inner table in a subdural collection

* e.g. look for presence of &quot;BRIDGING VEINS&quot; that traverse the subarachnoid space (by CT/US/MRI) in BESSI

title: "RCA process and pitfalls"

Process: RCA should generally follow a pre-specified protocol
Begins with data collection and reconstruction of the event through record review and participant interviews.
Multidisciplinary team should then analyze the sequence of events leading to the error with goals of identifying how it occurred (through identification of active errors) and why it occurred (through identification and analysis of latent errors).
&quot;Quick fix&quot; may be implemented early in the process to rapidly reduce the risk of another similar error, even though it may not address the root cause.

RCA can be misleading since many adverse events actually have more than one &quot;root cause&quot;
As illustrated by the Swiss cheese model, multiple errors and system flaws often must intersect for a critical incident to reach a patient.
Labeling one or several factors as &quot;causes&quot; may place undue emphasis on specific factors rather than their relationships and other aspects of system design.

title: "What does &quot;peripheral&quot; cholangiocarcinoma mean?"
---
The term &quot;peripheral&quot; is potentially confusing, as the tumor lies deep within the liver. This term indicates that the tumor arose from a bile duct within the liver parenchyma, rather than at the biliary confluence (Klatskin tumor) or extrahepatic bile duct.

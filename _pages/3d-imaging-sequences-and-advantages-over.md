3D imaging sequences
Thick (3D) &quot;slab&quot; is excited.
The excitation does not localize tissue very well because of slab thickness.
Phase and frequency encoding proceed in slab&#8594; providing tissue localization in 3D.
Frequency encoding&#8594; localizes tissue along one axis.
Phase-encoding&#8594; occurs along two axes perpendicular to frequency-encode.
Phase encoding along first axis&#8594; behaves like 2D phase encoding across the slab face.
Phase encoding along 2nd axis&#8594; behaves like 2D phase encoding along slab length.
Advantages&#8594; 
Smaller voxels possible with good signal-to-noise (e.g. MRA)
Voxels with equal dimensions possible, for post-acquisition image reformatting.
Artifacts that appear predominantly along the phase-encode axis (e.g. flow artifacts, aliasing) &#8594; can appear along 2 different axes in 3D imaging sequences, instead of one axis in 2D imaging.

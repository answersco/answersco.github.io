---
Cervical carcinoma: 3rd most common gynecologic malignancy
Cervical mass &gt; 1.5 cm should be evaluated with MRI for staging
Key landmark for staging: cervical stroma
If the tumor extends through the cervical stroma into the parametrium&#8594; the tumor is stage IIB, and treatment is typically non-surgical
Other key findings are involvement of bladder or rectum&#8594; denotes stage IV disease (if shown to extend to mucosal surface).
Staging: FIGO criteria
Stage I: confined to cervix or uterus
IA: microscopic lesion
IB: clinically visible
Stage IIA: spread to upper &#8532; of vagina without parametrial invasion&#8594; typically managed surgically
Stage IIB: parametrial invasion&#8594; typically nonsurgical
Stage IIIA: spread to lower vagina
Stage IIIB: pelvic sidewall extension, hydronephrosis, or pelvic nodal involvement.
Stage IVA: spread to bladder and rectum
Stage IVB: distant metastases

title: "Differences between bicornuate uterus and septate uterus (3)"
---
Bicornuate uterus:
- &quot;Heart shaped&quot;: fundal contour (outside of uterus) is LESS than 5mm above tubal ostia
- no infertility issues
- resection of &quot;septum&quot; has poor outcomes

Septate Uterus:
- Fundal contour is NORMAL (more than 5mm above tubal ostia)
- Infertility issues common
- Resection of septum will help

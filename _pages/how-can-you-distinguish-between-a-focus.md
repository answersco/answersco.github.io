title: "How can you distinguish between a focus of high activity in the lumbar region pelvis as a traumatic LP causing CSF leakage and a true CSF leak on In-111 DTPA study?"

If the tracer accumulation is only seen at the 24 hour imaging, and NOT the immediate or 4 hour imaging, then it's likely a true CSF leak. A leak 2/2 traumatic LP would be seen on immediate and 4 hour delayed images.

title: "C5-C6 exiting nerve root vs descending nerve root example:"
---
In the Cervical Spine, the C1 nerve root exits ABOVE C1
- Therefore the EXITING NERVE ROOT IS THE SECOND NUMBER

- Ex) At C5-6, the C6 root exits laterally so it's compressed by a foraminal disc protrusion at this level

- At C5-C6, The C7 root is descending and will be smashed by a pracentral or centrla disc protrusion

title: "In-111 labeled WBC"
---
- Dose - 0.5 - 1 mCi of labeled WBCs; imaging performed 24 h
- Action - 
- Normal uptake - bone, spleen greater than liver, nothing else (essentially no normal uptake in the kidneys or bowel)
o In the first few hours, before the normal imaging time, there is uptake in the lungs and blood pool, as well as the liver and spleen. By 18 hours, there should no longer be blood pool or lung activity, and activity is now noted in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow
- Uses - infection imaging, FUO; good for abdominal, graft, and MSK infection with underlying prosthesis
o Preferred imaging for abdominal infection due to the lack of renal or GI uptake
o Not useful for parasitic or viral infxn (majority of labeled WBCs are neutrophils)
o Low sensitivity for spinal infection
o If you see uptake consistent with a graft infection, the management is antibiotics and surgery
Labeling - WBCs are removed first by sedimentation (RBCs sink to the bottom); then they are labeled

CRITOE
Capitellum - 1 yo
Radial head - 3 yo
internal (medial epicondyle) - 5 yo
Trochlea - 7 yo
Olecranon - 9 yo
External (lateral epicondyle) - 11 yo


Medial epicondyle is an EXTRA-ARTICULAR structure and therefore will not all the time cause an effusion.
Little league elbow: this is a medial epicondyle avulsion. The fragment can get stuck between the articular surface of theh humerus and olecronon.

CrIToe: You should never see the trochlea and NOT see the medial epicondyle. If you see the trochlea and NOT the medial epi then this probably represent a fracture fragment.

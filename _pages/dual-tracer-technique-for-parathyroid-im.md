title: "Dual tracer technique for parathyroid imaging"
---
1st agent: goes to both thyroid and parathyroid
-Tc99m-sestamibi or 201-thallium chloride

2nd agent: only goes to thryoid
-I-123 or pertechnetate

Subtraction: anything hot on these images could be a parathyroid adenoma

Problems:
Motion: limits subtraction imaging
Interference with thyroid tracer (e.g. recent IV contrast).

title: "How are the monomers made into polymers?"
---
dehydration synthesis: one OH- group is removed from one monomer and a H+ group is removed from another to form water as a by-product
-the two monomers are then joined by a covalent bond
-this is repeated for each monomer added to the chain until you get a polymer if long enough

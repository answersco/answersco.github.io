title: "RadLex and potential benefits:"
---
RadLex: created by RSNA to approach the need for a more generalized lexicon to report imaging findings across multiple modalities and organ systems.
RadLex: described as &quot;a single unified source of radiology terms.&quot;

RSNA also established a &quot;Reporting Initiative&quot; with the goal to &quot;create an online library of best-practices radiology report templates for key clinical scenarios.&quot;
Based on standard terminology, including RadLex
Could be adapted by radiology practices based on local practice patterns

Potential benefits of structured reporting and standardized lexicon:
Standardization of reports among radiologists, which could improve satisfaction of referring clinicians and better understanding of reports
Radiologists may be less likely to overlook findings if the structure of the report improves their search pattern and report completeness
May facilitate easier data mining for quality monitoring and research
May facilitate accurate billing and easier searching for relevant information
May interface well with a speech recognition system and improve productivity.

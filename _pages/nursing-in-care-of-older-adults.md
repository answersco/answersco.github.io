title: "Nursing in care of older adults"
---
-all nurses in adult settings will care for older adults

1) Functional assessment is common framework for assessment b/c functional decline is a common complication of hospitalized adults
-debility: rehab diagnosis for older adults after hospitalization who need work to regain some muscle and strength
-poor long-term outcomes b/c they are likely to not to be discharged home but to nursing homes which means longer recovery and associated healthcare costs
-loss of physical function can often lead to immobility which can cause infections, falls, pressure ulcers, etc

2) Goals: sustain maximum functional levels (in order to do this, we have to know baseline functional levels), prevent complications, maximize quality of life
-baseline function: ask ADL's/IADL's they perform on their own
-keep them active as you can

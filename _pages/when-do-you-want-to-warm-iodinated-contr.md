title: "When do you want to warm iodinated contrast to body temperature?"
---
Extrinsic warming of iodinated contrast material to human body temperature (37&#176;C) may be helpful to minimize complications and improve vascular opacification in the following circumstances: For high-rate (&gt; 5 mL/second) IV LOCM power injections. For injections of viscous iodinated contrast (e.g., iopamidol 370, and presumably other contrast media with a similar or higher viscosity). For direct arterial injections through small-caliber catheters (5 French or smaller). For intravenously injected arterial studies in which timing and peak enhancement are critical features.

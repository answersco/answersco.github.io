title: "MRI enhancement patterns:"
---
Homogeneous internal enhancement&#8594; uniform, suggestive of a benign lesion

Heterogeneous internal enhancement&#8594; non-uniform enhancement within the lesion, and is suspicious (especially in presence of rim enhancement)

Rim enhancement&#8594; highly suspicious for cancer (up to 84% of cases), though the finding is seen in only 16% of cancers
Other causes of rim enhancement:
Peripherally enhancing inflammatory cyst (water signal on T1 and T2 with diagnostic US appearance)
Fat necrosis&#8594; central high signal on non-fat-suppressed T1W images and characteristic MM appearance

Enhancing internal septations and central enhancement&#8594; also suspicious for malignancy, though less common than rim enhancement.
Enhancing internal septations has &gt; 95% PPV for malignancy.

Dark internal septations&#8594; highly specific for fibroadenoma (&gt;95% PPV)

Post-surgical enhancement
Following lumpectomy&#8594; normal enhancement at the lumpectomy site can be seen for up to 6-18 months due to granulation tissue

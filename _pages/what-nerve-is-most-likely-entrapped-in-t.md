title: "What nerve is most likely entrapped in the setting of forearm pain with weakness of the extensors and preserved sensation?"
---
Answer: posterior interosseous nerve

Posterior interosseous nerve syndrome is also known as deep radial nerve syndrome and supinator syndrome. 
Posterior interosseous nerve syndrome (PIN) presents with forearm pain, a nonspecific symptom. Some patients complain of weakness of the extensor muscles. 
Sensation is usually preserved. 

Posterior interosseous nerve syndrome is the result of radial nerve entrapment or compression at the supinator muscle. 

MRI typically shows denervation edema or atrophy of the involved muscles with sparing of the extensor carpi radialis longus. The most common site of nerve compression is the arcade of Frohse at the proximal edge of the supinator muscle.

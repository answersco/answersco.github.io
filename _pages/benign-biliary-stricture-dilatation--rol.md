title: "Benign biliary stricture dilatation: role of stenting after initial dilatation"
---
Role of long-term stenting of the dilated stricture is controversial. Some advocate leaving a long-term stent across the anastomosis for 6-12 months
-Authors (Requisites) prefer to leave a 10-12 Fr soft catheter (Cope Loop, Cook) across the stricture/anastomosis for 3-4 weeks. The patient returns for cholangiogram. If anastomosis appears widely patient, the catheter is removed. If anastomosis isn't patent, balloon dilatation is repeated and the catheter left for another 3-4 weeks.

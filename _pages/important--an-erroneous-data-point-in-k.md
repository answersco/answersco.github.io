title: "IMPORTANT: An erroneous data point in k-space can cause banding. How can you tell where the error is based on the band pattern?"
---
The closer the error to the center of k-space (low spatial frequencies), the FARTHER the bands are apart.

- An x-axis error causes vertical lines (perpendicular to the error)

- A y-axis error causes horizontal lines (perpendicular to the error)

* If the bands are slanted, it's an error off the 2 axes

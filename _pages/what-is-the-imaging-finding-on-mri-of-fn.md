title: "What is the imaging finding on MRI of FNH?"
---
Isointensity to (normal) liver on T1- and T2WI and bright uniform enhancement on arterial phase imaging. A central scar is often seen in larger lesions and is typically hyperintense on T2- and hypointense on T1WI with delayed, persistent enhancement of the scar, indicating its fibrous nature.

(Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinomas are usually larger and more heterogeneous with signs of invasiveness and metastases at the time of diagnosis.)

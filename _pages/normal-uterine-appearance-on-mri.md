title: "Normal uterine appearance on MRI:"

Uterine anatomy: T2W MRI can distinguish the 3 layers of the uterus
Endometrial stripe: hyperintense on T2
Junctional zone (1st zone of myometrium): T2 hypointense 
Should measure &lt; 12 mm: thickening is seen in adenomyosis
Outer myometrium: relatively T2-hypointense, though less so than the junctional zone.

title: "New Jersey Plan"
---
A proposal submitted by the New Jersey Delegation that also introduced the three branches, wanted to have equal representation for all states.

Opposite of the Virginia Plan, it proposed a single house in congress in which each state had one vote. This created a conflict with representation between bigger states, who wanted control befitting their population, and smaller states, who didn't want to be bullied by larger states.

a framework for the Constitution proposed by a group of small states; its key points were a one-house legislature with one vote for each state, a Congress with the ability to raise revenue, and a Supreme Court with members appointed for life

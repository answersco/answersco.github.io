Colloid nodules: suspicious features include microcalcifications, increased vascularity, solid size (&gt; 1.5 cm), and cold on uptake scan.
&quot;Comet tail&quot; artifact

Adenoma: look like solid colloid nodules
Hyperfunctioning nodules- hot on uptake scan, usually with colder background thyroid.

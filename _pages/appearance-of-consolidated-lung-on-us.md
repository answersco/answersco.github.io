lung consolidation is so-called &quot;hepatization&quot; by pathologists because the alveoli are filled with cellular debris and the lung resembles a solid organ like liver; consolidated lung resembles liver on ultrasound as well and containing branching bright lines (equivalent to air bronchograms on CXR).

title: "RA in spine:"
---
Thoracic and lumbar spine almost never involved.
Cervical spine&#8594; involved in up to 70% of patients, with involvement increased with more severe and long-standing disease.
General pattern includes subluxation at multiple levels, osteopenia, and erosions of the odontoid, facet joints, vertebral endplates, and spinous processes.
Unlike OA, there is no bone production.
Atlantoaxial subluxation in RA:
Characteristic finding is atlantoaxial (C1-C2) subluxation. 
May occur in any directions, including anterior (most common), posterior, vertical (atlantoaxial impaction), rotatory, and lateral.
Caused by inflammation of adjacent bursa and resultant laxity of the transverse ligament.

title: "Normal anatomy of right pulmonary arteries"
---
Right main PA branches first into upper and lower trunks, and then into segmental vessels that roughly follow the bronchial segments.
Beyond this, the PA anatomy becomes extremely variable.
Common variants of RPA include accessory branch to the posterior segment of the upper lobe from the lower trunk, and 2 arteries to the RML.

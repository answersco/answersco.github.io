1) bleeding (usually first seen from IV site, wounds, gums )
2) thrombocytopenia (low platelets)
3) HIT (Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia) - when you have to intervene bc they are having negative reaction from heparin, usually need a transfusion, heparin needs stopped, and another medication is given

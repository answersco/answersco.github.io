title: "What are the 4 stages of neurocysticercosis and what do they look like?"
---
1) Vesicular: thin walled cysts, no edema
2) Colloidal: hyperdense, ring-enhancing cysts, edema
3) Granular: involuting cyst, thick walls, less edema
4) Nodular calcified: calcifications, no edema

&quot;Very Carefully Grown Neurocysticercosis&quot;

1. Vesicular (thin walled cyst = no edema)
2. Colloidal (T1/T2 bright + thick wall, massive edema)
3. Granular (shrunken cyst; thicker wall; less edema)
4. Nodular (Small calcified lesion w/o edema)

* look for the scolex!

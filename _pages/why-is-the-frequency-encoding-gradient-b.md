title: "Why is the frequency encoding gradient bilobed?"
---
The frequency encoding gradient is a bilobed gradientin spin-echo and gradient echo sequences. The 1st part introduces a phase shift that is then refocused by the following opposite part of the gradient during which readout occurs. The preparation part leads to gradient refocusing during the readout (no phase shift in the center of k-space).

-DSA aortogram in AP projection with pigtail catheter positioned in transverse arch and injection of 20-30 mL/sec for 2 seconds allows rapid identification of the enlarged, tortuous bronchial arteries.
-Arteries can then be selected with 5-French catheters using a variety of shapes, such as Cobra-2, Simmons-1, and Shepherd's crook.

In patients with chronic pulmonary inflammatory processes, multiple selective injections looking for potential collaterals, such as internal mammary and other subclavian artery branches, should be performed.

title: "With loosening of hip prosthesis, where's the uptake most likely going to be?"

Along stem and lesser trochanter - but this is still very NON SPECIFIC.

- Combined Sulfur colloid and WBC imaging needed. Look for positive on all 3 phases but negative on WBC imaging (no actual infection if just plain loosening)

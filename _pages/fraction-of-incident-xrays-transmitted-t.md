title: "Fraction of incident xrays transmitted through the patient   = e^(-u)(x)   *x = thickness of the material   *u = attenuation coefficient (tissue specific)  Product of (u * x) is the same for all the answers-&gt; all have the same attenuation"
---
Which material listed below has the greatest XRAY ATTENUATION (beam energy kept constant)???

a. FAT (2.5 cm thick) &amp; attenuation coefficient of 0.2

b. BONE (1 cm thick) &amp; attenuation coefficient of 0.5

c. WATER (2 cm thick) with an attenuation coefficient of 0.25

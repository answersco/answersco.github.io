title: "Tc 99"
---
Tc t1/2 = 6 hours
Process of making: Precursor is Mo99 (t1/2 67 hrs), elute off the degraded tech (from the almuminum coil w/ water), then reduce with stannous ion (as the tc-99 that just came off with the water is +7 valence)

Steps of testing to make sure you have the right product:
1. Radionuclide purity test - Looking for various photopeaks of the different radionuclides
2. Chemical purity test - This test is to make sure that none of the aluminum came off (do this w/ pH paper)
3. Radiochemical test - making sure you have the right separation after reducing with stannous ion

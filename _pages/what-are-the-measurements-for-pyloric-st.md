title: "What are the measurements for pyloric stenosis? How to find by US?"
---
Muscular wall thickness &gt; 3 mm, and/or pyloric length &gt; 16 mm

- When measuring wall, do NOT include echogenic mucosal layer OR serosal layer!! (Measure only outer edge to inner edge muscular wall)

- Localize by using the gallbladder!

- if borderline, e.g. don't see food moving into duodenum from stomach, then repeat US in 1-3 days

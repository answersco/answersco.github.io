How did you start with a simple structure to a complex cell with many internal organelles?
1) Two different size simple cells -- a larger and smaller
2) The larger cell engulfs and takes in the smaller cell
3) The smaller one survives and remains surrounded by the vacuolar membrane
4) Smaller bacterium becomes a permanent resident of its host cytoplasm, it multiplies and is passed on during cell division. It utilizes aerobic metabolism and increases energy and availability for its host
5) Ancentral eukaryotic cell develops additional membrane pouches that becomes the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi
6) Photosynthetic bacteria are also engulfed and they develop the chloroplasts

Nonspecific &quot;degenerative&quot; and FMD-related aneurysms: typically located at extraparenchymal locations and bifurcations of 1st and 2nd order renal artery branches in 90%

Aneurysms due to vasculitis (e.g. PAN) or hematogenously disseminated infection occur in the peripheral intraparenchymal renal branches.

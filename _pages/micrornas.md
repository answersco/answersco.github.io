title: "MicroRNAs"
---
-prevent translation
-noncoding RNAs 
-21-22 bases long
-we have ~1,000 distinct microRNAs
-regulate 1/3 of the protein-encoding genes - regulates protein's being made
-when a microRNA binds to a &quot;target&quot; mRNA, it prevents translation by complementary base pairing with mRNA b/c it is not single-stranded.
-they act post-transcription and prevent translation of some mRNAs into protein

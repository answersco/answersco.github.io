title: "What determines the precision of the ADC conversion process?"
---
Sampling bit depth.
Specifies the # of bits used to store the digital values of the sampled signal.
This precision is often referred to as &quot;quantization error,&quot; since all analog values are rounded off to integer values with this accuracy.
All MRI ADC systems have sampling bit depth between 12 and 16 bits.
Inadequate bit depth&#8594; obliterates much of the information about image details (mostly residing in the very low strength part of the signal) by introducing quantization round-off errors&#8594; images appear less sharp.

title: "WHO classification of pulmonary HTN:"
---
Group 1: pulmonary arterial HTN (PAH)
Primary pulmonary HTN (PPH): idiopathic or familial
Congenital left-to-right shunts, such as ASD and VSD, may cause PAH and shunt reversal (Eisenmenger syndrome)
PAH may be caused by pulmonary venous or capillary involvement, such as pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Typically enlargement of main PAs with rapidly-tapering peripheral vessels.

Group 2: pulmonary venous HTN:
Left-sided heart disease (LA, LV, or mitral/aortic valve disease) may cause &#8593; PV pressure in chronic disease. Similar imaging to that of PPH, with enlarged central and main PAs with peripheral tapering.

Group 3: pulmonary HTN associated with chronic hypoxemia
COPD, interstitial lung disease, and sleep apnea can cause pulmonary HTN in chronic disease.
Group 4: pulmonary HTN due to chronic thromboembolic disease
Group 5: pulmonary HTN due to miscellaneous disorders
Sarcoidosis
Compression of pulmonary vessels, which can be due to neoplasm, fibrosing mediastinitis, etc.

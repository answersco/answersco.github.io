title: "Neurologic control of ventilation"
---
-Resting respiration cyclic and excitation of phrenic nerve

-Mechanisms work to match CO2 removal &amp; supply of O2 received for metabolic needs

1) Central Nervous System - respiratory centers in the medulla, pons, cortex
-Chemoreceptors respond to pH changes 
-if pH too acidic, PCO2 increases; breathe faster to compensate 

2) Peripheral control -- chemoreceptors respond to pH changes
-Increased CO2 levels = &#8595; pH
-Increased levels of CO2 in arterial blood is major stimulus to increase ventilation
-Decreased O2 (hypoxia) &lt; 70 mm Hg

3) Baroreceptors are in aortic arch and carotid arties that can increase/decrease depending on arterial pressure

Binning: takes several detector elements (DELs) to make a large DEL (only with FPD, not II)
Concept:
&#8595; the amount of data &#8594; &#8595; variation in x-ray photons from pixel to pixel and &#8595; quantum mottle
With &#8595; mottle, you can &#8595; radiation and keep the same noise
Larger DEL does &#8595; spatial resolution
Binning is especially useful with large FOV (where there are too many pixels in the image)

Binning and spatial resolution:
-Binning: large FOV will have lower spatial resolution (but can use less radiation to maintain the noise level)
-No binning: spatial resolution doesn't change with different fields of view.
Small FOV: dose is increased to reduce quantum mottle

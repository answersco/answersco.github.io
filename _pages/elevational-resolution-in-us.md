Elevational resolution (slice-thickness): same as lateral resolution but measured in a plane orthogonal to the image plane &#8594; Depends on transducer element height
Associated with volume averaging in regions close to the transducer and in the far-field

Elevational resolution (slice-thickness): same as lateral resolution but measured in a plane orthogonal to the image plane &#8594; Depends on transducer element height
Associated with volume averaging in regions close to the transducer and in the far-field

Improved by:
-Using a fixed focal length across the entire surface of the array (downside is partial volume effects).
-Minimizing slice thickness- done by phase excitation of the outer to inner arrays.

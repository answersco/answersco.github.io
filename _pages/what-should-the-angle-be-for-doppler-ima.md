title: "What should the angle be for Doppler imaging?"
---
Doppler angle should be 30-60 based on formula for calculating it using cosine of the angle
Cos 90 = 0; Cos 0 = 1

Why &gt; 30 rather than 0 degree angle?
-Angles &lt; 20 degrees can cause refraction and loss of signal
-Aliasing also becomes an issue

Why not perpendicular?
-If you placed the probe perpendicular to the vessel, it can give false impression of now flow (occlusion)
-I can also create a mirror image.

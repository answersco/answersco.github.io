title: "What is the use of inversion recovery (IR) in cardiac imaging?"
---
The goal is to null the signal from normal myocardium to demonstrate delayed enhancement, if present. The nulled normal myocardium will be dark in contrast to the enhanced abnormal myocardium. IR pulses have a special parameter known as inversion time (TI) when the mycardium is dark (usually at 330 ms after the RF pulse) and it varies from person to person. The TI can be identified by using a TI scout sequence or the new Phase Sensitive Inversion Recovery (PSIR) sequence.

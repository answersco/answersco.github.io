-located: osteoblasts in bone
-function: decrease blood calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclasts

-secreted by C cells (clear cells) of thyroid gland when blood calcium levels rise too high
-lowers blood calcium concentration in two ways
1) inhibits osteoclasts: stop bone reabsorption

2) stimulates osteoblasts: to deposit more calcium to be deposited into bone
-weak effects in adults and more important for kids
-osteoclasts in kids tend to be more active so it is imperative so their bones don't grow out of control
-may help pregnant lactating women to minimize calcium loss

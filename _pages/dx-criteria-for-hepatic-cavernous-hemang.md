* Mass with nodular peripheral enhancement; very hyperintense on T2WI
* Arterial phase: Early peripheral, nodular or globular, discontinuous enhancement.

*Typical: 2-10 cm in diameter. Small hemangiomas (&quot;capillary&quot;): &lt; 2 cm; often &quot;flash-filling&quot;
* Giant: &gt; 10 cm in diameter. Venous and delayed phases: Incomplete centripetal filling of lesion (scar does not enhance)

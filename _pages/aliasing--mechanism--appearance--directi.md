Mechanism: Tissues outside FOV are artifactually recorded within FOV
Appearance: Overlay of anatomy; &quot;Zebra&quot; in GRE (Banding); Can be stacked wrap in 3D sequences
Direction: Phase encoding
Better: Increase FOV; Change direction of phase encoding (thinnest axis in phase encoding direction); Use spatial saturation bands
Worse: Smaller FOV

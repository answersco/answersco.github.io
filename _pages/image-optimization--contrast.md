title: "Image Optimization (Contrast)"

- primary enemy of contrast is SCATTER (you want to reduce scatter)
- Note: If you are imaging something with high intrinsic contrast you can increase the kVp more without losing contrast because you don't need to accentuate subtle contrast differences
- Note: remember, if you are ****ing with the kVp but wish to maintain a specific image density, you're going to need to adjust the mAs.
- Note: You can use a grid to increase contrast. Remember, grids are used for thicker body parts (not babies and feet) because thicker body parts have higher scatter. Also grids will be used when you are using a HIGH kVp given the increased scatter. Also remember that grids INCREASE dose.

-S/P Ratio: this is the ratio of secondary xrays hitting the detector vs. primary xrays hitting the detector. LOW s/p ratios are better.
- S/P Ratio determinates:
1. Thickness of the body part
2. AREA of the beam. 
BOTH of the above are going to INCREASE scatter and increase the S/P ratio (bad). Both of these essentially have to do with the fact that you are going to have MORE interactions.

Other ways of reducing scatter/increasing contrast:
1. Collimate: reduces the AREA of the beam
2. Compress part: this REDUCES THICKNESS
3. Lower kVp: Reduces number of compton interactions
4. Grid/Air gap: reduce the number of scattered photons.

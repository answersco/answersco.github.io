title: "RRNA"
---
-associates with proteins to form ribosomes, which structurally support and catalyze protein synthesis
-ribosomes have two subunits that join during protein synthesis (small &amp; large)
-provide structural support, catalyze peptide bonds (ribozymes) align ribosome and mRNA
~ 100 to 3,000 bases long

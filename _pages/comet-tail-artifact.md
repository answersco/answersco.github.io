title: "Comet Tail Artifact"
---
This is a type of reverberation artifact
The different between this and reverberation is that the objects are CLOSER than 1/2 the spatial pulse length therefore it more apperas as ONE structure

What causes:
-Adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder wall

Looks kinda like ring down but quickly tapers off (ring down extends to deep image). It is a type of reverb artifact

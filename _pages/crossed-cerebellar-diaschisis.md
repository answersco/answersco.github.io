title: "Crossed cerebellar diaschisis?"
---
Commonly encountered phenomenon in presence of a supratentorial lesion where cerebellar hemisphere contralateral to lesion shows decreased radiotracer uptake. Probably due to interuption of corticopontine-cerebellar pathways.

Commonly encountered in presence of supratentorial lesion (seen in tumors, stroke, and trauma), where the cerebellar hemisphere contralateral to the lesion shows decreased radiotracer uptake.

-Supratentorial insult (tumor resection, infarct, radiation) with decreased activity in contralateral cerebellar hemisphere

Depressed blood flow and metabolism involving a cerebellar hemisphere after a CONTRAlateral supratentorial insult

Radiotracers: Tc-99m-IDA agents (iminodiacetic acid analogs)
Disofenin&#8594; allows visualization of biliary system with bilirubin levels as high as 20 mg/dL, and has 90% hepatic uptake
Mebrofenin&#8594; allows visualization of biliary system with bilirubin levels as high as 30 mg/dL, and even higher (98%) hepatic uptake
Both actively transported into hepatocytes but aren't conjugated
Protocol:
Patient must be NPO for 6 hours prior to study, but must have eaten within 24 hours.
If patient has been NPO for &gt; 24 hours, CCK can be slowly infused to empty the gallbladder before radiotracer is administered.
One should wait at least 2 hours after CCK before beginning exam.
If gallbladder is not visualized within 1 hour, morphine can be given (0.04 mg/kg up to maximum dose of 4 kg) &#8594; imaging continued for 30 more minutes
Morphine contracts the sphincter of Oddi&#8594; redirects bile into the cystic duct
Should only be given if tracer is visualized in the small bowel due to theoretical risk of worsening a potential CBD obstruction
If allergic to morphine, can image for total of 4 hours

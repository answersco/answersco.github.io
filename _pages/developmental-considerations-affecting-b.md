title: "Developmental considerations affecting bowel elimination"
---
1) infants: characteristics of stool and frequency depend on formula or breast feedings.
-sphincters and nervous system are not mature yet
2) toddler: physiologic maturity is the first priority for bowel training (ability of nervous system and sphincters to become mature enough)/Voluntary bowel control between 22-36 months
3) child, adolescent, adult: defecation patterns vary in quantity, frequency, and rhythmicity. 1-2 / day to 1 every other 2-3 days
4) older adult: constipation is often a chronic problem; diarrhea and fecal incontinence may result from physiologic or lifestyle changes resulting in a decrease in motility

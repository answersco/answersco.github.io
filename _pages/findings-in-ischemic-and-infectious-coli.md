title: "Findings in ischemic and infectious colitis:"
---
schemic colitis: can be from acute arterial thrombus, chronic stenosis, low-flow states, or venous thrombosis
Splenic flexure is especially susceptible to ischemia in low-flow states
Rectum almost never affected: dual blood supply from superior rectal artery (terminal branch of IMA) and interior/middle rectal arteries (anterior division of internal iliac artery) form perirectal collaterals
Suggestive CT findings: segmental, continuous thickening of affected colon in vascular distribution, sparing the rectum.

Infectious colitis: features pericolonic stranding and ascites in addition to the colonic wall thickening seen in all forms of colitis
Yersinia, salmonella, and TB affect the right colon
TB affects the ileocecal valve&#8594; mimics Crohns
E coli, CMV, and c difficile: most commonly cause pancolitis

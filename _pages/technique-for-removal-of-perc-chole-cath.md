title: "Technique for removal of perc chole catheter"
---
Catheter is withdrawn over a guidewire and Kumpe catheter, or a 5-Fr dilator is placed over the guidewire into the opening of the perc track.
-Using a Tuohy-Borst adapter, CM is injected into the track.
-If the track is mature, CM will outline the track all the way to the GB. If it is immature, CM will spill into the peritoneal cavity, in which case the catheter is reinserted over the guidewire into the GB.
-Procedure is repeated at weekly intervals until the track is mature.

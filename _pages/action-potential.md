title: "Action potential"
---
-when the electrical signal is at rest, they are said to be polarized and ready to do
-at rest, the primary extracellular ions are sodium and calcium (hanging out outside of cell)
-at rest, the primary intracellular ions are potassium (hanging out inside of cell)
-there is very intricate movement between these ions to cause electrical conduction to happen
-based on this different movement of the different ions happening, causes the action to happen, and those specific ions are what will be targeted with medication to change problems with electrical conduction

-all or none firing
-all Na+ channels open
-once you reach threshold, this occurs
-longest signal from one place to another
-irreversible
-cannot stop it
-doesn't degrade
-use graded potentials to get there

-brief wave of positive electrical charge that sweeps down the axon to the terminal buttons
1) Na+ rushes in
2) K+ repelled by positively charged Na+ ions
3) K+ rushes out
-This process travels down the axon

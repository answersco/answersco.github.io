Insulinoma: most common pancreatic endocrine tumor, presenting with hypoglycemia&#8594; best prognosis due to early presentation.
Gastrinoma: causes hypersecretion of gastric acid&#8594; leads to ZES
2nd most common pancreatic endocrine tumor
Associated with MEN 1: when associated with MEN-1, gastrinomas tend to be multiple, and located in the duodenum rather than the pancreas.
Most frequently occur in gastrinoma triangle: bounded by junction of cystic duct and CBD, the duodenum inferiorly, and the neck/body of the pancreas medially.
High gastrin levels may cause formation of carcinoid tumors in the stomach&#8594; regress after gastrinoma resection.

title: "Duplicated aortic arches and other vascular rings"
---
Rare variant due to failure of regression of branchial arches on both sides
May be equal or disproportionate in size, with variable great-vessel branching pattern.
The arch segments arise from a single ascending aorta, pass lateral to both sides of trachea and esophagus, and join posteriorly to form the descending thoracic aorta
These account for over 40% of thoracic vascular rings, with symptoms due to compression of encircled trachea and esophagus

Other vascular rings include: right arch with left ligamentum arteriosum (25%), right arch with anomalous innominate artery (17%), and pulmonary artery sling (5%).

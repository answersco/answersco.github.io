title: "Dose calibrator"
---
what is this machine ?

Well counter (ion chamber) with readout. Readout has buttons specific to each RP. Ionizations are calibrated to specific isotopes.
Quality control constancy ( Cs 137 or Co 57) - daily, linearity - weekly, accuracy - upon installation and then annually, geometry - upon installation

ionization chamber
change the radionuclide setting bc doses are measured diff since diff current
checks: daily constancy, quarterly accuracy and linearity
(geometry after service, installation)

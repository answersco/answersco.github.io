title: "2D vs. 3D PET, and time-of-flight (TOF) PET"
---
Modern scanners are 3D: use incident time to exclude scatter
Older 2D scanners use septa to deal with scatter

TOF PET: by measuring the difference in arrival times between the 2 photons from an annihilation event, a TOF image can be created
-Can enhance spatial resolution and image contrast.

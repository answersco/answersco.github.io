Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy: represents fibrofatty replacement of ventricular myocytes, causing focal contraction abnormalities and/or aneurysm formation
Difficult diagnosis, usually depending on major and minor criteria from EKG, imaging, and biopsy findings (determined by task force).
Imaging plays a supportive role in diagnosis: may include RV enlargement or presence of focal aneurysm.
LV enlargement can be seen in up to 75% of patients.
Requires ICD placement once diagnosis is confirmed.

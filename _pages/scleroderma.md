hidebound (tightly packed folds ), anti-mesent tic

Mild dilated esophagus
open GE junction (may stricture late from reflux)
Primary contractions in proximal third, then tertiary contractions in distal 2/3
**reflux!

esophagus &gt; small bowel &gt; colon &gt; stomach
Dilation of bowel loops with hypomotility
mucosal folds are tight and close together (hidebound)

-hidebound bowel appearance with close folds
-sacculations on antimesenteric border

May also be shown as dilated esophagus
LES is incompetent; can lead to sequela of reflux (stricture, Barrett's, CA)

Lung NSIP w/ subpleural sparing

Sm Bowel: closely-spaced valvulae conniventes-hide-bound. Disproportionate dilatation of duodenum.

May also be shown as dilated esophagus
LES is incompetent- can lead to scarring, Barrett's, and cancer.
May show lung changes of NSIP with subpleural sparing
SB: closely-spaced valvulae conniventes-hide-bound.
Disproportionate dilatation of duodenum.

(not NSIP) - dilated edophagus and cystic/fibrotic lung bases

resorption of the distal radius or first MT, soft tissue calcs.

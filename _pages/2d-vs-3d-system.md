title: "2D vs 3D system"

2D system: uses lead (or tungsten)
3D system: does NOT use a septa which increases sensitivity but also probably decreases spatial resolution. This is going to be used in times where you have small objects (PEDS) as this allows you to decrease the dose because of the increased sensitivity vs. a 2D system.

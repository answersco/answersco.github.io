title: "How to reduce Aliasing?"
---
Aliasing can be reduced or eliminated by
1) adjusting the scale (which increases the PRF)
2) selecting a lower frequency transducer (which decreases Doppler shift)
3) selecting a sample volume at a lesser depth (PRF increases as depth decreases)
4) choosing a Doppler angle closer to 90&#176; (decreases Doppler shift)

title: "Why excess neutrons in stable atoms at higher Z?"
---
The excess of N for heavy nuclides can be explained as follows. There are both attractive nuclear force and repulsive electric force between Z whereas only attractive nuclear force exists between N as well as between Z and N. With increased number of Z in a heavy nucleus, the repulsive force grows stronger. To overcome the stronger repulsive force, an excess of N is needed to provide stronger attractive force so that the nucleus remains stable.

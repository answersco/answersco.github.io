PAs are end arteries- few intrapulmonary anastomoses
-Acute proximal occlusion of a normal PA segment usually results in distal lung infarction.

Congenital proximal PA obstruction relieved by flow through PDA, or bronchial and other mediastinal arteries.

Adults with longstanding acquired PA occlusion- may have reconstitution of peripheral PAs by small distal intrapulmonary collaterals.

Bronchial arteries can provide collateral supply to the lung parenchyma and PAs.

When systemic arteries provide substantial collateral flow to PAs, a left-to-right shunt may develop.

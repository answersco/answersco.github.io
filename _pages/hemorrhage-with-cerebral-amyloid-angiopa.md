Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) &#8594; normotensive elderly adult patient
Primary feature to suggest CAA is location&#8594; almost always lobar or cortical, usually in the parietal or occipital lobes.
Multiple microhemorrhages on T2* (GRE or SWI) within the brain parenchyma, and are cortical, unlike basal ganglia hemorrhage seen with HTN.

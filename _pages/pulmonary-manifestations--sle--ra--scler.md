SLE: more common pleural and pericardial effusions than others.
-Fibrosis is uncommon
-May have &quot;shrinking lung&quot; - progressive volume loss

RA: looks like UIP and COP, and favors lower lobes
-Reticulations +/- honeycombing
-Consolidative opacities, representing organizing PNA
-Caplan syndrome: RA + upper lobe predominant lung nodules, which can cavitate, and may have pleural effusion.

Scleroderma: NSIP &gt; UIP
Lower-lobe predominant
Dilated esophagus with fluid.

Sjogren's: LIP
-Extensive GG attenuation with scattered thin-walled cysts

AS: UPPER LOBE fibrobullous disease
-Usually unilateral first, progressing to bilateral.

SLE: more common pleural and pericardial EFFUSIONS than others.
-Fibrosis is uncommon
-May have &quot;shrinking lung&quot; - progressive volume loss from diaphragm dysfunction or pain

RA: looks like UIP and COP, and favors LOWER LOBES
-Reticulations +/- honeycombing
-Consolidative opacities, representing organizing PNA
-Caplan syndrome: RA +UPPER lobe predominant lung nodules, which can cavitate, and may have pleural effusion.

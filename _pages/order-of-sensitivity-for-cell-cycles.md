title: "Order of sensitivity for cell cycles"

M &gt; G2 &gt; G1 &gt; S

G1 is the part of cycle that is most variable in length (shorter in cells with high turnover).
Surviving cell synchronization: if you irradiate cells, the ones that survive will have synchronized cell cycles.
-This is because they are most resistant in late synthesis, so most surviving cells are in this stage.

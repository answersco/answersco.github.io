1) Troponin binds to Ca2+ just released

2) Troponin/tropomyosin rolls and exposes active sites on actin which means myosin now has a place to bind to

3) ATP is hydrolized to ADP + P which provides the energy to &quot;cock&quot; myosin head into position (if ATP is gone, it will not &quot;cock&quot; but stays limb

4) Myosin still bound to ADP/P and forms a crossbridge w/ actin

5) Myosin releases ADP/P &amp; myosin head fires producing a powerstroke

6) A new ATP binds myosin, causing myosin to detach from actin and breaks crossbridges

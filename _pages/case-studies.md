-in depth study of a single object or small group of subjects
EX. HM: epilepsy in hippocampus so they removed it resulting in no new memories, only memories up to the day of surgery so we use him b/c he has a rare impairment resulting in us learning about the hippocampus and memory
-Problems: only one person so is everybody different or does he represent the whole population
EX. bad speller = no hippocampus or naturally bad speller?

Coherent scattering (Rayleigh scattering): 
Photon excites the entire atom &#8594; Eventually de-excites&#8594; photon emitted with same energy but different direction from original photon
If these photons reach image receptor they can cause some loss in contrast
Coherent scattering does NOT result in ionization
No net transfer of energy
No dose to patient
No generation of x-rays
Seen primarily at low energies (i.e. mammo) &#8594; wastes about 15% of photon interaction below 30 keV

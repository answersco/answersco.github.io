title: "Spatial resolution and sensitivity in PET"
---
Depends on detector resolution and positron range/angulation
Range: determined by photon energy, and is characteristic of the source (F18 vs C11)
Scatter and random coincidences result in degradation of image quality

Sensitivity: PET/CT much higher than that of SPECT because PET uses multiple pairs of detectors

1) Helicase binds to origin and separates strands
2) Binding proteins keep strands apart
3) Primase makes a short stretch of RNA on the DNA template
4) DNA polymerase adds DNA nucleotides to the RNA primer
5) DNA polymerase proofreading activity checks and replaces incorrect bases
6) Continuous (leading) strand synthesis continues in a 5' to 3' direction
7) Discontinuous (lagging) synthesis produces Okazaki fragments on the 5' to 3' strand
8) Enzymes remove RNA prime. Ligase seals sugar-phosphate backbone

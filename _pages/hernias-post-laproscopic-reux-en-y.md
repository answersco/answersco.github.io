title: "Hernias post laproscopic reux-en-Y"
---
First lets explain the types of approaches:
1. Retrocolic: This is where the jejunum passes POSTERIOR to the transverse mesocolon
2. Antecolic: This is where the jejunum passes ANTERIOR to the transverse mesocolon


Locations for hernias:
1. Can be at the transverse mesocolon in the retrocolic approach
2. Can be at the gastrojejunostomy
3. Can be BEHIND the roux limb mesentary with either the antecolic or retrocolic approach. Left to right

Factors that increase the risk of internal hernia formation
1. Laproscopic has a higher risk of hernia (less adhesions so stuff remains mobile)
2. People with MORE weight loss have higher chance of internal hernia (less fat to smush things into a stationary space)

title: "Lung disease associated with chylous pleural effusion:"
---
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM): diffuse cystic lung disease caused by bronchiolar obstruction and lung destruction due to proliferation of immature smooth muscle cells in small vessels, lymphatics, and bronchioles
~1% of patients with tuberous sclerosis have lung disease that is nearly identical to LAM.
Almost all cases of sporadic LAM are in women of childbearing age, and some respond to antiestrogen therapy.
Associated with PTX and chylous pleural effusion
CT: numerous thin-walled lung cysts
In contrast to LCH, the cysts in LAM tend to be round and regular
Also, LAM affects all 5 lobes, while LCH is upper-lobe predominant.

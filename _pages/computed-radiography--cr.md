title: "Computed Radiography (CR)"

Use Storage Phosphors - this is a substance that can emit light when exposed to a radiation source 
CR systems can work with a conventional xray machine
The storage phosphor holds a latent xray image, it is then exposed to a red laser which liberates the trapped electrons converting the energy to blue-green light. The light is directed onto a photodetector which amplifies the light signal. 

Sampling Pitch: This is the distance between laser positions as it is reading the plate

Important facts:
1. Amount of light detected is proportional to the intensity of the incident x-ray
2. Photostimulated phosphor has wide detectable range 
3. The plate is reset by forceable exposure to bright white light. If you do not do this you get ghosting artifact

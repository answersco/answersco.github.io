title: "Equivalent dose (EqD)"
---
This is the absorbed dose MULTIPLIED by a RADIATION weighted factor 
Basically, this takes into consideration that different types of radiation are going to cause different levels of biological harm
alpha particle = radiation weighted factor = 20, gamma or xray radiation weighted factor = 1 
Effectively this standardizes does across different radiation sources

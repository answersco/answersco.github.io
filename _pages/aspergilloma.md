Saprophytic aspergillosis (aspergilloma):

If symptomatic, it most commonly presents with hemoptysis.
Aspergilloma is mobile&#8594; will change position when the patient is imaged in a different position.
Monod sign: when a crescent of air is seen outlining the mycetoma against the wall of the cavity (air crescent sign, on the other hand, is reserved for angioinvasive aspergillus).

title: "NSIP"
---
subpleural and basilar predominant without honeycombing and with ground glass opacities. +traction bronchiectasis. associated pattern with systemic scleroderma.

Non-specific interstitial pneumonia, the predominant CT feature includes ground glass opacities

Patients typically younger (40-50) than IPF patients, with similar symptoms (dry cough and dyspnea), but better 5-year survival, with patients typically responding to steroids.
May be idiopathic or associated with other diseases&#8594; NSIP is most common pulmonary manifestation in patients with collagen vascular disease. 
May also be caused by drug reaction, occupational exposure, or dermatomyositis
Key feature of NSIP (both forms) is presence of GGO, which is almost always bilateral, and can distinguish NSIP from IPF
Like UIP, NSIP tends to affect the posterior peripheral lower lobes. Primarily upper lobe disease should suggest other diagnoses (e.g. chronic HST pneumonitis or sarcoidosis.
Key finding (not sensitive, but very specific): sparing of immediate subpleural lung (not seen in UIP, and can be seen in both cellular and fibrotic NSIP).
Fibrotic NSIP: predominantly features GGO with fine reticulation and traction bronchiectasis.
Honeycombing is usually absent. Its presence should suggest UIP.
Worse prognosis compared to cellular NSIP, but better prognosis than UIP.
Cellular NSIP: also features GGO, but without significant fibrotic changes.
Much less common than fibrotic NSIP, with better prognosis.

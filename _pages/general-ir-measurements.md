0.039 inch = 1 mm
0.035 inch = normal guide wire size that you are going to use
0.018 or 0.014 = MICROwires
Glidewires = hydroPHILIC coating to pass stenosis, clot, etc
Wire length is given in CM - 180 cm wire (standard) 260 cm (long wire)
18 GAUGE needle will accept an 0.035 in wire 
21 GAUGE needle will accept an 0.018 in wire (this is your micropuncture setup) 
Minimum guidewire length, you are going to want your guidewire to be at least TWICE the length of your catheter so that you can make safe exchanges 

3 French = 1 mm
Diameter in mm = French/3
Standard 0.035 wire will fit through a 4 French catheter, or larger.

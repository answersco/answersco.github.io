title: "Scintillator crystal"
---
Note: INCREASED crystal thickness DECREASES spatial resolution
Note: Crystal thickeness is the major limiter of spatial resolution with PET/CT (the smaller the crystal the MORE detectors which = more spatial res)
Note: THICK crystals help absorb HIGH ENERGY photons

American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification
Class I: normal healthy patient
Class II: mild systemic disease
Class III: severe systemic disease
Class IV: severe systemic disease that is constant threat to life
Class V: moribund patient not expected so survive without the operation
Class VI: declared brain-dead patient whose organs are being removed for donor purposes

ASA I and II generally qualify for moderate sedation.
III and IV or with other significant risk factors may require additional consideration, including possible consultation with anesthesiology or performance of sedation by anesthesiologist/anesthetist.

When sedation is performed under the supervision of a radiologist, there must be a separate qualified healthcare professional whose primary focus is the monitoring, medicating, and care of the patient. The patient must have intravenous access. Continuous monitoring should include at minimum level of consciousness, respiratory rate, pulse-oximetry, blood pressure (as indicated), heart rate, and cardiac rhythm.

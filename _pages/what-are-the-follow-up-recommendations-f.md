title: "What are the follow-up recommendations for simple adnexal cysts in post menopausal women?"
---
Simple ovarian cysts 2-7 cm in size in postmenopausal women should initially be imaged with ultrasound annually to ensure stability with respect to size and appearance. Once stability is documented, or if cyst size decreases, the follow-up interval may be lengthened. These lesions are almost certainly benign. MR should be reserved to complex lesions that cannot be characterized as simple cysts on ultrasound.

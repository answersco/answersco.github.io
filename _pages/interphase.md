title: "Interphase"
---
-includes G phases and S phase
Cell prepares for division
-replicates DNA and subcellular structures
-composed of G1, S, and G2
 -cells may exit the cell cycle at G1 to enter G0 (a quiescent (waits) phase)

when DNA replication occurs

-mom and dad stick together and exchange pieces of themselves called crossing-over
-purpose is to increase genetic diversity

-period of growth
-preparing for next round of cell division
-includes G1, S, and G2

the period of the cell cycle between cell divisions in which the cell grows, replicates its DNA, and prepares for mitosis or meiosis; divided into G1, S, and G2 phases

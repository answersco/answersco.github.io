title: "Bremsstrahlung (radiative loss)"
---
this is how about 80% of xrays are produced. Electrons that come close to the nucleus and then give off energy. The AMOUNT of bremsstraglung interaction is proportional to the ENERGY of the incoming charged particle and the ATOMIC NUMBER of the asorber w/ the higher the Z, the more radiative loss. There does NOT appear to be the actual EJECTION of electrons in radiative loss.
Remember you do NOT get peaks from radiative loss, this is a SPECTRUM of energy

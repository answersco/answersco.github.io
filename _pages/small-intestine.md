title: "Small intestine"
---
-where the majority of digestion and absorption of nutrients; consists of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum
1) duodenal secretions that aid in digestion come from the pancreas, gallbladder, liver, and glands in the wall of intestine
2) pancreatic enzymes: have a high/alkaline pH called bicarbonate which helps to neutralize stomach acid
-these enzymes are trypsin, amylase, and lipase which digest proteins, starches, and fats respectively
3) majority of digestion happens in jejeum
4) B12 and bile salts are absorbed in ileum
5) segmental contractions help to mix and churn food for digestion
6) intestinal peristalsis propels food forward

-secretes enzymes aiding in protein and carb digestion
-parts are duodenum (attaches to stomach), jejunum &amp; ileum (attaches to long intestine)
-functions include:
1) receive liver and pancreas juices for digestion
2) food digestion and nutrient absorption in the bloodstream

-includes duodenum, jejunum, and ileum
-90% of absorption occurs here

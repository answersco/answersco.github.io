title: "CT radiation dose: variations within the scan plane, and z-axis variation"
---
Variations within Scan Plane:
Head CT: central and surface doses are very similar
Bondy CT: surface is about twice the central dose

Z-axis variation: &quot;tails&quot; of radiation along the edge of the area being scanned
The profile of radiation is not limited to the primary area being imaged
Add up on multiple scans

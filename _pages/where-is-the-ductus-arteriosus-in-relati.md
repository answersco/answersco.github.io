title: "Where is the ductus arteriosus in relation to the left subclavian artery?"

Just Distal to it!

In the normal heart with a left aortic arch, the arterial duct arises from the left pulmonary artery very close to the bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk and connects to the transition area between aortic arch and descending aorta just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery.

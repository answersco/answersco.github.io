title: "Normal waveforms in hepatic vasculature"
---
Portal vein: high-flow, low-pressure, low-resistance conduit 
-Gentle phasic waveform with respiratory variation
-Flow toward the liver (hepatopedal)
-Splenic and SMV have similar waveforms
-Flow in portal system increases dramatically after meals

Hepatic veins:
Variable waveform influenced by right atrial contractions

Hepatic artery: low-resistance arterial waveform.

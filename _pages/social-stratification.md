title: "Social stratification"
---
This phenomena creates a hierarchy or tiered system in which different groups of individuals have varying amounts of power within a society. Social stratification means that certain individuals (elites) have more power and influence than other individuals, such as commoners and slaves. In Neolithic times, social stratification emerged when food surpluses allowed some members of society to do things other than farm. This led to job specialization and the beginnings of a class system featuring elites, merchants, artisans, farmers and slaves.

title: "Exercise testing: patient selection, technique, and evaluation"
---
Patients with claudication and normal or near-normal pulse exams and physiologic tests should undergo exercise testing.
Occlusive lesions that are well-compensated at rest may be unmasked by hyperemia created in the distal muscular bed during exercise.
Testing performed before and after walking on treadmill at grade of 10-12 degrees for 5 minutes at 1.5-2 mph. Time to onset and features of symptoms recorded.

Normally, ABI remains unchanged or even increases with exercise, and the amplitude of the volume recording increases with preservation of the contour.
Abnormal response indicates hemodynamically significant occlusive disease.

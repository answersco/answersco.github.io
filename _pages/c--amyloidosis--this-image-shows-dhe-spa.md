title: "C. Amyloidosis. This image shows DHE sparing the subendocardium in a somewhat patchy distribution (arrows); this is most consistent with amyloidosis. There is no pericardial thickening to suggest constrictive pericarditis. Transmural and subendocardial infarctions would have DHE in a coronary artery distribution. VSD would demonstrate a connection between the ventricles."

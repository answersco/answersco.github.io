1) post operative checks:
-every 2 hours for 24 hours
-every 4 hours for 28-72 hours
-every 4-8 hours routinely or PRN
2) healthy stoma appearance:
-highly vascular
-beefy Red/Pink in appearance
-smooth surface
3) assess stoma for prolapse or retraction
4) assess for irritation
-there are no nerve endings so the stoma may be irritated without the client's awareness
5) skin irritations should be reported and documented
-dermatitis, rash, pimples, and bluish discoloration 
-ileostomy to have more irritation bc it is liquid stool

Spoiled GRE (T1)

Hemochromatosis: no 180 refocusing pulse so the effect of the iron is that T2* effects are pronounced and you lose signal with time

- Therefore, you want to obtain out of phase at 2.2 ms and in phase at 4.4 ms to look for the signal loss on IN PHASE (for hemochromatosis)
- at 6.6 seconds, liver will appear dark on out of phase (because of inherent loss of signal due to T2*) - you'll think it's Fatty liver when it's actually hemochromatosis!

title: "Dementia imaging: Alzheimer, Lewy body, Multi-infarct, and Pick disease."
---
Alzheimer: symmetrically decreased SPECT tracer in the posterior temporal and parietal lobes.
Lewy body: appears similar to Alzheimer but also involves the occipital calcarine cortex.
Multi-infarct: multiple asymmetric foci of decreased metabolism.
Pick: decreased uptake in the frontal lobes and the anterior temporal lobes.

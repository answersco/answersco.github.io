title: "Negative feedback"
---
1) releasing hormones in the hypothalamus (TRH, CRH, GnRH)
2) tropic hormones in adenohypophysis (TSH, ACTH, FSH, LH)
3) target glands (thyroid, adrenal cortex, gonads
4) hormones
5) target cells AND goes back to the hypothalamus to shut off hormone release bc we don't want an overload

**every hormone has its own circadian rhythms regulated by negative feedback and outer factors

title: "In CXR, the contrast between bone and soft tissue is primarily due to?"
---
Photoelectric effect is the primary interaction determining contrast between soft tissue and bone in diagnostic XR.
The absorption in bone is greater than that of surrounding soft tissue since the mass attenuation coefficient of photoelectric effect is proportional to Z cubed, where Z is the atomic # of absorbing medium. Because of its calcium content, Z of bone is ~ twice that of soft tissue.

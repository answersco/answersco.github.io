Cross-sectional studies: investigator makes all measurements at one point in time
Well-suited to describing variables and their distribution patterns
Since all measurements are from one point in time, this design yields prevalence (defined as proportion of a population who has a disease)
Major strength: relatively fast and inexpensive
Major weakness: difficulty in establishing causation (since prevalence depends on both disease incidence and disease duration)

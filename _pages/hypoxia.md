title: "Hypoxia"
---
-Decreased oxygen to tissue and cell

-Change in mental status; delusional

-Tachycardia or bradycardia

-Diaphoresis

-Hypertension, vessels constricting trying to maintain that balance

-Dusky (blueish-grey) color

**Can be life threatening --&gt; IF A PULSE OX IS LESS THAN 92%, NOTIFY NURSE IMMEDIATELY = HEART ATTACK WILL OCCUR

1) insufficient oxygen to meet metabolic demands of tissue and cells
-results from hypoxemia
2) causes: low Hb, decreased inspired O2, inability to exact O2, decreased diffusion of O2, poor tissue perfusion, &amp; impaired ventilation
3) signs: restlessness, apprehension, changes in LOC, behavioral changes, dizziness, &amp; cyanosis
-restlessness is usually first sign
-have low o2 for awhile once manifest these changes

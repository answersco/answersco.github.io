title: "Measurement made in tunneled HD catheter placement"
---
Important to get an accurate measurement from the entry site to the RA.
-After transitional dilator (e.g. Cope 6.3 Fr dilator set) is placed, advanced stainless steel wire to middle of RA, and bend the wire.
-Place a straight hemostat at entry site, and pull wire back until tip lines up with hemostat under fluoro. Clamp the wire here.

The appropriate length is determined and the next larger length of tunneled catheter is chosen (if 18 cm measured, a 19 cm tip-to-cuff tunneled catheter is suitable.

The cuff should be placed in the subcutaneous tract at least 3 cm from the incision site. Thus, 3 cm is added to the difference between the chosen tip-to-cuff catheter length and the measured length. Using our example, 3 cm would be added to the 19 cm catheter length minus the 18 cm measured length, resulting in a 4 cm tunneled tract length.

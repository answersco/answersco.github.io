title: "What is a teardrop fracture? what's the mechanism? what's the stability?"
---
-avulsion of the anterior inferior vertebral body. Extension tear drop is typically C2 and flexion tear drop is C3-C7

-mechanism: hyper flexion and compression (diving into shallow pool) or forced extension

-stability: unstable due to ligamentous injury (neurological injury permanent, force is severe that it pulls anterior body off)

MOST SEVERE FRACTURE OF THE CERVICAL SPINE (need to be immobilized initially)

title: "Perc chole: trochar technique"
---
Trochar technique is preferred by authors (Requisites).
-Particularly suited for patients who can't travel to IR department.
-US used to choose an access route that passes through the liver.
-22-g spinal needle inserted into GB as a reference needle. Bile aspiration confirms position.
-An 8-Fr pigtail catheter (Cook) is inserted into the GB in tandem to the reference needle. A quick thrust required rather than a gradual approach when inserting the catheter to prevent movement of the GB ahead of the catheter.
-Position can be confirmed by bile aspiration or US.
-Catheter tip coiled in GB. A locking pigtail catheter is necessary to prevent dislodgement.

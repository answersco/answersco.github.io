title: "How do exiting nerve roots exit with respect to nomenclature of Vertebral bodies?"
---
In cervical spine, the exiting nerve root for that numbered vertebral body exits ABOVE the named vertebral body.
(e.g. C3 nerve root exits ABOVE C3 (at C2-C3)

but there's a C8 exiting nerve root at C7-T1

Therefore, in thoracolumbar spine, the exiting nerve root exits BELOW the named vertebral body
(e.g. L4 nerve root exits BELOW L4 at L4-L5)

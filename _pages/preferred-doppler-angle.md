title: "Preferred Doppler Angle?"
---
The preferred Doppler angle is 30-60 degrees.
1) When &gt;60 degrees, the Doppler shift is small resulting in a low signal and minor errors in angle accuracy can magnify errors in velocity.
2) When &lt;20 degrees, refraction causes loss of signal and aliasing becomes an important problem.

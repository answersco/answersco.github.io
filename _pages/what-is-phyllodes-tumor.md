title: "What is phyllodes tumor?"
---
Phylloides = 10% malignant degeneration risk and can met to lungs &amp; bone; tends to RECUR after excision 

- fast growing breast mass in older women (no lympathic mets so don't FNA LN)

- large well CIRC lesion/solid with posterior acoustic enhancement; mimics fibroadenoma on US

Clefts between leaf-like projections form &quot;cystic&quot; spaces suggest dx of Phylloides over FA

- Treatment = Wide local excision (no chemo), but can recur

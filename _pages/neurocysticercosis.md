Neurocysticercosis&#8594; 4 stages
Viable/vesicular&#8594; several CSF-intensity cysts, without enhancement. These may demonstrate an eccentric dot (scolex).
Colloidal&#8594; least specific findings, presenting as ring-enhancing lesions.
In contrast to pyogenic abscess, these lesions feature increased diffusivity.
Nodular/granular&#8594; edema decreases as the cyst involutes and the cyst wall thickens.
Calcified&#8594; small parenchymal calcifications and foci of susceptibility.
20% with intraventricular neurocysticercosis, usually in the aqueduct of Sylvius or 4th ventricle.

Taenia solium
From eating undercooked pork

4 phases:
1. Vesicular - thin walled cysts (iso iso T1/T1 + no edema)
2. Colloidal - Hyperdense cysts (hyper hyper T1/T2 + edema)
3. Granular - Cyst shring, wall thickens + less edema
4. Nodular - Small calcified lesions with no edema

Taenia solium

1) Vesicular: non-enhancing cysts
2) Colloidal: ring-enhancing cysts, edema
3) Nodular: involuting cyst, thick walls, less edema
4) Granular: calcifications

Requires fastidious technique to prevent emboli in these patients with right-to-left shunt.
-IV lines should be free of bubbles and have particulate filters, heparinization of catheter is performed, and frequent catheter flushing needed.
-May require higher flow rates (30-35 mL/sec for 2 seconds) than in older patients with chronic PE.
-Need complete angio with multiple views, with attention for small AVMs that can be missed at CT

AVMs: identifiable by one or more large feeding arteries and a large draining vein that opacifies before the remainder of the pulmonary veins.
-The actual AV communication is often saccular or aneurysmal.

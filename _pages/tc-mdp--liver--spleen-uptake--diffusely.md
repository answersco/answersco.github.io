title: "Tc-MDP: liver, spleen uptake. Diffusely decreased bone uptake"
---
Liver uptake: 
-Think about too much aluminum contaminating the tracer
-Cancer (hepatoma or mets)
-Amyloidosis
-Liver necrosis

Spleen: commonly show auto-infarcted spleen in sickle cell patient.
-Also have scattered hot and cold areas from bone infarcts.

Diffusely decreased skeletal uptake:
-Free Tc
-Bisphosphonate therapy

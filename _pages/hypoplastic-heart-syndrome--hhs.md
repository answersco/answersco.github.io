title: "Hypoplastic Heart Syndrome (HHS)"
---
Hypoplastic left heart (HLH) &#8594; underdevelopment of any part of the left heart, including LA, MV, LV, aortic valve, or aorta.
Survival dependent on PDA with resultant right to left shunting to supply systemic circulation.
Neonatal CXR usually normal due to patent PDA and persistent high pulmonary arterial resistance.
As pulmonary resistance decreases, pulmonary blood flow increases.
As ductus closes, blood clearance from lungs is delayed and pulmonary edema may result.
Repair: 3-stage Norwood procedure.
Stage 1: includes aortic reconstruction using the main pulmonary artery (Damus-Kaye-Stansel procedure) and placement of a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (BTS) &#8594; connects R subclavian artery to RPA
Stage 2: BTS replaced by bidirectional Glenn shunt&#8594; connects SVC to RPA.
Stage 3: modified Fontan performed once the patient cannot supply adequate oxygenated blood to the systemic circulation. Tunneled conduit connects the IVC to the pulmonary artery.

title: "What are complications of esoph duplication cysts?"
---
&gt;1/3 of esoph dup cysts are lined with ectopic, acid-secreting, gastric mucosa, which can bleed and ulcerate. Hemoptysis and hematemesis follow perforation into the airway or esophagus by an ulcerated cyst. Peptic esophageal strictures can follow.

Esoph dup cysts may also be associated with vertebral segmentation anomalies, esophageal and more distal bowel atresias, and other types of bronchopulmonary foregut malformations.

title: "What are the agents used for parathyroid imaging and how is it performed?"
---
Tc-99m sestamibi (20-30mCi) Distributes by blood flow and localized within mitochondria. Usually washes out more quickly from the thyroid than the parathyroid. Will lodge in a parathyroid adenoma, but also within a thyroid adenoma. SPECT is often used to localize/confirm.
Tc-99m-tetrofosmin: must use dual isotope subtraction.
Tc-99m-pertechnetate: Used to identify thyroid tissue only and is digitally subtracted from the sestamibi/tetrafosmin images.

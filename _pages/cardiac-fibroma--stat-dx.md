title: "Cardiac fibroma (stat-dx)"
---
2nd most common peds benign cardiac mass
Solitary myocardial mass most evident as area of altered contraction on cine imaging
Most commonly arises in left ventricular free wall, interventricular septum, or right ventricular free wall
Most often solid, well-defined mass
Less commonly has infiltrative appearance
Calcifications seen in 15-20% on CT
Isointense ventricular wall mass that does not show contraction on cine MR imaging
Hypointense on T2WI in adults, particularly centrally
T2 hypointensity is very uncommon in any other cardiac tumor and strongly suggests fibroma when seen (unlike hemangioma, which is T2-hyperintense)
LGE MR shows intense hyperenhancement
MR perfusion imaging can help differentiate from aggressive lesions as fibromas do not show enhancement on 1st-pass perfusion imaging

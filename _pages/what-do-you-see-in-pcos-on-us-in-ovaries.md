title: "What do you see in PCOS on US in ovaries?"
---
Ovaries &gt; 10 cc volume, at least 12 follicles that are &lt; 10 mm each (only needs to be seen in one ovary for diagnosis!)

For dx, you need these imaging findings + oligo/anovulation and/or hyperandrogegism

PCOS = &quot;Stein Leventhal Syndrome&quot;

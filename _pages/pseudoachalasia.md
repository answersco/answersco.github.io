Achalasia: there is transient relaxation of the bird's beak stricture with standing.
Pseudoachalasia: fixed obstruction doesn't relax with standing.

Obstructing ge junction cancer. In normal achalasia there is relaxation of the stricture upon standing, in pseudo this doesn't happen- fixed obstruction doesn't relax with standing.

Pseudoachalasia (AKA secondary achalasia)
Identical appearance as achalasia, but due to cancer at GE junction
Main distinguisher: real Achalasia will eventually relax, while pseudoachalasia will not.

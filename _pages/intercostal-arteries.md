title: "Intercostal arteries"
---
Intercostal arteries arise from the posterolateral aspect of thoracic Ao from the level of T3-T12.
Arteries to 1st-3rd intercostal spaces: usually arise from a pair of common trunks on each side of the aorta = supreme intercostals

From T4-T12, each intercostal space has its own pair of arteries.
These have multiple anastomoses, including internal mammary arteries anteriorly and chest wall arteries laterally.
Less constant anastomoses to anterior spinal and bronchial arteries.

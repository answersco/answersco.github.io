title: "Hematoma, Epidural-Subdural"
---
Best diagnostic clue
Fusiform, extradural mass-like process with MR signal characteristics of hemorrhage
Location
May be located at any spinal level
Dorsal to thecal sac &gt; ventral
Extends more freely in dorsal epidural space 
Ventral spread limited by dural attachments to posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL), anulus
Size
Typically extends over multiple levels
Rarely focal
Morphology
Typically fusiform, oval, or tubular
May see &quot;capping&quot; of ends of hematoma by epidural fat in thoracic spine on sagittal imaging
Confirms epidural (rather than subdural) location

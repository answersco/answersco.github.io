Most common locations of involvement are the SA space over the cerebral hemispheres, basilar cisterns, brain parenchyma, and ventricles. 
-Basilar cisterns portends worst outcome.

Vesicular (thin-walled cyst): iso-iso T1/T2, no edema
Colloidal: hyperdense cyst (bright-bright T1/T2, edema)
Granular: cyst shrinks, wall thickens&#8594; less edema
Nodular: small calcified lesion&#8594; no edema

Vesicular (thin wall, iso/iso, no edema)
Colloidal (bright/bright, edema)
Granular (thicker wall, less edema)
Nodular (small calcified lesion, no edema)

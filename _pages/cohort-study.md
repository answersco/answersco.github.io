title: "Cohort Study"
---
-an example of an analytic study which focused on a group of people who share a common experience during a period of time
-the study selects a group participants who were initially free from a disease but were known to have been exposed a particular factor
-because of the study's ability to observe the development of new cases of disease, the study design allows for calculation of incidence rates and therefore estimates risk for disease
-attempts to find cause-and-effect relationships
EX. WTC in NYC observation over time about those who were know to be exposed to a particular factor

- AKA follow-up, longitudinal, prospective, incidence study
- look for disease as develops and observe over time with follow-up
- best for studying cause and effect
- can establish risk + protective factors

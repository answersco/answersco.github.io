title: "Carcinoid Tumor"

Best diagnostic clue
Solitary, enhancing distal ileal mass with mesenteric metastases
Location
GI tract (55%), bronchopulmonary (30%); genitourinary, and other (15%)
GI carcinoids: Small bowel (SB) (45%), rectum (20%), appendix (16%), colon (11%), stomach (7%)
Duodenal carcinoids are classified as neuroendocrine tumors along with those arising in pancreas

Carcinoid tumor: arises from neuroendocrine cells in bronchial walls
Common presentation is endobronchial mass distal to carina, which may cause obstructive atelectasis.
Up to 20% present as pulmonary nodule.
May be typical (low-grade) or more aggressive atypical variant, which carries worse prognosis.
Diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine hyperplasia (DIPNECH): extremely uncommon precursor to typical carcinoid tumor&#8594; characterized by multiple foci of neuroendocrine hyperplasia or tumorlets with bronchiolitis obliterans.

MIBG and Octreotide scan can be used to look for carcinoid

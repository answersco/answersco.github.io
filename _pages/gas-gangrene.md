title: "Gas gangrene"
---
-C. septicum, C. perfringens, others 
-infections of serious wounds, occasionally surgical sites
-wounds often deep, contaminated with debri - mechanisms of transport are endospores in the environment that people may contract from the environment
-dead tissue anaerobic conditions spores germinate in tissue which is their perfect environment to become metabolically active
-bacterium produce: several toxins and exoenzymes &amp;&amp; produce gas like CO2 and H
-spreads rapidly because subcutaneous and muscle tissue killed anaerobic conditions = increased bacterial growth = more tissue destroyed

title: "Bronchial artery embolization for hemoptysis: agents, complications"
---
Massive hemoptysis (defined as &gt; 300 ml/24 hrs)
90% involve the bronchial arteries, with the remainder typically from PAs
If patient continues to bleed after evaluation of bronchial and PA circulation, the subclavian, internal mammary, inferior phrenic, and celiac arteries should also be evaluated.
Bronchial arteries: arise from thoracic aorta at T5-T6, usually one or 2 arteries on each side.
Embolization: performed with distal embolic agent, usually particles.
Initial angiography should evaluate for rare presence of left-to-right shunt prior to embolization to prevent inadvertent cerebral embolization.
Coils are rarely used due to frequency of rebleeding.
Complication: nontarget embolization of the spinal cord via the anterior spinal artery or smaller tributaries arising from bronchial and intercostal arteries.

title: "High level control (air kerma limit)"

Remember it is normally 87 mGy/minute or 10 roentgen/min 

For VERY fat people you can use the HLC which allows you to crank to 20 roentgens/min which = 176 mGy/min

NOTE: if you use high level mode, you need audible or visual alarms in addition to the normal time alarm used for traditional fluoro

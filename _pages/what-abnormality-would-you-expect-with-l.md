title: "What abnormality would you expect with longstanding aortic regurgitation? A) Aortic dissection B) Left ventricular dilatation C) Left ventricular hypertrophy D) Right ventricular hypertrophy"

B. Left ventricular dilatation. Regurgitant lesions typically produce dilation due to volume overload. Stenotic lesions result in ventricular hypertrophy and if longstanding and severe can result in ventricular failure leading to ventricular dilatation.

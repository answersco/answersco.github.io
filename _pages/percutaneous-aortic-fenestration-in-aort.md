title: "Percutaneous aortic fenestration in aortic dissection: essential components"
---
Aortic fenestration is an option when perfusion of the true lumen is compromised by a distended false lumen, though performed less frequently since advent of stent-grafts
Essential components:
Identification of true and false lumens
Intravascular puncture through the dissection flap from one lumen to the other.
Balloon dilatation to enlarge the fenestration.

Final goal: normalization of pressures in both lumens, allowing reexpansion of the true lumen and improved perfusion of branch vessels

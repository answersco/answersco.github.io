title: "Silicosis and CWP"
---
Simple silicosis: multiple nodular opacities favoring upper lobes with egg-shell calcification of hilar nodes.
Perilymphatic nodules.

Progressive massive fibrosis (PMF): complicated type seen in silicosis and CWP (similar pattern also with talcosis)
-Formation of large masses in the upper lobes with radiating strands.
-Sometimes cavitate- raises suspicion of TB (which is more common in silicosis and CWP).
-T2 dark (unlike cancer, which is T2 bright).

CWP: multiple nodular opacities, with calcifications showing a central nodular dot.
-The small nodule pattern tends to have a perilymphatic distribution.
-Complicated form gives PMF.

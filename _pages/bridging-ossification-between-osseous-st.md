title: "Bridging ossification between osseous structures in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) typically occurs where initially?"
---
Answer: the sternocleidomastoid
Hereditary disorder leading to mature ossification within soft tissues, causing osseous bridging between osseous structures.
Initial site of osseous bridging is typically the SCM, followed by the shoulder girdle, upper arms, spine, and pelvis.
Pattern of ossification follows that of myositis ossificans in that initially there is a mass with edema distorting the fat planes, follwed by ossification over the ensuing weeks and months.

Autosomal dominant: age of onset ~ 5 years.

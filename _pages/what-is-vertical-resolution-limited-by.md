title: "What is vertical resolution limited by?"
---
Vertical resolution: limited by the # of raster lines that the display monitor uses

*you have to have alternating white/black to reproduce a line pair image on the II or FPD, so max # of lines in the vertical direction is half the # of actual lines used

BUT b/c the Bars in the line-pair pattern may not totally line up with the raster lines&#8594; the resolution usually less than predicted&#8594; correct with Kell factor (0.7)

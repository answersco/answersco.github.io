title: "Phase contrast MRA"
---
Uses bipolar gradients
High VENC for arterial imaging
Low VENC for venous imaging
Quantitative
Measures mean blood flow and direction
Compared to TOF:
- slower
- more sensitive to signal loss due to turbulence
- increased background suppression
- decreased sensitivity to intravoxel dephasing

The 140 keV gamma rays from 99mTc &#8594; cannot penetrate through the Pb shield
But the 740 keV emission of 99Mo &#8594; can penetrate the shield
If the dose calibrator registers the presence of activity from the shielded solution, 99Mo must be present.
By federal regulation&#8594; a maximum breakthrough of 0.15 microcuries of 99Mo per millicurie of 99mTc is allowed

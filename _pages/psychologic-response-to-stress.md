&quot;It is what it is&quot; -- coping with a stressful event

-ask pt's what their response is what usually happens during stress - What is your brain thinking? Do you have any behaviors? Do you do anything to help it?

1) Cognitive response: trying to logic it out; &quot;Well I'm not really going to fail this class bc I failed this exam, I still have seven more exams to go&quot;

2) Behavioral response: do you change your behaviors, are you still there being frustrated, being anxious, or eat more or do you go out and work out to try to relieve it - can be good or bad, detrimental or healthy

3) Emotion-focused: trying to step away and lessen emotional impact if you can

4) Problem-focused: look at this stressor and is there anything I can do to reduce this stressor

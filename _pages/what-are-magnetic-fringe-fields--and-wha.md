title: "What are magnetic fringe fields, and what type of MRI magnet design is used to combat them?"
---
Magnetic fringe fields&#8594; refer to magnetic field produced by the magnet but located outside the body, and can extend a large distance from the magnet's isocenter.

Actively shielded magnets&#8594; engineered to reduce the extent in space of magnetic fringe fields, and also limit effects of eddy currents.
These utilize 2 coils sets&#8594; carry currents in opposite directions.
Outer coil&#8594; drastically &#8595; fringe fields outside the magnet, while only slightly &#8595; the field inside the bore, produced by the inner coil.
The &#8595; field from inner coil is compensated for by &#8593; the current in the inner, main magnet coil
The combination of effects of the coils results in equivalent nominal field strength (e.g. 1.5 T) with drastically &#8595; fringe field.

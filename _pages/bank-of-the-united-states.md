title: "Bank of the United States"
---
Proposed by Alexander Hamilton as the basis of his economic plan. He proposed a powerful Private institution, in which the government was the major stockholder. This would be a way to collect and amass the various taxes collected. It would also provide a strong and stable national currency. Jefferson opposed the bank; he thought it was unconstitutional. Nevertheless, it was created. This issue brought about the issue of implied powers. It also helped start political parties.

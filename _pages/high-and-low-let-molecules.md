title: "High and low LET molecules"
---
LET = average amount of energy deposited per unit path length of the incident radiation- important for assessing the potential tissue and organ damage

High LET: neutrons, protons, alpha particles, and heavy ions. MUCH MORE DAMAGING (higher quality factor)
-More likely to cause direct damage (on DNA) and DS-DNA breaks.

Low LET: photons, gamma rays, electrons, positrons
-More common indirect damage and SS-DNA breaks

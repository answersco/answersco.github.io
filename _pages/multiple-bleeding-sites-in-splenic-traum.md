title: "Multiple bleeding sites in splenic trauma?"

Drop amplatzer plug into splenic artery PROXIMAL to the short gastric arteries (hopefully preserves collateral supply)

* The more proximal the aneurysm is within the artery, the less chance of infarction in spite of embolization of the splenic artery. This is due to the vast collateral supply to the spleen from short gastric and pancreatic arcade branches.

(Idea is to decrease splenic pressure while maintaining inflow, to prevent infarction and treat bleed!)

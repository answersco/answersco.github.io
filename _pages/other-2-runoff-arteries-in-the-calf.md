title: "Other 2 runoff arteries in the calf"
---
Tibioperoneal trunk: short artery of variable length that descends a few centimeters beyond the anterior tibial origin before bifurcating into posterior tibial and peroneal arteries.
-Posterior tibial: courses deep to the soleus muscle to the medial malleolous. Most medial artery in the calf.
-Peroneal artery: descends to the ankle posterior and medial to the fibula. Terminates at the ankle in a characteristic fork created by the anterior and posterior penetrating branches.

Posterior tibial and peroneal arteries are contained in the deep posterior fascial compartment of the calf.

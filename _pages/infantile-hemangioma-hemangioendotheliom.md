title: "Infantile hemangioma/hemangioendothelioma"
---
Vascular lesion (i.e. liver)
T2 hyperintense
T1 hypointense
Peripheral enhancement, central necrosis /delayed filling/central calcification and hemorrhage

Infantile hemangioma/hemangioendothelioma&#8594; high-flow vascular neoplasms
Most common vascular hepatic tumors, and may cause CHF in up to 25%
Tumor markers are not elevated
Infantile hemangioma is benign
Associated with Kasabach-Merrit syndrome: vascular neoplasm, hemolytic anemia, and consumptive coagulopathy.
May be focal, multifocal, or diffuse.
Lesions are highly vascular, T2-hyperintense, and tend to enhance peripherally with delayed fill-in. There may be calcification, central necrosis, and hemorrhage.
Angiography classically shows an enlarged celiac artery, with a decreased caliber of the aorta distal to the celiac axis.

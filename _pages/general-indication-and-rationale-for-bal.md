BRTO: alternative to TIPS for treatment of gastric varices as primary portosystemic collaterals.
-Large gastric varices often drain into systemic circulation through retroperitoneal collaterals to the left renal vein, usually in conjunction with the adrenal vein.
-Catheterization of these collaterals from the left renal vein with an occlusion balloon and temporary obstruction of outflow allows retrograde injection of a sufficient volume of sclerosing agent to fill the gastric varices.

2/3 develop other varices (usually esophageal) since underlying portal HTN isn't treated.
Encephalopathy rate is low
Liver function usually not impacted

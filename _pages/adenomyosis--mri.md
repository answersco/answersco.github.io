title: "Adenomyosis (MRI):"
---
Adenomyosis: represents ectopic endometrial glands within the myometrium
May present as pain and bleeding
Imaging: best seen on T2WI as a thickened junctional zone (&gt; 12 mm), often with multiple small foci of T2-hyperintensity
Borderline thickening of the junctional zone (8-12 mm) may be due to adenomyosis, but is not diagnostic.
Focal adenomyosis may mimic a leiomyoma, appearing as a localized low-signal mass on T1 and T2W images.
Adenomyosis typically features indistinct margins, while margins of leiomyoma are usually sharp.

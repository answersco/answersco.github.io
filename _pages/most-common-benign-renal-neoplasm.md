Renal AML: most common benign renal neoplasm
Most are sporadic; 40% associated with tuberous sclerosis (bilateral, with multiple renal cysts).
Risk of hemorrhage when large (&gt; 4 cm)
Early pathognomonic finding: macroscopic fat in non-calcified renal lesion.
The non-fat containing portion enhances avidly and homogeneously
Calcification is almost never present
MRI: fat component follows retroperitoneal fat on all sequences, and will saturate out on FS sequences.
Intracytoplasmic lipid is not a feature of AML&#8594; should be no significant signal dropout on dual-phase MRI.
4% of AMLs will not contain visible macroscopic fat&#8594; appear as hyperdense enhancing mass, requiring evaluation with MRI
T2-hyperintense mass: suggests RCC (clear-cell subtype)
T2-hypointense mass: nonspecific, representing either RCC (papillary) or AML with minimal fat&#8594; proceed to biopsy
US: appears hyperechoic, though up to &#8531; of RCC may also be hyperechoic&#8594; US thus unreliable to distinguish AML from RCC

title: "Stunned vs Hibernating vs Scarred Myocardium?"

All 3 of the following have abnormal wall motion.
1. Stunned Myocardium = after acute MI; it's just &quot;stunned&quot; so therefore it'll show normal PERFUSION with thallium or sestamibi
&quot; A stunned human's blood flow is still normal&quot;

2. Hybernating Myocardium = more chronic, 2/2 severe CAD causing chronic hypoperfusion = ABNORMAL fixed perfusion, but WILL redistribute delayed thallium &amp; take FDG
&quot;A hibernating bear's blood flow is decreased, but its Na/K &amp; Glucose Pumps are still working b/c it's still alive&quot;

3. Infarct/ Scar = dead = abnormal fixed perfsion, will NOT redestribute delayed thallium or take up FDG (chronic prior MI)

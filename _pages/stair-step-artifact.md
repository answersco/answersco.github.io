title: "Stair-Step Artifact"
---
Seen as a &quot;stair-step&quot; on the edges of MPR images, when you have a wide collimation of non-overlapping intervals.
Less severe with a helical scanner, where you are getting some overlap
Fixed by using thin slices

Reconstructions with slices that are too thick (non overlapping intervals)

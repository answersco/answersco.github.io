title: "NUMBERS: What energies to Rh and Mo filter out? Why can't you use &quot;Romo&quot;?"
---
Mo filters out 20 keV and above
Rh filters out 23 keV and above

(Characteristic XR: 
Mo = 18 and 19.5 keV
Ro = 20 and 23 keV)

Can't use RoMo because you'd be using a 20 keV filter to filter out your characteristic 23 keV Rh XRs!

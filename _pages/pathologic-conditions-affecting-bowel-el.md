-cancer/tumors, rectocele, may have an obstruction 
-Changes in stool characteristics or frequency may be one of the first clinical manifestations of a disease; their evaluation may lead to the diagnosis of the disease. For example, when a patient reports stool has become narrower or ribbon-like, a tumor may be obstructing normal stool passage through the colon. The nurse should report this finding to the physician. Similarly, a parent's report that a child's stools are frequent, bulky, greasy, and foul smelling suggests cystic fibrosis. This requires further evaluation, especially if other clinical manifestations are present.
-Diarrhea may result from pathologic conditions such as diverticulitis (inflammation of a diverticulum from obstruction [by fecal matter], resulting in abscess formation), infection, malabsorption syndromes (the inability of the digestive system to absorb one or more of the major vitamins, minerals, or nutrients), neoplastic diseases (tumors), diabetic neuropathy (damage to nerve cells), hyperthyroidism, and uremia (retention of urea in the blood).
-Constipation may be the result of conditions such as diseases within the colon or rectum and injury to, or degeneration of, the spinal cord and megacolon (extremely dilated colon).
-Outbreaks of food poisoning can result in severe gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea. 
-Intestinal obstruction occurs when blockage prevents the normal flow of intestinal contents through the intestinal tract
-Mechanical obstructions result from pressure on the intestinal walls. 
Examples of causes of mechanical obstruction include tumors, stenosis, adhesions, hernias, and strictures
-Functional obstructions result from an inability of the intestinal musculature to move the contents through the bowel. Examples of causes of functional obstruction include muscular dystrophy, diabetes mellitus, &amp; Parkinson disease

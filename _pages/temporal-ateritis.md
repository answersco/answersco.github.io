title: "Temporal ateritis"
---
This is normally in older men and is going to be a bit more peripheral than takayasu arteritis 
This involves the temporal artery (arising from the external carotid)
This is also going to involve the subclavian, axillary, brachial (not much passed brachial because these arteries become medium/small)

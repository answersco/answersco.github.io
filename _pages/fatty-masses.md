title: "Fatty masses:"

Fatty masses&#8594; all fat-density, circumscribed masses are benign (BI-RADS 2)
Lipoma&#8594; diagnosis can be made entirely by MM (US not required)
Radiolucent mass that may have a thin, discrete rim
No peripheral calcification (vs oil cyst)

Oil cyst&#8594; possible sequela of fat necrosis (dystrophic calcification is more common)
Circumscribed, lucent lesion that can peripherally calcify
US not ideal for further evaluation due to variable appearance

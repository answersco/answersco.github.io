title: "Which of the following is not an advantage of Cardiac MRI? A) MRI contrast has minimal nephrotoxicity B) Cardiac MRI does not require ionizing radiation C) Cardiac MRI is not operator dependant D) Cardiac MRI has shorter imaging time than CT E) The image is not degraded by adjacent bone or air"

D. Some of the major advantages of Cardiac MRI are that it has minimal nephrotoxicity, no ionizing radiation, its signal is not degraded in obese patients, and it is not operator dependant. However, the imaging time is significantly longer than in CT and requires a good amount of cooperation from the patient.

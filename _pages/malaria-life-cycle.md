title: "Malaria life cycle"
---
-caused by protozoa
1) malaria gets into red blood cells as the disease progresses
2) now, mosquitos, a vector that feeds off blood, bites the humans and the parasite now uses the mosquitos to replicate
3) inside the intestinal tract, the protozoa go through sexual reproduction
4) through the various stages of going through the mosquitos body, it then migrates to its salivary glands and whenever it bites a new person, it injects the protozoa and the cycle begins again
5) malaria is not transmitted through direct contact bc it has to go through the mosquito, reproduce in the mosquito, and bite a person for malaria to be transmitted

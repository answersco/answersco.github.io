Demyelinating disease caused by a papova virus. Occurs only in immunosuppressed patients, especially in AIDS.

Infection of immunosuppressed patients (AIDS, transplants, leukemics) caused by reactivation of JC virus. Progressive course to death within months. In non-AIDS patients, has a predilection for occipital lobes. In AIDS patients, any part of brain may be involved. High T2 and low T1 lesions within subcortical and deep white matter. Mass effect and contrast enhancement are almost always absent.

Demyelinating disease of immunocompromised patients caused by reactivation of JC virus.
MRI: asymmetric, multifocal white matter lesions that may become confluent.
Rarely mass effect or enhancement.
Usually involves the arcuate (subcortical U) fibers.
Usually no atrophy.

title: "PET physics (photon pairing FALSE COINCIDENCE)"

Scatter coincidence: one of hte photons has a compotion interaction and is deflected but still htis the detector within the right time window 

Note: The compton even lowers the photons energy level therefore this can be reduced by using a more narrow photopeak window

Random coincidence: just so happens that from two seperate events photons hit the right spots where it will look like a true even

Note: This is less likely with lower doses of radiotracer and can also be lowered with a more narrow timing window

title: "Effect of changing receiver bandwidth on SNR and spatial resolution"
---
Increased (broad) bandwidth: rapid sampling of data
-Fat bandwidth picks up more noise
-Broad bandwidth = decreased SNR, but faster imaging time and decreased mismatch artifacts like chemical shift and magnetic susceptibility.

-Narrow bandwidth = increased SNR

No effect on spatial resolution

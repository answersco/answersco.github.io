title: "The story of &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;"
---
You turn a year older and friends sing a certain song to you. The story of &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; goes back to the 1890s. In 1893 a teacher named Patty Smith Hill and her sister Mildred published a book called Song Stories for Kindergarten. The first song in the book was a four-line verse called &quot;Good Morning to All.&quot; Patty soon wrote new words to this jingle and it became the popular &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; song still sung today.

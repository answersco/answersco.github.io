title: "What measures the strength of radiation exposure in air from gamma ray radiation?"

Roentgen
1 roentgen is the amount of x-ray or gamma radiation that will deposit enough energy to liberate 1 electrostatic unit in 1 cubic centimeter of dry air.

SI unit for absorbed dose (on the other hand) is the gray, but the rad (radiation absorbed dose) is commonly used.

Si unit for dose equivalent is the sievert, but the rem is also commonly used (roentgen equivalent in man).

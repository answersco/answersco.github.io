&quot;Death with Dignity laws allow qualified terminally-ill adults to voluntarily request and receive a prescription medication to hasten their death. As of February 20, 2017, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington have Death with Dignity statutes.&quot; 


&quot;The American Nurses Association (ANA) prohibits nurses' participation in assisted suicide and euthanasia because these acts are in direct violation of Code of Ethics for Nurses with Interpretive Statements (ANA, 2001), the ethical traditions and goals of the profession, and its covenant with society. Nurses have an obligation to provide humane, comprehensive, and compassionate care that respects the rights of patients but upholds the standards of the profession in the presence of chronic, debilitating illness and at end-of-life.&quot;

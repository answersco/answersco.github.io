title: "Staging of prostate cancer:"
---
Prostate cancer staging: the most important goal of MRI is to distinguish between surgical and nonsurgical disease
Cancer that is contained within the gland (stage T2) is generally amenable to radical prostatectomy
Cancer that has spread outside of the gland (&gt; T3) is typically treated nonsurgically (e.g. anti-androgen and XRT)

T-staging:
T1: apparent by biopsy only
T2: confined within the prostate
T2A: &lt;50% of 1 lobe
T2B: &gt; 50% of 1 lobe
T2C: tumor involves both lobes
T3: tumor extends through the prostate capsule, and may involve seminal vesicles
T4: tumor invades adjacent structures other than seminal vesicles.

N-staging: 
N1: any regional LN metastasis
Extrapelvic nodes are M1A

M-staging:
M0: no metastases
M1A: nonregional LNs
M1B: bone metastasis
M1C: other metastasis

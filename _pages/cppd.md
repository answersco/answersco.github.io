title: "CPPD"
---
Chondrocalcinosis of the triradiate cartilage
Hooked osteophytes located at the MCP
If you see isolated arthritis in an odd joint such as the patellofemoral, radiocarpal, of talonavicular think CPPD
There can also be VERY BIG subchondral cysts

CPPD: &quot;degenerative change in an uncommon joint&quot; &#8594; shoulder, elbow, patellofemoral, radiocarpal, talonavicular (most common in knee)
Likes TFCC of wrist, peri-odontoid tissue, and intervertebral discs
Isolated disease in patellofemoral, radiocarpal, or talonavicular joint&#8594; think CPPD
Hooked MCP osteophytes with chondrocalcinosis is a classic look (hemochromatosis can look identical).

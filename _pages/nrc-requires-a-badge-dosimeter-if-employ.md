title: "NRC requires a badge dosimeter if employee is expected to get what % of the annual limit?"
---
10% of annual limit

(e.g. getting at least 5 mSv of the 50 mSv annual limit!)

* remember, if an employee is &lt; 18 yo, then their annual dose limit is 10% of an adult's (e.g. 5 mSv total annual dose limit!)

title: "RB-ILD versus desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP)"
---
Both are smoking-related lung diseases

RB-ILD: apical centrilobular GG nodules
DIP: more diffuse GGO, with patchy or subpleural distribution.

RB-ILD = respiratory bronchiolitis + symptoms
Tends to be more upper-lobe predominant (DIP more lower lobe)
Localized centrilobular GG nodules
Tends to involve entire cross-section of lung

DIP: thought of as end-spectrum of RB-ILD
Peripheral lower lobe predominant GGO, with small cystic spaces.

title: "Photomultiplier tube electron multiplication"
---
For every 5 scintillation photons impacting the photocathode, one electron is emitted.
For each accelerated electron that impacts the dynode &#8594; approximately 5 electrons will be emitted.
Total &quot;electron multiplication&quot; or gain achieved by the PMT is equal to 5N, where N = the # of dynodes

title: "Half-value layer"
---
Half-Value Layer (HVL) = thickness of material (classically designated in mm of aluminum) required to reduce the intensity of an x-ray beam to half its initial intensity.
As photon energy increases, HVL also increases
HVL related to linear attenuation coefficient for monoenergetic beams as HVL = 0.693 / &#956; (&#956; = linear attenuation coefficient).
For a polyenergetic beam (e.g. that produced by x-ray beam) &#8594; &#956; (LAC) has a strong energy dependence&#8594; HVL varies depending on the energy spectrum of the incident x-rays.

Standard half value layer of human skin is said to be 3 cm

The layer of material that can reduce radiation levels to half their level
The higher the average photon energy, the larger the HVL will be
Withe each HVL the average photon energy goes up 
HVL of an xray does NOT depend on the mAs, remember HVL is a QUALITY measurement
HVL does depend on beam filtration
HVL DOES depend on anode material
HVL DOES depend on kVp

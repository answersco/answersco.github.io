title: "IMPORTANT: Linear attenuation vs mass attenuation of water. Which one is different between liquid, ice, gas, and which is the same?"
---
MASS = SAME

Linear is different = describes the fraction of photons underoing an interaction per unit thickness of the material 
- it is DIFFERENT in ice, water, and water vapor (due to different lengths for the same amount of molecules)

title: "Refraction artifact"
---
Refraction is due to speed differences in tissues &#8594; causes the shadows seen at the edges of a fluid-filled structure (classically gallbladder) as sound passes from tissue to fluid
Causes a change in direction of the beam

Appearance:
Object can appear wider than it actually is
Object can appear misplaced to the side of the returning echo
Object can appear duplicated

Example: classically shown with duplicated SMA when imaging deep to rectus muscles and midline fat 
Will appear as a normal single vessel if you move the transducer to the side

When the ultrasound beam passes through tissues of different impedence, some of the beam will be &quot;bent&quot;.
The bent portion of the beam can hit a structure of interest and then the ultrasound machine will assume the structure is right underneath the probe

When do you see this?

Typically see this when looking through the rectus abdominus musculature and midline fat at the SMA 

How to fix:

Move probe making the incident pulse perpendicular to the interface

Happens related to interfaces.

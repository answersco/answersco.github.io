title: "Gradenigo syndrome"
---
It is defined by involvement of the abducens nerve (sixth cranial nerve) causing lateral gaze palsy.

Other symptoms of the syndrome include:
retroorbital pain due to pain in the area supplied by the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve (fifth cranial nerve),
Bell's palsy caused by involvement of the facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve), and
otitis media.

Other symptoms can include photophobia, excessive lacrimation, fever, and reduced corneal sensitivity.

The syndrome is usually caused by the spread of an infection into the petrous apex of the temporal bone.

Grandenigo syndrome: apical petrositis + Dorello's canal (CN6)
Otomastoiditis, facial pain (trigeminal neuropathy), and lateral rectus palsy

Complication of petrous apexitis
Otomastoiditis
Face pain (trigeminal neuralgia)
Lateral rectus palsy (Dorello's canal involved, CN 6)

Otomastoiditis, face pain, lateral rectus palsy. This is apical petrositis that hits Dorello's canal (CN6)

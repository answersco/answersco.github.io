title: "Physiologic possibilities for false lumen and involvement of branch vessels in dissection"
---
False lumen tends to remain at near systolic pressure throughout cardiac cycle, owing to poor outflow. This results in progressive enlargement of false lumen and compression of true lumen.

Fenestrations:
As the intima is peeled away from the media, small tears (&quot;fenestrations&quot;) occur at the origins of the branch vessels. In these instances, the blood supply to the branch vessel may be entirely form the false lumen.

Static obstruction:
Alternatively, the dissection may extend into branch vessel, causing compromised flow or leading to thrombosis (static obstruction).

Dynamic obstruction:
When a critical branch vessel is supplied from a compressed true lumen, organ ischemia can result (dynamic obstruction).

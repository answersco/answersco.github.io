title: "Thoracic aortography: injection rates and filming"
---
Injection rates for contrast vary from 20-35 ml/sec for 2 seconds, so a reasonably-sized pigtail catheter (5-7 French) is necessary
Up to 40-45 mL/sec for 2 seconds may be required for young trauma patients with high cardiac output.

Breath-holding is necessary.
DSA with rapid filming (minimum 4-6 frames/sec) is desired
For patients with slow flow or suspected dissection, extended filming for up to 30 seconds may be necessary.
For patients with large aneurysms and sluggish flow, slower filming with elongated contrast injection (increased total volume over longer period of time) improves opacification.

CO2 gas is contraindicated as contrast agent in chest.

IVC filter placement: initial IVC cavogram performed with high-flow (pigtail) catheter
Duplicated IVC: initial cavography may show absence of iliac vein reflux contralateral to the side injected.
Single filter must be placed above the IVC confluence, or filter placed in each duplicated IVC.
IVC diameter &gt; 28 mm: generally requires a bird's nest filter &#8594; can be placed in IVCs ranging from 28-40 mm
If IVC is &gt; 40 mm in diameter, separate IVC filters can be inserted into each common iliac vein
Preferred IVC filter location is immediately inferior to the lowest renal vein, including any variant renal veins (e.g. retroaortic LRV, which usually joins the IVC more inferiorly than the RRV).
Interruption of the IVC with azygos continuation: rare anomaly where blood from the lower IVC flows into the azygos and hemiazygos veins, into the thorax, and then into the RA.
Associated with congenital heart disease and polysplenia.
The presence of preexisting IVC thrombus may interfere with positioning of the IVC filter, requiring higher than normal placement.

Transposition of IVC: aberrant location to the left of aorta and spine. Both common iliac veins drain into single left-sided IVC, which ascends to left of aorta to join the left renal vein. The RRV crosses to the right and joins the IVC below its junction with the left renal vein.

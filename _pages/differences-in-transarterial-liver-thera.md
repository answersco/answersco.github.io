title: "Differences in transarterial liver therapy for metastatic CRC compared to HCC"
---
TACE, DEBs, and Y-90 considered when patients fail conventional systemic therapy.
-Similar indications, contraindications, technical details as for hepatoma, though extrahepatic disease is not a contraindication when the liver tumor burden dominates the clinical outcome.
-With all of these therapies, the embolic endpoint of sluggish flow or stasis is arrived at sooner than in treatment for hepatoma.

TACE: 3-drug regimen preferred (cisplatinum, mitomycin C, doxorubicin).
-Frequently less oil uptake in colon mets than in HCC.

DEBs: usually loaded with 25 mg of irinotecan.

Y-90: same as for hepatoma, including pretreatment angiography.

PWS: related to but rarer than KTS
-Cutaneous lesion is a capillary AVM- warm to the touch (unlike typical capillary cutaneous malformations) and may have a palpable or audible thrill.
-Limb hypertrophy: involves muscle and bone, but can be less prominent than in KTS, and anomalous lateral varicose veins and lymphatic malformations are infrequent.
-77% have isolated LE involvement.

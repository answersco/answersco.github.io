title: "ASD types, general info, and CXR findings"
---
Secundum:
- most common (50-70%)
- may close without treatment

Primum:
- largest (from endocardial cushion defect) 
- more likely to be symptomatic
- not amenable to device closure due to proximity to AV valve tissue.

CXR findings:
- Small ASD: normal CXR
- Large ASD is nonspecific, with cardiomegaly, increased vasculature, and small aortic knob (same as large VSD).

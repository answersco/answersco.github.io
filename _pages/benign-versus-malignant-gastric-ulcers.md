title: "Benign versus malignant gastric ulcers:"
---
Benign gastric ulcer: usually along lesser curvature (though ulcers related to ASA can occur in dependent greater curvature and antrum)
Radiation gastric folds are smooth and symmetric
Ulcer extends beyond the normal contour of the gastric lumen
Hampton line: represents nonulcerated acid-resistant mucosa surrounding the ulcer crater

Gastric carcinoma: may present with malignant ulceration
Asymmetric ulcer crater, with surrounding nodular tissue
Abrupt transition between normal gastric wall and surrounding tissue
Ulcer crater does NOT project beyond the expected location of the gastric wall
Carman meniscus sign: splaying open of a large, flat, malignant ulcer when compression is applied.

title: "Velamentous vs marginal cord insertion"
---
Velamentous: cord inserts into fetal membranes outside of the placental margin, then has to travel back through the membranes to the placenta.
More common in twins
Increased risk of IUGR and growth discordance between twins

Marginal insertion: almost velamentous
Cord inserts within 2 cm of placental margin
Also more common in twins

title: "What is the appropriate management of small or deep cyst like masses?"
---
Small cysts (&lt; 5 mm) or deep cysts (&gt; 3 cm deep to the skin) may not show posterior enhancement due to ultrasound attenuation. If the mass cannot be confidently characterized as a cyst (i.e., it is not anechoic, and there are no surrounding similar simple cysts), an aspiration attempt may be needed to confirm. If the aspiration does not confirm simple fluid, then the procedure should be converted to a biopsy.

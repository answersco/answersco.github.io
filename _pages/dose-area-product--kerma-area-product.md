Dose-area product (Kerma area product): 
Measures the radiation dose to air in mGy multiplied by the collimator area&#8594; mGy/cm
Measurement is independent of beam location
As beam moved away the intensity &#8595;, but it spreads out more.
Low dose to large skin area = high dose to small skin area
Magnification will &#8593; air kerma, but not KAP
Gives an estimate of total energy deposited in the patient, effective dose, and cancer risk. 
If something &#8595; the DAP/KAP, it probably also &#8595; the scatter and patient dose

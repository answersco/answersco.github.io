Bronchial anomaly (e.g. atresia) leads to ball-valve progressive air trapping, usually in the LUL 
&quot;I LUvL CLE&quot;
- Hyperinflated lung with ATTENUATED vessels
(Initial XRs will have opacification, which then clears the fluid and now becomes more lucent)

- Remember, sequestration is usually LLL

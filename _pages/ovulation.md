title: "Ovulation"
---
1) FSH stimulates the ovarian follicle = egg grows and the production of estrogen will begin
2) increased estrogen stops the pituitary from producing FSH and start to make LH 
3) an increase in LH = egg released from the ovary to ovulation

-LH surge cause primary oocyte to finish meiosis 1 and becomes a secondary oocyte
-this follows the rupture of Graafian follicle

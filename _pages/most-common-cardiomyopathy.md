Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM): autosomal dominant, with hypertrophic LV myocardium. Most common cardiomyopathy.
Asymmetric septal hypertrophy variant: idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS) &#8594; may cause LV outflow tract obstruction.
Diagnostic criteria: wall thickness of &gt; 15 mm and ratio of &gt; 1.5 compared to the lateral wall.
Wall thickness &gt; 30 mm is an indication for ICD placement.
Systolic anterior motion of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve can cause mitral regurgitation and resultant LA enlargement.
MRI used to confirm the diagnosis, measure LV mass, and quantify the degree of subvalvular stenosis. 
See concentric hypertrophy of the LV myocardium without chamber enlargement.

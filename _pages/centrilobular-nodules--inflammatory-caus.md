title: "Centrilobular nodules: inflammatory causes"
---
Inflammatory causes: most commonly HSP and RB-ILD
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: subacute phase primarily characterized by centrilobular nodules
Hot-tub lung: HST reaction to inhaled atypical mycobacteria, with similar imaging features as HSP
Respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD): inflammatory reaction to inhaled cigarette smoke mediated by pigmented macrophages
Diffuse panbronchiolitis: results in bronchiectasis, typically affecting patients of Asian descent
Silicosis: upper-lobe predominant centrilobular and perilymphatic nodules

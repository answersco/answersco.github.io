title: "History of surgery"

-history of mastectomy should not have BP taken on their surgical side, IVs, and blood draws to reduce risk of injury and inflammation to the arm bc when a pt has lymph nodes removed
-lymph nodes help drain fluid out of arm and when removed they have fewer pathways which can lead to lymphedema 
-body's response to injury site is to send fluid and infection fighting cells to the area which results in more fluid to an arm with less drainage sites which causes swelling

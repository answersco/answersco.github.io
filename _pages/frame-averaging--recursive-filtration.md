Frame-Averaging (Recursive Filtration): 
an image-processing feature that adds several images together with different weighting factors

Pros: &#8595; quantum mottle and &#8593; signal &#8594; SNR improves

Cons: &#8593; susceptibility to motion artifact and ghosting

Image process technique that adds several images together
Purpose: REDUCES quantum mottle and INCREASES S/N
Down side: INCREASES motion artifact and ghosting

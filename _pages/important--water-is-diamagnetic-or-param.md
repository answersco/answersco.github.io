title: "IMPORTANT: Water is diamagnetic or paramagnetic? Does this mean it is weakly attracted or repulsed when placed into a magnetic field?"
---
Diamagnetic (no unpaired electrons)

Therefore, it's weakly repulsed (internal field opposes the external field)

Example of something weakly attracted vs strongly attracted: Gd and DeoxyHb are weakly attracted and Iron/Cobalt (ferromagnetic substances) are strongly attracted to the external field and augment it

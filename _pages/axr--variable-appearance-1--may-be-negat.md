title: "AXR: variable appearance 1) may be negative (MC cause of bile emesis &amp; normal XR) 2) &quot;double bubble&quot;: otherwise gasless if complete, distal gas if incomplete 3) mimic distal SBO or ileus UGI: 1) key is location of the DJ junction- Ligament of Trietz - normally to left of left pedicles &amp; at same level as duodenal bulb 2) in malrotation, the junction is right of the left pedicles &amp; is lower than the bulb 3) duodenal obstruction 4) &quot;corkscrew duodenum&quot; 5) On CE, cecum will end above iliac crest &amp; be directed medially w/ IC valve pointing R dilated proximal bowel CT/US: 1) reversal positions SMA and SMV - normally RAVe w/ vein to the left in malrotation 2) US: clockwise &quot;whirlpool&quot; of SMV around SMA 3) CT: bowel loops twisting around mesenteric vessels Sx: 1) bilious emesis, pain, bloody diarrhea 2) if acute abdomen, don't do anything beyond AXR, go to OR.  Cz: torsion of bowel around SMA, SMV normally right and anterior to SMA: RAVe  Comp: can obstruct, necrose Tx: 1) duodenal obstruction &amp; bilious emesis, must assume malrotation/volvulus until proved otherwise 2) surg emergency (causes ischemic necrosis)  Ass: CDH, omphalocele / gastoschesis, prune belly, heterotaxy Info: malposition of intestines itself doesn't cause problems, but is associated with malfixation &gt; twist around narrow mesentary base LADD BANDS: 1) fibrous stalk of peritoneal tissue that attaches cecum to abdominal wall, causes duodenal obstruction 2) occurs with malrotion"

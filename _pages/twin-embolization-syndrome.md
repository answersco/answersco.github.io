title: "Twin embolization syndrome"
---
In monochorionic twins - when one dies risk for surviving twin is very poor bc multiple infarcts. In dichorionic twin surviving generally does good

When one monochorionic twin dies in utero the surviving twin is at risk for twin embolization syndrome, which can cause CNS, GI, or renal infarcts.

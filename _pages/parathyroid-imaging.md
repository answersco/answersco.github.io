title: "Parathyroid imaging?"

Tc-99m sestamibi. Taken up by thyroid and parathyroid, but thyroid uptake decreases over time.

- Use tech99m sestamibi 20mci; image at 15min, then 2h (be sure to get an image with the pinhole collimator)
- The sestamibi accumulates in thyroid and parathyroid but washes out from the thyroid on the delayed images

Dual PHASE: early and delayed - idea is that Tc-sestamibi goes to both thyroid and parathyroid but REALLY loves things with high BF and mitochondria which is typically the case with parathyroid adenoma. The radiotracer will have intense uptake on early phase and will persist

Dual ISOTOPE: use something that goes to both thyroid and parathyroid (options are Tc-sestamibi or 201 thallium chloride) You then SUBTRACT this from something that goes ONLY to the thyroid (I-123 or pertechnitate). Remember you dont really use 1-131 because you get shit image quality.

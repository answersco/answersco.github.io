title: "Gamma camera QC"
---
Can use a sheet source (cobalt-57) or a flood source (liquid Tc-99); Tc-99 must be prepared every day and because it is liquid, you can have inadequate mixing

Daily
- Uniformity - flood field 
o iintrinsic = s collimator 
&#167; Point source at the center of the crystal far away from face of crystal
o extrinsic = c collimator
&#167; Uniform disk on the surface of the crystal 
*** A variety of abnormalities can be seen on the uniformity images, including cracks in the crystal, collimator defects, and photomultiplier defects
Weekly
- Spatial resolution and linearity - Is tested by using a bar phantom (usually a four quadrant bar phantom) placed between the camera and a radioactive flood or sheet source
Quarterly
- High count flood
SPECT
- Monthly - center of rotation

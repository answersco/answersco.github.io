Direct FPD: converts x-ray directly to charge using amorphous selenium
X-rays absorbed by selenium&#8594; electrons released&#8594; electron-hole pairs travel to surface of selenium and neutralize a portion of the applied &quot;bias&quot; charge, done in proportion to x-ray intensity.
No lateral dispersion.
Electrical charges are drawn in along the electric field lines to the charge storage capacitor electrodes connected to the TFT
The pattern of charges is scanned and converted to a digital signal stored by each TFT.

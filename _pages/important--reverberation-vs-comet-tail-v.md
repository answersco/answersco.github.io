title: "IMPORTANT: Reverberation vs comet tail vs ring down artifacts?"

All violate assumption that echo returns after just one reflection.

Reverb = 2 highly reflective surfaces (game of pong) = multiple equidistantly spaced linear reflections

Comet Tail = same as reverb but the space between the parallel surfaces are &lt; 1/2 the SPL. therefore it looks like a triangle because later echoes get attenuated and have decreased amplitude

Ring Down = sound wave encounters fluid trapped between a tetrahedron of air bubbles (vibrations create a nearly continuous sound wave sent back to probe) = parallel band extends posterior to gas collection

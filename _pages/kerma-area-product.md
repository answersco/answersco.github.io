KAP
This is the KERMA X the cross sectional area of the beam
Better estimate of potential dose
Think of this as the TOTAL radiation used in the exam 

KAP IS INDEPENDENT OF SOURCE DISTANCE
This is because although as you move AWAY from the source, yes you will decrease the photon energy by the inverse square law; however, the beam AREA IS GOING TO GET BIGGER by a squared factor as well.

KAP does NOT indicate the risk of skin burns

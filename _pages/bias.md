title: "Bias"
---
Bias: occurs when the groups of patients being studied differ in ways (other than the ones being studied) which affect outcome&#8594; most fall into 3 broad categories
Selection bias: occurs when comparisons are made between groups of subjects that differ in ways (other than the factors under study) that affect outcomes.
Spectrum bias: occurs when the sample is missing important subgroups
Verification bias: occurs when patients with positive or negative test results are preferentially referred for the reference standard test&#8594; then sensitivity and specificity are based only on those patients who underwent the reference test.
Sampling bias: occurs if some members of a population are more or less likely to be included than others.
All types of selection bias may reduce the ability to generalize results to the test of the population (i.e. external validity is compromised)
Measurement bias: occurs when methods of measurement are dissimilar between groups of patients.
Review bias: occurs when tests are performed or interpreted without proper blinding.
Confounding bias: occurs when 2 factors are associated and the effect of one is distorted or confused by the effect of the other.

the influence of attitudes, personal beliefs, and experiences on memory

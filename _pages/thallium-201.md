title: "Thallium 201"
---
cyclotron produced
73 hr half life (long so admin less)
decay by electron capture
emits 69-81 keV xrays (low- more attenutation artifact)
K analog in Na/K active transport
50%+ stenosis shows defect perfusion
resdistribution- will normalize in ischemic but viable tissue

cyclotron produced
electron capture- low energy xrays (69-81 keV)
73 hr hlf life
Distribution: ki, heart, liver, thyrd, bowel 
rarely still used dt half life and radiation dose

73 hours; 69-81 KeV

Cyclotron-produced
Decays by electron capture&#8594; produces relatively low-energy characteristic x-rays of 69-81 keV
T1/2 = 73 hours
Normal distribution: prominent uptake in kidneys, heart, liver, thyroid, and bowel
Infrequently used due to its long half-life and resultant high radiation exposure
Historically, thallium has been used in combination with gallium scan to distinguish between Kaposi sarcoma, lymphoma, and TB in immunocompromised patients
Also historically used as a myocardial agent

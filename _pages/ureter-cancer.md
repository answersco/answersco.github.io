title: "Ureter Cancer"

Ureter Cancer: (transitional cell)
Location: think about where you get the most stasis
- Renal Pelvis: twice as common as ureter
- Distal third of the ureter: Most Common Site
- Middle is 2nd most common
- Proximal is 3rd most common

Relationship to Bladder Cancer:
- Bladder cancer is way more common (100x more)
- if you have bladder cancer, you don't get upper tract cancer
- since upper tract cancer is not common, if you smoked enough to get a renal pelvis cancer, you probably have multifocal disease with cancer in the bladder

- Bladder cancer can be isolated
- Ureteral cancer usually has bladder cancer

title: "Appearance of hematogenous mets and lymphangitic carcinomatosis (LC)"
---
Hematogenous mets: most commonly involves pulmonary nodules (multiple, random distribution, favoring lower lobes due to higher blood volume).
Nodules tend to be smoother than primary cancer.
Usually breast, kidney, thyroid, colon, head/neck SCC (cavitate).
Cannonball mets: RCC or choriocarcinoma (testicle).
Feeding vessel sign: prominent vessel heading into nodule- mets or septic emboli

LC: usually bronchogenic carcinoma invading lymphatics, or breast, stomach, pancreas, and prostate.
Nodular thickening of interlobular septa and subpleural interstitium- unlike IPF, this does NOT classically distort the pulmonary lobule.

Direct invasion: usu from mediastinum, pleura or chest wall.
esophageal, lymphoma, malignant Germ cell tumor

-cystic fibrosis
-channels do not answer
-abnormal membrane protein creates this faulty channel
-channels will not insert properly into the plasma membrane causing excess mucus and pneumonia
-digestive enzymes aren't working properly so poor digestion
-have high Na2+ nd Cl- levels on skin so a child will taste salty after birth

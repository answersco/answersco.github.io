Particulate and electromagnetic.
Particulate- transfers energy by means of fast-moving atomic or sub-atomic particles (electrons, protons, positrons, neutrons).
Electromagnetic- propagates energy in discrete photons with zero rest mass. EMR spectrum includes (in order of increasing wavelength): radio, microwave, infrared, visible, UV, x-ray, and gamma rays.

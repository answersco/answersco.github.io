title: "Why do we produce melanin?"
---
1)exposure to UV light stimulates melanin secretion and darkens skin
-the color fades as melanin is degraded and old cells are exfoliated
2)other pigments can influence skin color such as:
-hemoglobin: pigment in red blood cells that adds a reddish-pinkish hue to skin
-carotene: yellow pigment acquired from egg yolks and yellow/orange vegetables thats concentrated in stratum corneum and subcutaneous fat

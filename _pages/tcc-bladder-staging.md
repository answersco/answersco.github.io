TNM staging

Ta : non invasive papillary tumour
Tis : in situ (non invasive flat)
T1 : through lamina propria into sub-epithelial connective tissues
T2 : into muscularis propria
T2a : only invades inner half of the muscle
T2b : invades into outer half of the muscle
T3 : invasion into perivesical tissues
T3a : microscopic extravesical invasion
T3b : macroscopic extravesical invasion
T4 : direct invasion into adjacent structures
T4a : prostate, uterus, vaginal vault
T4b : pelvic side wall and / or abdominal wall

Nodal staging is the same for TCC of any part of the urinary tract.

N0 : no nodal involvement
N1 : single node involved &lt; 2cm
N2
single node 2 - 5cm OR
multiple nodes all &lt; 5cm 2-3
N3 : one or more nodes &gt; 5cm
M
M0 : no metastases
M1 : metastases identified
Staging groups
Individual TNM stages can then be grouped 3-4:

stage 0 : Ta or Tis, N0, M0
stage I : T1, N0, M0
stage II : T2(a or b), N0, M0
stage III : T3(a or b) or T4a, N0, M0
stage IV
T4b, any N, any M
N1-3, any T, any M

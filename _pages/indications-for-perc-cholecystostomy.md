title: "Indications for perc cholecystostomy"
---
-Valuable technique for treatment of patients with either calculous or acalculous cholecystitis who are critically ill and unfit for surgery. It is performed as a temporizing measure, with definitive surgery carried out later. For acalculous cholecystitis, perc chole may be curative, and may not require subsequent cholecystectomy.
-Also useful in management of empyema and hydrops of the GB.

-It has also be used for drainage of the biliary tree in patients whose cystic duct is patient and biliary obstruction lies below the insertion of the cystic duct into the CBD. Transhepatic drainage is a better alternative for long-term biliary drainage, but may be useful in pancreatitis for short-term decompression, and biliary cholangitis and distal CBD obstruction with failed ERCP.

-Transhepatic preferred for long-term palliation of obstructive jaundice because stenting can be performed easily through the transhepatic tract. It is difficult to manipulate a wire through cystic duct into CBD using a gallbladder approach.

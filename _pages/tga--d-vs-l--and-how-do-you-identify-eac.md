title: "TGA: D vs L, and how do you identify each ventricle?"
---
TGA: most common cause of cyanosis during 1st 24 hours of life, associated with diabetic mothers.

Right ventricle: defined by moderator band
Survival depends on ASD, VSD, or PDA (most commonly VSD)

D-transposition: &quot;egg on a string&quot;
-PDA may be only connection between the 2 systems, which would otherwise be incompatible with life. 

L-transposition: &quot;Luck&quot; that it congenitally corrects
&quot;Double discordance&quot; - atrium hooks up with wrong ventricle, and ventricles hook up with wrong vessels.
-Doesn't require PDA for survival.

Corrected D-transposition: PA draped over aorta (LeCompte Maneuver)

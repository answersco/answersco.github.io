title: "Oxygen effect on growth"
---
-O2 needed for energy metabolism (cellular respiration) by some microbes
-other microbes use alternative energy pathways that do not require O2 such as fermentation or anaerobic respiration 
-sometimes oxygen is not required and sometime may be toxic to microbe which means there is a lack of dismutase and catalase enzymes

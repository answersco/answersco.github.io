title: "Malignant fibrous histeocytoma"
---
New name is Pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma
Think of these as a fibrotic tumor ,i.e., T1 AND T2 dark (however they can definitely also be T1 bright)
These have a tendancy to bleed so dont be surprised if you signs of blood products on MRI
These favor old people in central (proximal) locations

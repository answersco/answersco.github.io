title: "How does collimation affect KAP and entrance skin Kerma"
---
KAP decreases
- decreases cross sectional area, and minimally increases dose - not enough to cancel out
- KAP = dose x cross sectional area

Entrance skin kerma is increased
- Automatic brightness control minimally increases mA (dose)

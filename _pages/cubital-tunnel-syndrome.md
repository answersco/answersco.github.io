title: "Cubital tunnel syndrome"
---
This is compression of the ulnar nerve near the elbow when it passes through the cubital tunnel (retinaculum) which is also known as the epicondylo-olecronon ligament.

The most common cause if repetitive valgus stress.
This can also be due to an extra muscle called the &quot;accessory anconeus&quot;

This is compression of the ulnar nerve near the elbow when it passes through the cubital tunnel (retinaculum) which is also known as the epicondylo-olecronon ligament.

The most common cause if repetitive valgus stress.
This can also be due to an extra muscle called the &quot;accessory anconeus&quot; (you can see this on the picture)

Caused by an accessory anconeus muscle on (anconeus epitrochlearis) on medial side which exerts mass effect on the ulnar nerve at Osborne's ligament

Cubital tunnel syndrome: secondary to repetitive valgus stress
Site where ulnar nerve passes beneath cubital tunnel retinaculum is also known as the epicondylo-olecranon ligament or Osborne band.
Can occur from compression by any pathology
If it occurs from an accessory muscle, it is classically the anconeus epitrochlearis

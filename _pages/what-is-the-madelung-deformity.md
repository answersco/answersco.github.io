title: "What is the madelung deformity?"
---
Shortened distal radius (due to defective growth plate of ulnar 3rd of distal radius), which demonstrates abnormal ulnar tilt of its distal articular surface (idiopathic or prior trauma)

Increased interosseous space and dorsal subluxation of the distal radio-ulnar joint

Exaggerated plantar and ulnar tilt

* Associated with ulnocarpal abutment (ulnar still grows, so you essentially get abutment and TFCC damage)

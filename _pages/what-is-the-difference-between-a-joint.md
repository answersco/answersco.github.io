title: "What is the difference between a joint, a ligament, and a tendon?"
---
a joint is the connection made between bones in the body

a ligament is PART OF the joint (ie, the ACL is part of the KNEE JOINT - it is the fibrous tissue that connects the 2 bones. HOWEVER, a joint is made up of more than just a ligament - it also can contain cartilage

a tendon is the actual fibrous connective tissue which attaches muscle to bone. NOTE: tendons can also connect muscle to other structures besides bone, such as the EYEBALL

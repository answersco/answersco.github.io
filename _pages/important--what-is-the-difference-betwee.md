title: "IMPORTANT: What is the difference between paramagnetic and diamagnetic?"
---
Diamagnetic = no unpaired electrons = Materials that create an induced magnetic field in a direction opposite to an externally applied magnetic field and are therefore repelled by the applied magnetic field.
(oxyHb)

Paramagnetic = HAS unpaired electrons. Because of this, it is attracted by an externally applied magnetic field and form internal, induced magnetic fields in the direction of the applied magnetic field
(DeoxyHb = paramagnetic = alters T2<b> MRI signal and is more hypointense on T2</b> than oxyHb which is diamagnetic) 
- OxyHb has less T2* effect because the O2 shields the Hb iron atoms and reduces dephasing of adjacent protons
- Will cause local shortened T1 time (e.g. that's how Gd works!)

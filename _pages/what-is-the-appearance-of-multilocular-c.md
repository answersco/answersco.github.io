Michael Jackson lesion!

- Tumor of the renal MEDULLA
- Non-communicating, fluid filled locules surrounded by thick fibrous capsule
* Note, there is NO solid component or necrosis
* May protrude into the renal pelvis
* RESECT because cannot distinguish between cystic RCC (but no need for chemotherapy)

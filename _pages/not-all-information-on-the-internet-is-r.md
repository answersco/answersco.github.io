title: "Not all information on the Internet is reliable."
---
The Internet has become a quick and easy way to find information on just about any topic. When using the Internet to do research, however, you must be careful of the source. Just because someone has posted information on a website, it doesn't mean the person is an expert. Anyone can offer his opinion as fact on the Internet. Official websites of the government, newspapers, colleges, and professional organizations may have more reliable information than other sites. If you compare several sites and find the same facts, you can be more confident the information is correct.

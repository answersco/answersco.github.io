title: "1. DR(Flat Panel Detector): Indirect   -xray activeates the thallium doped cesium iodide which emits light.  -the photodiode turns the light into an electric charge which can then be read out by the TFT array  -If the CsI is too thick then you lose information laterally due to lateral dispersion.  -Increased crystal thickness-&gt;worse spatial resolution  -if the CsI crystal is too thin then you decrease the sensitivity for collecting the xrays (they fly right through)  -Gad Oxysulfide phosphor crystal has more lateral dispersion than CsI  -fix lateral dispersion by using a columnar structure  -TFT array -&gt; thin film transitor: active elecrtonic elements  -scintillators-&gt;xrays-&gt;light-&gt;charge (scintillators are more efficient in xray absorption than a phosphor. Scintillators also produce more visible light per xray and emit a wavelength of light that is a better match for the TFT detector)  ===================  2. DR (Flat Panel Detectors): <b>Direct</b> -&gt; &quot;digital detector&quot;  - Able to turn an xray into electric charge without making it light first. Does this via Amorphous selenium.  -The selenium is first given a charge and then the xrays hit the selenium releasing electrons that will go neutralize &quot;electron hole pairs&quot; in proportion to the xray intensity.   -No lateral dispersion so better resolution  -The charge is then stored in the charge storage capacitor electrodes that connect to the TFT. the charge is scanned and converted to a digital signal stored by each TFT.  -&gt;Digital to analog converter to display the image on a monitor  -photon from the xray is stored as an electric charge within a square array of pixels  -Detector fill factor: this is the area of the detector which is sensitive to xrays.  -Higher fill factor-&gt;more efficient the detector  -Fill Factor = Active area/Total detector area  ================= 3. CR (storage phospher):   -phosphor detector uses PMT and photodiode -e- in the metastable state holds the latent image which is then read out by a red point laser (incident xray) that counts the amount of blue-green light emitted as the electron falls from its metastable state.  -The amount of detected light = intensity of the incident xray.  -The phosphor detector plate is reset by forceable exposure to bright white light  -Erases the detector -Ghosting artifact"

title: "Reflexes"
---
-evaluated by advanced practitioners using a reflex hammer
-assesses deep tendon and cutaneous reflexes-eliciting reflex reaction provide data about the integrity of sensory and motor pathways of the reflex arch and specific spinal cord segments
-each muscle contains a unit called a muscle spindle which control the muscle tone and changes in the length of the muscle fibers
-when you tap a tendon with the reflex hammer, it stretches the muscle and tendon, lengthening the spindle
-when assessing reflexes, the pt needs be to as relaxed as possible - hard for someone bedbound, hold reflex hammer loosely
-normally older person presents with diminished reflex
-hyperactive reflexes meaning their kicking hard which can be seen in somebody with alcohol, cocaine, or opioid intoxication
-any person with hyper-magnesium can lose deep tendon reflexes

-genetically wired, involuntary responses that are crucial for infant survival
EX. sucking, rooting, gripping, toe curling, startle, and galant

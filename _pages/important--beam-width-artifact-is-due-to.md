title: "IMPORTANT: Beam width artifact is due to? Ex? How to improve it?"

Due to divergence of the beam in the far field hitting a strong reflector that sends signal back (which is then assumed to be from the main beam)

- Ex) Peripheral echoes in the urinary bladder

- Improve by adjusting your focal zone &amp; placing transducer at center of image

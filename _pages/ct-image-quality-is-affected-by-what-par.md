title: "CT image quality is affected by what parameters?"
---
mAs (dose): increased photons increases SNR and increases resolution
pixel size: larger pixels improve contrast res. but decrease spatial res.
slice thickness: greater thickness =improved contrast res.
reconstruction filter
patient size: greater size results in diminished contrast resolution (inc attenuation); degraded spatial resolution because have to incr. FOV
gantry rotation speed: minimizes motion if fast, so resolution increases
pitch

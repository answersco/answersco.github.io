title: "IF they give you US beam attenuation of a material is 5 dB/cm, what % remains after 6 cm?"
---
Step 1. Multiply the distance by the attenuation = 30 dB of attenuation

Step 2. Remember that for every 10 dB, you go down to 10% of your original

Therefore, 10 dB is 1/10th, 20 dB is 1/100th, and 30 dB is 1/1000th of original beam

(1/1000th = .1%)

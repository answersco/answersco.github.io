title: "Unsharpness of images (fluoro)"
---
1. Geometric (like we've talking about)
2. Patient (varying thickness of the patient - typically with DECREASED attenuation at the edges of an image which produces INDISTINCT edges)
3. Receptor (limitations in thes ystem to record exact locations)
&#8212;Receptor unsharpness is the ULTIMATE limit on resolution
&#8212;Resolution in a digital system is limited by the SIZE of the pixels

Relationship between intrinsic RECEPTOR resolution and FOCAL spot size (R/F) will determine if geometric magnification will increase or decrease the spatial resolution
&#8212;R/F &gt; 0.5 then magnification will REDUCE unsharpness i.e. INCREASE spatial resolution
&#8212;R/F &lt; 0.5 then magnification will INCREASE unsharpness i.e. DECREASE spatial resolution

Practically speaking, the way we can MAG in breast (this is geometric mag) and INCREASE resolution is the fact that the focal spot is SUPER SMALL (0.3 mm in breast vs 1 mm in other forms of imaging)

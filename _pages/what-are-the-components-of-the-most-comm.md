Superconductive Magnet&#8594; an electromagnet whose coils are wound with superconductive wire.
Superconductive wire&#8594; typically consists of several strands of special material (usually NbTi or less commonly Nb3Sn alloy) embedded in a copper matrix forming an external shell.
After the wire is cooled below its transition temperature&#8594; the alloy strands lose their electrical resistance&#8594; become superconductive.
The superconductive coils are immersed in liquid helium (He) to maintain steady and stable operational temperature (4.2 K)

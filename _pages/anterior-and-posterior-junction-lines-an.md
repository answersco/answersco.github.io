title: "Anterior and posterior junction lines and significance of abnormal contour:"
---
Anterior junction line: formed by 4 layers of pleura at the anterior junction of the right and left lungs
Frontal XR: vertical line projecting over the superior &#8532; of the sternum
Abnormal convexity/displacement: suggests anterior mediastinal mass

Posterior junction line: formed by 4 layers of pleura at the posterior junction of the left and right lungs
Frontal XR: vertical line projecting through the trachea, more superior than anterior junction line. Unlike anterior junction line, the posterior junction line is seen above the clavicles (posterior lungs extend more superiorly than anterior lungs)
Abnormal convexity/displacement: suggests posterior mediastinal mass or aortic aneurysm.

1) cardioversion and defibrillation: caused by us putting electrical currents in the heart to stop dysrhythmias 
2) ablation: go in with cardiac catheter and see where the dysrhythmias is happening and burn those cells
3) pacemakers: keep heart rate at certain rate or defibrillate a person when they go into ventricular dysrhythmias
4) implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD)

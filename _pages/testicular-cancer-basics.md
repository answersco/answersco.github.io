US: If you see hypoechoic intratesticular mass, then this is testicular cancer until proven otherwise
Remember, testicular cancer typically mets via the lymphatics to the retropertinoeal lymph nodes to the level of the renval veins (EXCEPTION is choriocarcinoma)

IF you see mets to the external iliac nodes, pelvic, or inguinal nodes, then this is considered NON-REGIONAL disease which increases the stage to M1

Elevate bHCG: seminoma and choriocarcinoma

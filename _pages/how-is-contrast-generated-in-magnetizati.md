title: "How is contrast generated in magnetization transfer (MT) MRI?"
---
MT contrast arises from the application of an additional off-resonance RF pulse &#8594; this pulse selectively saturates macromolecule-bound protons and partially saturates MRI-visible free water protons through magnetization exchange between these 2 distinct proton pools.
This exchange of magnetization&#8594; allows the presence of the macromolecular proton pool and the degree of exchange to be observed through the effect on the observed water signal.

title: "Clinical presentation and evaluation of functional and anatomic popliteal artery entrapment"
---
Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome: presents initially as calf and foot claudication during activity.
-Functional entrapment: F:M 2:1, mean of 26 years, bilateral in 14%. 
Patients usually highly trained athletes, especially runners. 
Resting ABIs are normal, but 40% note paresthesias

-Anatomic entrapment: 70% males, mean age of 35.
More severe claudication at lower levels of exertion than functional entrapment. Only 14% with paresthesias.
Anatomic abnormality bilateral in 1/3, but not always symptomatic on both sides.
Risk for thrombosis (25%) with embo to tibial arteries
Resting ABI abnormal in 30%, indicative of distal embolization.
May have post-stenotic dilatation or aneurysm.

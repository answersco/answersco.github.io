Annuloaortic ectasia with dilatation of aortic root.
Dilatation of root may lead to aortic valve insufficiency, regurgitation, and possibly root dissection or rupture.
Ascending aortic aneurysm described as &quot;tulip bulb&quot;
Typically repaired earlier than normal aneurysm (usually around 5.5 cm)

May get recurrent dissections, including a triple-barreled dissection (both sides of true channel)

Pulmonary artery enlargement: also favors the root.

Loeys-Dietz Syndrome: variant with worse prognosis, commonly rupturing aorta.

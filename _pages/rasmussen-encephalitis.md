title: "Rasmussen encephalitis"
---
Rasmussen encephalitis (RE) (not to be confused with a Rasmussen aneurysm) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown origin, usually affecting one brain hemisphere.

Epidemiology
Children of ten years or younger age group are affected in 85% cases1. However, disease detection rate in adults is increasing, with routine MRI investigations in intractable seizure patients5.

Pathology
Pathologic features are similar to viral encephalitis, with lymphocytes around round cells, and diffuse proliferation of microglia. However, later spongiform degeneration and cortical atrophy sets in.

Aetiology
Exact cause of the disease is unknown, however various viral (SSPE like, EBV or CMV), or inflammatory episodes have been implicated by different authors3, 4, 6.

Clinical features
Patients frequently have episodes of epilepsia partialis continua and, much less frequently, generalized status epilepticus. The seizures are intractable despite aggressive medical management 1.

Apart from seizures, patient may have hemiparesis, and speech disturbances, as well as hemianopia (pertaining to unilateral cerebral involvement). Mental deterioration over time may also be seen, especially in patient presenting later in younghood.

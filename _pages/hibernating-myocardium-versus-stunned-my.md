title: "Hibernating myocardium versus stunned myocardium?"
---
Hibernating: High-grade stenosis resulting in chronically ischemic myocardium. May act like postinfarction scar. Improved function with revascularization. At risk for acute infarction. Stunned myocardium: Postischemic, dysfunctional myocardium without complete necrosis. Potentially salvageable.

Optic neuritis&#8594; most commonly from MS, but can also be secondary to viral infection, sarcoidosis, vasculitis, and toxin exposure
Typically presents with painful subacute vision loss and reduced color perception.
Acutely&#8594; optic nerve elongation and T2 prolongation, with enhancement suggesting active disease.
Chronically&#8594; optic nerve atrophies.

70% unilateral
Painful
Enhancement of optic nerve without enlargement of the nerve/sheath complex.
Often seen intracranial or cord demyelination in setting of Devic (neuromyelitis optica).

pain with eye movement
visual loss
MR: enhancement of nerve, obliteration of perioptic space

Causes:
MS
 Devic's syndrome (NMO)- bilateral optic neuritis with 
 transverse myelitis
Ischemia
Vasculitis

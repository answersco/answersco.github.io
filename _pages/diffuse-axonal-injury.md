title: "Diffuse Axonal Injury"
---
1. Grey white matter junction

2. Corpus callosum

3. Brainstem

Widespread injury to axons within the brain
Grading:
G1 = grey-white interface
G2 = Corpus collosum 
G3 = Brainstem (really bad)

MRI:
- look for areas of susceptibility artifact in the characteristic locations
- Look for HIGH flair signal that corresponds to these areas

-head CT normal
-GRE - hemorrhagic DAI
-T2/FLAIR - nonhemorrhagic DAI
-restricted diffusion

Grade 1: grey-white matter interface
Grade 2: corpus callosum
Grade 3: dorsolateral midbrain (worst)

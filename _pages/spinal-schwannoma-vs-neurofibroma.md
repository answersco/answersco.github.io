title: "Spinal schwannoma vs neurofibroma"
---
Schwannoma: most common extramedullary, intradural tumor
Benign, usually solitary, usually arising from dorsal nerve roots.
Multiple in NF-2 and Carney Complex
Appearance: variable, but classically dumbbell-shaped with the skinny handle being the intraforaminal component. 
T1 dark, T2 bright, and enhance
Look a lot like neurofibromas, but central necrosis or hemorrhage favors schwannoma.

Neurofibroma: composed of all parts of nerve (nerve + sheath).
Usually solitary, others plexiform.
Plexiform: multilevel bulky nerve enlargement that is pathognomonic for NF1.
5-10% malignant degeneration (see rapid growth)
T2 hyperintense rim with central area of low signal = target sign - favors neurofibroma

title: "Magnetic susceptibility, and how to improve it"
---
Susceptibility = ability of substance to be magnetized by the external field.
-Worse with GRE than SE (because of 180 degree refocusing pulse to lose T2* effects)
-Worse on in phase than out of phase. This is because in phase is performed later, and the longer the TE, the more susceptibility.

Making it better: use SE and FSE instead of GRE
-Swap phase and frequency
-Use wider receiver bandwidth
-Align the longitudinal axis of the metal implant with the axis of the main field
-Use STIR for fat-suppression

title: "In MRI, you can increase all of these to increase your SNR, EXCEPT?  (FOV, Matrix size, slice thickness, field strength, or signal averages via # excitations)"

Matrix size (increasing this will decrease your pixels, which decrease your SNR but improves your spatial resolution)

Increased SNR by increasing FOV, slice thickness, signal averages, and field strength

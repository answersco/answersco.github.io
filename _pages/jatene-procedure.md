title: "Jatene procedure"
---
The pulmonary artery and the aorta are surgically exchanged at their roots so that each comes from the appropriate ventricle in cases of d-transposition of the great vessels. The great arteries are usually arranged using the Lecompte maneuver: the pulmonary artery is anterior to the ascending aorta.

Jatene: another arterial switch method 
Involves transection of the aorta and PAs about the valve sinuses, including removal of the coronaries.
The great arteries are switched.
The coronaries are sewn into the new aorta (formerly the PA).
Very difficult.
Advantages: LV is systemic ventricle, and no conduit to go bad.

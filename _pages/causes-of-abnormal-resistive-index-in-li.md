---
Normal: 0.5-0.7 = V1 (systolic) - V2 (diastolic) / V1
Elevated RI (&gt; 0.7)
May be normal if isolated finding &#8594; not specific for liver disease
Post-prandial state
Advanced age.
Diffuse distal microvascular disease (including chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis).
Hepatic congestion (acute or chronic)
Transplant rejection.
Low RI (&lt; 0.5) &#8594; either from proximal stenosis or distal vascular shunting.
Arteriovenous or arterioportal fistulas in cirrhosis (so RI may be high, normal, or low in cirrhosis).
Trauma (post liver biopsy)
Osler-Weber-Rendu
Proximal arterial narrowing: atherosclerotic, transplant anastomosis, severe MALS.

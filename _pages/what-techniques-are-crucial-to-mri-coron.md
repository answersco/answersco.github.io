D. All of the above. Cardiac gating is used in all Cardiac MRI, but is especially important in coronary angiography due to the small size of the coronary arteries. Navigator echoes decrease the motion effect of breathing. The least amount of heart motion is during mid-diastole, so imaging is done at this point.

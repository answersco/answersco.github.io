title: "1. CT fluoroscopy used for placement of percutaneous needle and RF electrode 2. Tissue heating results from resistive energy loss as electrons agitate ionic molecules in tissue to move towards the electrode 3. Goal is to heat tissue/tumor to 60-100&#8304; Celsius = heat is lethal to target tissue. Time = between 4-12 minutes. Internal thermocouple measures temperature of tissue. 4. Normal adjacent tissue is protected by heat sink created by surrounding vessels and adjacent tissues"

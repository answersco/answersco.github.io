title: "TB: primary progressive"
---
Local progression of parenchymal disease with the development of CAVITATION (also seen in post-primary/reactivation) at the initial site of infection or hematogenous spread.
Uncommon: main risk factor is HIV, transplant, steroids, jejunoileal bypass, subtotal gastrectomy, and silicosis.
Similar course to post-primary disease.

This is where the PRIMARY infection does not become latent. This is MUCH more common in immunocompromised people (basically anything that causes your immune system to go down like AIDS)

The spread can be endobronchial or it can be hematogenous:

IF endobronchial, probs going to get CAVITATION
IF hematogenous, probs going to get MILIARY (image) - typically smallnodules that are uniform in size and distribution

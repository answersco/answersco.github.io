title: "Methods to limit patient exposure in fluoroscopy:"
---
Pulsed fluoroscopy with low frame rates
Minimize electronic magnification
Collimating the beam
Minimizing fluoro time
Shortening the distance between the patient and the image receptor (image intensifier or flat-panel detector)
Reduce peak skin dose by using multiple gantry angles and maximizing the distance between the patient and the x-ray source.

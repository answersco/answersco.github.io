title: "Femoral artery access site and complications:"

Femoral arterial access: common femoral artery begins below the inguinal ligament
Ideal position: inferomedial margin of the femoral head, where the femoral artery and nerve are side-by-side.
Puncture performed too low: femoral vein may be traversed&#8594; possible AVF, as vein often passes deep to (instead of medial to) the artery distal to standard access site.
Puncture too high: &#8593; risk of retroperitoneal hematoma (especially if punctured above the pelvic brim).
Pseudoaneurysm: swirling yin-yang on color Doppler with high-velocity flow at the site of communication with the femoral artery.
Pseudoaneurysm &lt; 1 cm: watchful waiting can be performed
AV fistula: Doppler shows arterial flow within the vein, and loss of the normal triphasic waveform in the artery
&#8593; diastolic flow often seen in artery proximal to fistula
Pseudoaneurysm &gt; 1 cm: US-guided thrombin injection is treatment of choice, alternatively US-guided compression of the neck of the pseudoaneurysm.

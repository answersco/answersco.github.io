-overall positive but declines with increasing age

-do not project it is horrible for them

-by mid-80s, they are reporting less satisfaction with health perception but not with function

-self-reporting of limitations declining in recent years b/c do not want to go to nursing home so less likely to complain - do not want to be that &quot;old person&quot;

-we are doing a better job at prevention

title: "MRI of uterine leiomyoma:"
---
Leiomyoma/fibroid: often multiple
May be intramural (within the myometrial wall), submucosal (directly underneath the endometrial mucosa), or subserosal (directly underneath the outer uterine serosa).
Imaging: small fibroids are T2-hypointense due to compact smooth muscle
Cystic or myxoid degeneration may &#8593; T2 signal heterogeneously
Carneous or hemorrhagic degeneration may appear hyperintense on T1
Malignant leiomyosarcoma: very rare, and may arise de-novo or from malignant degeneration of a fibroid. Imaging cannot reliably differentiate from fibroid unless evidence of invasion or metastatic disease.
Hemorrhagic or necrotic leiomyomas: not treated effectively by UAE.
Ovarian-uterine artery anastomosis also decreases likelihood of UAE success

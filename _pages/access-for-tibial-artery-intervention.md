Optimal approach: antegrade from ipsilateral CFA
-If this isn't possible, the use of a long, flexible sheath or guiding catheter placed over the Ao bifurcation is necessary to provide stability and allow contrast injection.
-Positioning sheath or guiding catheter in SFA improves deliver of contrast to target area.
-Extra-long shaft balloons are necessary when working over the bifurcation or in the pedal arteries.
-Rapid-exchange balloon catheters are also useful.

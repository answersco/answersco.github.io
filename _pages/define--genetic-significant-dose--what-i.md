title: "Define: Genetic significant dose? What is the dose?"
---
genetically significant dose (GSD) is the dose that if given to everyone in the U.S. population would result in the same number of mutations as would the actual variable dose received by part of the population during medical irradiation. The GSD is about 0.25 mSv.

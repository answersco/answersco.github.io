title: "Motion correction with breast MRI"
---
Breathing and cardiac motion would normally degrade the image on breast MRI
-Corrected by running the phase-encoding direction side-to-side rather than front to back (like in body imaging).
-Axial: phase encoding direction is left to right
-Sagittal: breast is top to bottom for phase-encoding.

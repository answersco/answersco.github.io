title: "Imaging US of semi lobar holoprosencephaly?"
---
Clearly separate occipital lobes, but the frontal lobes are fused and the cavum septi pellucidi is absent. The falx is present posteriorly but absent anteriorly. 

Semi lobar holoprosencephaly is intermediate in severity between the alobar (most severe) and lobar (mildest) forms.

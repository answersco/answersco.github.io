title: "Silicosis and coal-workers pneumoconiosis (CWP):"
---
Pneumoconiosis: lung disease secondary to inorganic dust inhalation (versus organic dust inhalation in HST)
Silicosis and coal-workers pneumoconiosis (CWP): most common pneumoconioses, and often have indistinguishable imaging findings.
Silicosis: due to inhalation of silica dust, commonly in miners.
CWP: inhalation of coal dust.
Uncomplicated disease: most characteristic finding is multiple upper-lobe predominant centrilobular and subpleural nodules. 
Eggshell LN calcifications are commonly seen in silicosis, less commonly in CWP
Complicated disease: large, conglomerate masses or progressive massive fibrosis.
Both confer increased risk of TB.
Caplan syndrome: seen in patients with RA and either CWP or silicosis
Represents necrobiotic rheumatoid nodules superimposed on the smaller centrilobular and subpleural nodules of the pneumoconiosis.

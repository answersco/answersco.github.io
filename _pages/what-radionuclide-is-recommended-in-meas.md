title: "What radionuclide is recommended in measuring constancy"

Cs-137 (100 &#956;Ci) is strongly recommended because the 30 year half-life will assure use of the same source throughout the life of the calibrator, and is readily available (remember there is a decay correction so even though it has a half life the decay is still accounted for)

: the test passed because the activity is generally the same from day to day

Granuloma (Ghon focus)
Can have nodal expansion (bulkier in kids) which can calcify (Ranke Complex = calcified granuloma + calcified hilar node)
Bulky nodes can cause compression: atelectasis (usually lobar)
If the node ruptures, you can have endobronchial or hematogenous (leads to miliary pattern) spread.

Cavitation is RARE in primary setting
Effusions uncommon in kids, more in adults.

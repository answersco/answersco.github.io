title: "How is quality of the magnetic field specified and measured?"
---
Quality of the magnetic field&#8594; specified by indicating the largest value of inhomogeneity inside a spherical volume of specified diameter&#8594; DSV (diameter of spherical volume)

Due to variable computation methods, the peak-to-peak (PP) method is often used
PP method&#8594; reports the difference between the largest and smallest value of the magnetic field within the specified DSV

Typical MRI magnets today have inhomogeneity in the range of 5-10 ppm PP over 40 cm DSV
The larger the body part, the more critical the need for homogeneity

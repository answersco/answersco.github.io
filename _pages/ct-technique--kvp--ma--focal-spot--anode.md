title: "CT technique: kVp, mA, focal spot, anode-cathode axis, variable mA"

3rd generation CT: x-ray tube and detectors rotate in synchrony
-X-ray tubes use tungsten alloy targets placed on high-speed rotating anodes
-Reasonable voltage (80-140 kV, usually ~120). Peds and skinny patients kVp ~80 (reduces dose, increases image contrast). Higher for large patients.
-Very high tube currents (up to 1000 mA)
-Typical focal spot is large (0.6-1.2 mm) in order to handle the large amount of power (~100 kW)
-Filtration performed to remove low-energy x-rays that would only increase dose
-X-rays are highly-filtered, high kV (average energy 75 keV)
-X-ray tube anode-cathode axis is positioned perpendicular to the imaging plane to reduce the heel effect.

Variable mA: adjusted via scout image or continuous tube modulation.
Reduces radiation and gives more uniform SNR

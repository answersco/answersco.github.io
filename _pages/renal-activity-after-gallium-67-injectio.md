title: "Renal activity after gallium-67 injection should be considered abnormal after how long? What are the causes?"
---
After 24 hours (normally excretes so it's normal to see kidney activity til 24 hours)

- If still present 24 hours later, then think obstruction, acute renal failure (interstitial nephritis), CRF, pyelonephritis, or renal neoplasm

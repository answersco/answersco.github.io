title: "Cardiac sarcoidosis"
---
Seen in 5% of cases, associated with increased risk of death.
Increased signal on T2 and early Gd images.
Late Gd: middle and epicardial in non-coronary distribution. 
Focal wall thickening from edema can mimic HOCM.
Often involves the septum.

RV and papillaries are RARELY affected.

Sarcoidosis: involves heart in ~25% of patients
May appear as focal bright T2-signal in the myocardium&#8594; most commonly involves LV free wall and basilar septum
Sarcoid granulomas: typically demonstrate DHE that parallel areas of abnormal T2 signal
Commonly in a patchy midwall and epicardial/subepicardial distribution and along RV border of IV septum.

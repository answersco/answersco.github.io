title: "Endovascular options for management of hepatic encephalopathy after TIPS:"
---
Include the use of a constricted, covered stent to reduce the diameter of the TIPS; coil embolization of physiologic portosystemic shunts; and coil embolization of the TIPS.

Endovascular reduction of the TIPS may be accomplished via a new covered stent, constricted in the middle by sutures, within the pre-existing TIPS; or placement of 2 new stents within the TIPS.

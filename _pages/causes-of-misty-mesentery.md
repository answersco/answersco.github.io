title: "Causes of misty mesentery:"
---
Mesenteric edema: due to systemic or intra-abdominal etiologies
Systemic: CHF, low-protein states, and 3rd spacing&#8594; diffuse mesenteric edema
Focal mesenteric edema: may be secondary to an intra-abdominal vascular cause, such as mesenteric vessel thrombosis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, or IVC obstruction.

Mesenteric inflammation: pancreatitis, appendicitis, IBD, diverticulitis
Mesenteric panniculitis: idiopathic inflammatory condition with diffuse misty mesentery
Intra-abdominal hemorrhage: tends to be localized

Neoplastic infiltration: most commonly due to NHL, which also causes bulky adenopathy
Mesenteric involvement may be especially apparent after treatment
Other tumors with mesenteric involvement include colon, breast, GIST, and mesothelioma

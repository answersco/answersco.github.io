Holoprosencephaly (HPS): forebrain doesn't divide into 2 hemispheres
Associated with:
Midline maxillofacial abnormalities, including a single central incisor
Azygos configuration of ACA (single ACA)
Alobar: most severe
Complete lack of separation of cerebral hemispheres
Single large monoventricle almost always communicates with a large dorsal cyst
Semilobar&#8594; features at least some degree of separation of the posterior cerebral hemispheres.
Similar to alobar HPS, the anterior hemispheres also fail to separate
Also usually large midline posterior interhemispheric cyst
Lobar&#8594; mildest form 
Only the most rostral aspects of the frontal neocortex are not separated
Corpus callosum is absent in the affected region anteriorly, but the posterior corpus callosum (splenium and posterior body) is present

Midline developmental anomaly, three forms (alobar, semilobar, lobar).

monovent, fused thalami, dorsal cyst, confluent anterior cortex, hippocampal ridges

Failure of midline cleavage. Alobar form with fused thalami, single ventricle with large dorsal cyst.
Associated with trisomy 13, facial hypoplasia, midline facial anomalies/cleft

Failure of midline cleavage of the primitive prosencephalon in early development.

Single ventricle
Absent or partial hemispheric and basal cleavage with absent/incomplete interhemispheric fissure/falx
Azygous anterior cerebral artery (ACA)
&#177; associated facial defects

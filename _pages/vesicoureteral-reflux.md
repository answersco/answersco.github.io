title: "Vesicoureteral Reflux"
---
Retrograde flow of urine from bladder toward 1 or both kidneys
I: Reflux into ureter not reaching renal pelvis
II: Reflux reaching pelvis but no blunting of calyces
III: Mild calyceal blunting
IV: Progressive calyceal and ureteral dilation

VCUG preferred whenever anatomic detail of upper tracts is needed and in all cases when urethral anatomy is being evaluated
Nuclear cystogram preferred when anatomy is known and for follow-up studies

title: "Image data compression: lossless technique"
---
Image data compression is a method to reduce the amount of data used to record an image, using fewer bits than the original representation while maintaining the diagnostic qualities of the image.

Lossless compression: uses various algorithms to decrease statistical redundancy in order to display data without loss of information, possible because of the inherently repetitive nature of some digital information. GIF uses lossless technique. 
Limiting factor: some upper end limit on compression ratios, usually 3:1

title: "MM detectors: analog"
---
-Film/screen:
Intensifying screens made of gadolinium oxysulfide (Gd2O2S)
Single emulsion (eliminates crossover and parallax)
High film gradients (&gt; 3.0) and thus low film latitude
Optimal film densities in MM are between 1.6 and 2.0 (higher than in radiography) &#8594; higher OD required to achieve high contrast (requiring viewboxes to have higher luminance).
-Photostimulable phosphor plate (hybrid analog/digital)

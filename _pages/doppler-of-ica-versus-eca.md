title: "Doppler of ICA versus ECA"
---
Brain is always &quot;on&quot; - needs constant diastolic flow

ICA: low resistance
Low systolic velocity
Diastolic velocity does NOT return to baseline
Continuous color flow throughout the cardiac cycle
ICA occlusion: CCA waveform looks like ECA

ECA: high resistance
High systolic velocity
Diastolic velocity approaches zero baseline
Color flow intermittent during cardiac cycle.
&quot;Temporal tap&quot; - tap temporal artery and look for ripples in the spectrum (labeled &quot;TT&quot;)

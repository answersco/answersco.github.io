title: "Dose and technique"
---
Peak Tube voltage: 
Dose linearly related to mA and mAs
Kvp2 (squared) related to skin dose but less so to pt bc depends on size (smaller pt gets more dose)
Pitch: 
Beam Width: 
Dose Modulation Current: 
Geometric Efficiency: thinner beam and tighter collimation more radiation wasting - use more detectors
Shielding: ie Bismuth w Breast/chest CT- placed on after scout d/t dose modulation - causes artifact, waste dose, prefer other technique changes
Reconstructions: 
Allow scanning at lower doses, esp w iterative- recon thinner slices
Filters: attenuate low W photons
Patient Size: peds
Scan Length
Number of scans (at once or in short hospital stay)
Genetic Susceptibility: Ataxia-Telangiectasia and DM

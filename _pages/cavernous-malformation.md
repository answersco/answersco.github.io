Cavernous malformation (cavernoma)
Very small, but definite bleeding risk, higher in presence of DVA
Multiple in familial cavernomatosis
Can be induced by XRT to the brain
NECT: well-circumscribed, rounded, hyperattenuating lesion
MRI: &quot;popcorn-like&quot; appearance of lobular mixed T1 and T2 signal from blood products of various ages. Peripheral rim of hemosiderin which is dark on T2 and GRE. Typically no enhancement, but may be seen after delay.
Usually occult by vascular imaging.

circumferential hemosiderin ring, can see associated dural venous anomalies

abnormal collection of blood vessels with no well-defined feeding arteries or draining veins.
These do NOT have intervening normal brain parynchyma
They can ooze but often do not lead to catastrophic bleed
Buzzword = popcorn like with peripheral rim of hemosiderin
FLUID FLUID level means that it has RECENTLY BLED 
Remember it is not uncommon to see a DVA near by

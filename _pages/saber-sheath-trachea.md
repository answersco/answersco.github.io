Coronal (trv) diameter &lt; 2/3 the sagittal (AP) diameter
Strong association with COPD
Main bronchi normal in size
Tracheal wall normal thickness

Coronal diameter is less than two thirds of sagittal diameter. Affects older men with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Pathognomonic for COPD
Coronal narrowing of the INTRATHORACIC trachea with SPARING of the extrathoracic trachea
These findings make sense because they are related to to hyperexpansion

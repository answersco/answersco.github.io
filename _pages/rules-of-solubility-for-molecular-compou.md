1) if solute is nonpolar and solvent is polar, than no solution
(EX. hydrocarbon + water)
2) if solute is polar and solvent is nonpolar, then no solution
(EX. ethanol + benzene)
3) if solute and solvent are both polar, then solution
(EX. ethanol + water)
4) if solute and solvent are both nonpolar, then solution
(EX. hydrocarbon + benzene)

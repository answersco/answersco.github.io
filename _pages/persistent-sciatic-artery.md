title: "Persistent sciatic artery?"
---
Rare vascular anomoly where fetal sciatic artery persists to supply the majority of blood supply to the leg

External iliac occluded but in tact distal pulses and large continuation of internal iliac down the leg

Persistent sciatic artery: rare anomaly where the fetal sciatic artery persists to supply the majority of blood supply to the lower extremity
Arises from the internal iliac artery (usually from the inferior gluteal artery) and continues distally to the popliteal artery.
May have a rudimentary femoral artery
Persistent sciatic artery may predispose to aneurysm formation

Rare variant of SFA anatomy
-Normal fetal branch of the IIA that continues into the LE posterior to the femoral head to supply the runoff vessels
-This artery usually regresses as the EIA becomes the arterial supply of the leg
-When persistent, the sciatic artery may terminate in the posterior thigh, in which case the runoff is through the SFA.
-May continue to the popliteal artery with a discontinuous or absent SFA.
-Bilateral in 25%
-Posterior course of the artery renders it subject to repetitive trauma- results in occlusive disease or aneurysm formation.

-Persistence of embryonic sciatic or axial artery as major arterial channel to lower leg
-Clinical issues: pulsatile mass in the buttock with absent common femoral pulse but palpable popliteal pulse, pain/mass in buttock/thigh, ligation/resection of aneursym with femoropopliteal bypass
-Diagnostic checklist: demonstrate continuation of inferior gluteal artery in to thigh and communication with popliteal artery

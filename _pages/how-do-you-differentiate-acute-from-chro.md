title: "How do you differentiate acute from chronic infarcts by MRI?"
---
Both acute and chronic infarcts will show wall motion abnormalities and delayed hyperenhancemment.

Acute: May show edema on T2 sequences.

Chronic: No edema, Myocardial calcium (on CT), fatty metaplasia and aneurysm indicate remote infarct.

Acute transplants are enlarged with edematous medullary pyramids 
Chronic transplants are shrunken and fibrotic with thinned cortex.

Look for blurring at the margins of the ventricles, particularly around the frontal horns, if present indicates transependymal flow of CSF seen in acute obstruction. If there is only ballooning of the ventricles without the blurred margin/halo then it is likely compensated and chronic.

title: "UAE with ectopic pregnancy"
---
Cervical ectopic pregnancy: curettage can lead to intractable bleeding controllable only with hysterectomy.
-Systemic MTX and fetal intracardiac potassium is effective in 80%. Patients who fail these should be referred for embo.
-Angio: ectopic can appear as a focal hypervascular region in the cervix.
-Bilateral UAE prior to curettage helps reduce bleeding and the incidence of emergent hysterectomy.
-Embo with large particles or Gelfoam until stasis is usually adequate.

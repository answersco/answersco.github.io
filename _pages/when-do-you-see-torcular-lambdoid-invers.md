title: "When do you see torcular lambdoid inversion?"
---
In Dandy Walker, the absent vermis leads to the torcula of the venous sinuses above the level of the lambdoid (abnormally high tentorium)

Classic Dandy Walker = Enlarged posterior fossa; cystic dilation of 4th ventricle; and superiorly rotated vermian remnant

Variant DWM: Paritally obstructed 4th ventricle, variable hypoplasia of the vermis; posterior fossa is NOT Enlarged!

title: "What do DCIS, IDC, and ILC Look like on MRI?"
---
DCIS = clumped, ductal, linear or segmental NMLE (kinetics dont help usually)
- &quot;clustered ring&quot; NMLE is buzzword for most PPV for malignancy
 - NMLE can also just be fibrocystic change

IDC = spiculated, irreg shaped mass with hterogeneous enhancement and type 3 curve

ILC = doesn't always show enhancement

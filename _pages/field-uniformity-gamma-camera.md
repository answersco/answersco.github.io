title: "Field uniformity gamma camera"
---
This is making sure that the crystal and the photomultiplier tube are appropriately caliberated which has to be done by a TECHNOLOGIST
2-5% non-uniformity is allowed (1% if SPECT)
So what test do you use:
1. FLOOD test - This sees if the camera can produce a uniform image along the entire crystal surface
A. Extrinsic flood = WITH collimator, DONE DAILY and tests the COLLIMATOR AND CRYSTAL
B. Intrinsic flood = WITHOUT a collimator, DONE WEEKLY 
Recommended counts for both types of flood = 5-10 million

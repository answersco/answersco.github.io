title: "Renal vein sampling"
---
Sampling of renin directly from the renal veins is occasionally helpful to establish the diagnosis of renal vascular HTN and identify which kidney is responsible.
Curved selective catheter (e.g. Cobra-2) or a straight catheter with a tip deflecting wire can be sued.
Single side-hole should be punched near the tip of the catheter
Blood samples are obtained from each renal vein, and from the IVC above and below the renal veins. On the left, the catheter tip should be lateral to the orifice of the left renal vein.

Renin levels from one kidney that are at least 1.5X that of contralateral kidney are indicative of renovascular HTN.
Rise in renin between the infrarenal and suprarenal IVC is further evidence of renovascular HTN.

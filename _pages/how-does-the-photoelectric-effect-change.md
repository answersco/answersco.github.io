title: "How does the photoelectric effect change with increasing photon energy?"
---
The probability of a photoelectric interaction does generally decrease with increasing photon energy EXCEPT at absorption edges. The probability of photoelectric effect (PE) interaction for photons with energies just above the absorption edge is much greater than for photons with energies below the edge.

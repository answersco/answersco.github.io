title: "RNA interference (RNAi)"
---
-blocks gene expression the same way as naturally occurring microRNAs do.
-small synthetic, double-stranded RNAs are introduced into selected cells to block gene expression.
-used to engineer &quot;knock-out&quot; organisms for research
-interferes with translation by antisense mRNA can bind a complementary sequence double-stranded RNA
presence of double-stranded RNA induces RISC

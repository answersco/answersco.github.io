Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: 80-90% of all pancreatic tumors
Pancreatic mass CT: includes unenhanced, late arterial, and PV phases
Late arterial (pancreatic parenchymal phase): has greatest conspicuity for detecting the hypoenhancing mass against the background enhancing pancreas.
Classic appearance: hypodense (CT), T1-hypointense, ill-defined, hypovascular mass causing ductal obstruction and atrophy of the pancreatic tail&#8594; double duct sign of dilated pancreatic duct and CBD
10% are isoattenuating relative to pancreas in pancreatic parenchymal (late arterial) phase and thus very difficult to detect.
Resectable tumor: features no evidence of celiac, SMA, or portal venous invasion. Limited extension to the duodenum, distal stomach, or CBD does not preclude resection (resected in Whipple. Limited venous extension may also be resectable.
Acinar cell carcinoma: rare, aggressive variant in elderly males
Lipase hypersecretion syndrome: SC fat necrosis, bone infarcts, and eosinophilia.

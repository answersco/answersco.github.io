which corresponds better to radiation risk, DLP or CTDI?

DLP = CTDIvol * Scan Length
units are typically in mGy*cm

CTDIvol x scan length

CTDIw (2/3CTDIp +1/3 CTDIc) x pitch = CTDI v
CTDIv x scan length = DLP
indicator to compare protocols from diff scanners uniformly
K unit: mSv/(mGyxcm)

Dose length Product

DLP = volume CTDI X length of scan in (cm)

title: "What is the appropriate mixture for MR arthrogram of the hip?"

Answer: 0.1-0.2 mL gadolinium per 20 mL of iodinated contrast, saline, and/or anesthetic.

Gadolinium thus diluted to 1/100-1/200 concentration. If not dilute enough, it appears as a low signal fluid collection, obscuring the relevant findings.

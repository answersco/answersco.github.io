title: "What do you think of when there are multiple abdominal splanchnic artery saccular aneurysms?"

Segmental arterial mediolysis (SAM) = media of vessels is degraded

* Characterized by &quot;DISSECTING ANEURYSMS&quot; that may affect only portions of the artery where there is deficient media
- involves the mesenteric and renal arteries!

* Classically involves the small to medium-sized arteries of the abdominal viscera (esp. CELIAC ARTERY and branches) but can also involve RP, coronary, and intracranial vessels

- DO NOT angioplasty (increased risk of rupture) = leave it alone!

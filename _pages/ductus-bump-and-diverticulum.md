title: "Ductus bump and diverticulum"
---
Ductus bump: proximal descending thoracic Ao frequently has a slight contour bulge along the inner anterior surface just distal to the left subclavian artery at location of fetal ductus arteriosus.

Ductus diverticulum: rarely, a small outpouching of the ductus remains patient in adults, resulting in an outpouching of the Ao at this point.
-This structure invariably has a broad mouth and totally smooth walls.

title: "Angiographic appearance of RCC, oncocytoma, and AML:"
---
RCC: most are hypervascular.
Often feature AV shunting and venous lakes.
Classic angiographic appearance of bizarre neovascularity.

Oncocytoma: benign renal mass that cannot be reliably distinguished from RCC on cross-sectional imaging
Angiography: spoke-wheel appearance with a peritumoral halo.

AML: hypervascular hamartoma containing macroscopic fat
Angiography: shows tortuous feeding arteries, which have a sunburst appearance on parenchymal phase.
Occasionally small aneurysms are visible, which predispose to hemorrhage, especially if AML is &gt; 4 cm in diameter
Unlike AVF, AML does not feature AV shunting (i.e. no veins are opacified during arterial phase imaging).

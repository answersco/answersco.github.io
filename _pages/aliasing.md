title: "Aliasing"
---
Light blue is very positive vel otherwise blue is neg
Nyquist freq - when doppler shift is higher than this: Ny limit (kHz) = 1/2 PRF

This can also be called wrap around
This occurs when the doppler shift is GREATER than the nyquist frequency = 1/2 X Pulse Repitition Frequency (PRF)

Ways you can reduce aliasing:

1. Decrease doppler shift:
- Use a LOWER frequency probe
- INCREASE the doppler angle (get is closer to 90)

2. INCREASE the PRF 
1. Change your velocity scale
2. Use a higher PRF
3. Use a sample volume that is a LESSER DEPTH (this effectively increases the PRF)

FOV too small (undersampling)
Phase encoding direction
Fix by:
- increasing FOV
- changing phase encoding direction
Fix in 3D by:
- adding slices
- increasing coverage (increasing FOV)

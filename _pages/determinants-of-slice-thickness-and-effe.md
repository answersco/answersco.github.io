Slice thickness&#8594; determines the 3rd dimension of the voxel
Depends on the RF pulse bandwidth and waveform (shape of the RF pulse) applied simultaneously with slice selection gradient.
&#8593; slice thickness by a factor of 2 
&#8594; results in &#8593; voxel volume by a factor of 2.
&#8594; Signal is proportional to voxel volume, which &#8593; by a factor of 2, so SNR is doubled.
&#8594; it also &#8595;spatial resolution

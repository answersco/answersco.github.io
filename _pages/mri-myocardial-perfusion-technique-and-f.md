Adenosine administered to maximally vasodilate the coronary bed to uncover regional differences in blood flow due to a stenosis

Ischemic areas: identified by decreased enhancement during first-pass imaging after IV administration of gadolinium and adenosine.

Rest images are then acquired without adenosine&#8594; if 
perfusion defect persists, it may represent an infarct &#8594; can be confirmed with delayed enhancement images (artifact will not show delayed enhancement)

Primary components of the superficial veins of the leg: the GSV and the SSV
-Both lie within the SC fat of the LE superficial to the fascial layers of the muscles.
-GSV: has origins in the veins along the medial edge of the foot. At the ankle it becomes the GSV, which ascends along the medial aspect of the leg to join the CFV below the inguinal ligament.
-GSV communicates with the deep system along its entire length through small perforating veins. These veins are of great importance in that they drain the saphenous vein into the deep system, where venous return to the heart is assisted by pumplike action of muscular contraction and relaxation around the veins.
-Disruption of the valves in the perforating veins allows blood to drain out of the deep into the superficial system- contributes to varicose veins.

-GSV tributaries:
Anterior and posterior accessory GSVs
Variably from the inferior epigastric and pudendal veins

title: "Angio and tx in thoracic outlet syndrome"
---
Goals of angio: 
-Evaluate for subclavian artery stenosis, aneurysmal change, presence of thrombus, and detection of distal emboli.

Injections should be performed with arm in neutral position and in the position that elicits symptoms.
-Evocative maneuvers can induce arterial compression in 50% of normal patients.
-In positive cases, both subclavian arteries should be studied.

Definitive treatment requires surgical decompression, resection of the aneurysm, and placement of bypass graft
-Patients who present with distal emboli may first undergo thrombolysis
-Exclusion of aneurysm with stent-graft can be performed after surgical decompression

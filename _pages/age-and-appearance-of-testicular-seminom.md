title: "Age and appearance of testicular seminoma"
---
Most common testicular tumor, best prognosis, age ~25, whites &gt; blacks

US: homogeneous hypoechoic round mass, classically replacing the entire testicle
MRI: usually homogeneously T2-dark (non-seminomatous GCT usually higher signal, larger calcifications, more heterogeneous, and younger)

In general, Doppler only helpful in testicular masses if flow is absent (can suggest hematoma)

Hemobilia: occurs frequently, but is almost always transient, settling over 2-3 days.
-Backbleeding can occur if catheter side-hole is left in the hepatic parenchyma and communicates with a hepatic vein. Can be repositioned.
-FFP may need to be given after procedure due to short half-life.
-Hemobilia presenting after several days of drainage is usually more serious, and may be due to pseudoaneurysm or tumor bleeding. Replacing the catheter with a larger catheter often tamponades bleeding from a PsA, but embo may be needed.

Bacteremia
-Continue Abx for 2 days after drainage.
-For patients who are septicemic before the procedure, it is best to perform the procedure with the minimum intervention necessary. 
-The biliary tree shouldn't be overdistended with contrast. It may be appropriate to simply place an external drain rather than internal/external.

Bile leak and peritonitis:
-Important during drainage that dilators and catheters not be removed until the next dilator or catheter is ready to be placed. If the track has been dilated and only the guidewire is present in the track, bile can flow out along the guidewire into the peritoneal cavity.
-Using a 9-Fr sheath helps protect peritoneal cavity from bile leaks.
-Embo of the track with Gelfoam or glue helps prevent bile leakage and bleeding.

Late complications of stents include occlusion and tumor ingrowth. Migration is rare with metallic stents.

title: "Clinical presentation and physical exam in critical limb ischemia (CLI)"
---
Manifests as rest pain, ulceration, and tissue necrosis.
Rest pain in CLI is aggravated by elevation of the limb, and relieved when limb is dependent.
Foot may be noticeably red when dependent, and pale when elevated
Ulceration: painful, and usually occurs in the foot and toes following minor trauma
-Spontaneous posterolateral lower leg ulceration can be seen with small vessel arterial disease

Severe ischemic changes can develop in diabetic patients in the presence of palpable pedal pulses, owing to extensive microvascular pathology

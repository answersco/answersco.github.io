title: "Pathogenesis of syphilis"
---
1) Primary - initial infection, results in open painless lesion on genitals (hard chancre); can get larger as the bacteria multiples and grows
2) Secondary - spirochetes have spread to many locations in body; rash develops
3) Latency - dormant up to 20 years
4) Tertiary - where disease can become fatal - neurosyphilis - lead to dementia or problems in processing or thinking, damage to heart and aorta, large lesions more like internal large chancres throughout various organs such as large arteries called gummas so death from organ failure happens
-Some would end up in mental institutions during this stage from the neurosyphilis before it was known what syphilis was

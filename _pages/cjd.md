&quot;pulvinar&quot; (post thalamus), cortical and striatal defects, DWI restricted along cortex and T2 bright Basal Ganglia

Findings:

- CORTICALLY based restricted diffusion (image)
- Hockey stick sign (involvement of the pulvinar or dorsal medial thalamus)
- Series of CT or MRI showing rapid brain atrophy

1) diffusion-restricted cortical ribboning
2) pulvinar sign = hockey stick of dorsomedial thalamus
3) series of MR or CT showing rapid atrophy

1) diffusion-restricted cortical ribboning
2) pulvinar sign = FLAIR hockey stick of dorsomedial thalamus

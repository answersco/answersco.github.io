title: "What is pulse mode, current mode and dose mode in radiation detectors? Give examples of each"
---
Pulse mode: Photon counting (well-counter and scintillation camera)
Current mode: Charge integrating (Current out is equal to energy deposited)
Absorbed dose mode: collects and stores dose for extended period of time (dosimeter)

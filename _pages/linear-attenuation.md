title: "Linear Attenuation"
---
The fraction of photons interacting per unit thickness of an absorber,i.e., the fraction of photons removed from the xray at a certain distance
Factors in compton scatter, photoelectric effects, and coherent scatter
Example: linear attenuation between water, ICE, and vapor (all h20) is DIFFERENT as the density of these is different (remember absorption is related to DENSITY) 

See image below

Mass attenuation: Don't really understand this but basically know that the MASS attenuation between water, ice, and vapor is the same

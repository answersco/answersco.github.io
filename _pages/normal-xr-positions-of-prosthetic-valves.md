Prosthetic valves:
Lateral XR: the aortic valve is centered on the plane of a line drawn from the sternal/diaphragmatic junction and the carina
The tricuspid valve is to the right and anterior to the mitral valve, and inferior and medial to the aortic valve.
The pulmonic valve is the most superior and leftward valve.
The atrioventricular valves (mitral and tricuspid) are open in diastole.

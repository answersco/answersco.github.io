title: "What affects slice thickness in helical MDCT?"
---
The slice thickness in helical multidetector CT is affected by a variety of parameters. Increasing pitch, using 360&#176; instead of 180&#176; reconstruction, and detector binning will increase the slice sensitivity profile (slice thickness). Some scanners use z-filtering to keep the slice thickness constant even with change in the above-mentioned parameters. The number of data acquisition system (DAS) channels does not affect the slice thickness, rather how many &quot;slices&quot; can be acquired at the same time.

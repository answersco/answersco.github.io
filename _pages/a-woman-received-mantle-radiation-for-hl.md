title: "A woman received mantle radiation for HL at 21 years of age. According to ACR, when should she begin screening MM?"
---
Answer: 29 years
Mammographic screening should begin 8 years after XRT but not before age 25 for women who received mantle radiation between the ages of 10 and 30. 
Because there is a particularly high risk of cancer after mantle radiation, the American Cancer Society recommends screening with MRI.

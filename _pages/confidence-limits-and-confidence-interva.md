Confidence limits: 
A confidence interval (CI) is a range of reasonable values that are intended to contain the parameter of interest (e.g. the mean) with a certain degree of confidence.
CI is used to estimate population values without having data from all members of the population. 
CI provides information about how precise the estimate is: wider CI indicates less precision.
CI quantifies the precision of the estimate&#8594; the desired degree of confidence is most often chosen at 95%.
Calculated using the SD (or with unknown SD in a large, normally distributed population)
If population SD is not known and the sample is small, the Student's t distribution is used instead of SD.
CIs may be calculated for point estimates (e.g. odds ratios) or proportions (e.g. sensitivity and specificity)

Whereas p values indicate a statistically significant result, CIs provide a range of values in the units of the variable of interest, to help the reader interpret implications of the results at either end of the range.

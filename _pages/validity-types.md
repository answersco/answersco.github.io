---
1. face validity: simularities between the simulator and real life

2. construct validity: defferentiating different skills

3. content validity: ability to teach

4. concurrent validity: correlation of the simulation with other measures of assessment

5. discriminant validity: distinction of the results from other assesments

6. predictive validity: correlation with simulation performance and real life performance

title: "Neolithic Revolution"
---
The switch from nomadic lifestyles to a settled agricultural lifestyle is this revolution.

This social revolution was also known as the New Stone Age where people changed from hunting and gathering food to domesticating animals and cultivating land as farmers.

This revolution took place around 8000 B.C.E., when human beings in some places discovered agriculture and began to settle in permanent communities. The switch from hunting-foraging to agriculture created a more reliable source of food, which in turn fostered population growth and more complex economic and social systems. The Neolithic Revolution is also called the &quot;Agricultural revolution&quot; and &quot;Agrarian revolution.&quot;

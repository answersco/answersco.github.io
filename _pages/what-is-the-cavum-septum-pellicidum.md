title: "What is the cavum septum pellicidum?"
---
The cavum septum pellucidum is a normal CSF filled structure seen between the two layers of the septum pellucidum which forms when the decussating fibers of the corpus callosum degenerate. This structure usually disappears before the second year of life. Posterior to and continuous with this is cavum vergae under the splenium of the corpus callosum. Posterior to the cavum vergae is the cavum velum interpositum.

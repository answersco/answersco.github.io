title: "Stem cells"
---
-stem cells reveals how genes are turned on and off
-if transcription factor pdx-1 is activated, some progenitor cells follow the endocrine pathway
-other progenitor cells respond to other signals and yield daughter cells that follow the exocrine pathway (called acinar cells)

-renew tissues
-divides by mitosis
-produces 2 daughter cells: one remains a stem cell and replaces the parent &amp; the other cell becomes more specialized, differentiates into a (committed) progenitor cell
-all cells in the human body descend from stem cells by mitosis and differentiation
-cells differentiate down cell lineages by differential gene expression
-present throughout life and provide growth and repair

can both replicate themselves and give rise to differentiated cells

-undifferentiated
-sit in stratum basale only
-can divide and have option to become mature keratinocytes

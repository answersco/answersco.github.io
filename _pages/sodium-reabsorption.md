title: "Sodium reabsorption"
---
-creates an osmotic and electrical gradient that drives the reabsorption of water and other solutes
-Na+ is most abundant cation in filtrate 
-creates steep concentration gradient that favors its diffusion into epithelial cells
-sodium is prevented from accumulating in epithelial cells by Na+/K+ pumps in the basal surface of the epithelium
-negative chloride ions follow the positive sodium ions by electrical attraction
-various antiports in the apical cell membrane that absorb Cl&#8722; in exchange for other anions they eject into the tubular fluid: K+/Cl&#8722; symport

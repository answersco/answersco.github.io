title: "What type of coil can improve quality of cardiac MRI?"
---
Helpful to use a dedicated cardiac multi-element phased array RF coil as opposed to a body coil (transmit-receive coil built into bore of most scanners)
These improve image quality and spatial resolution
Also allow for parallel imaging &#8594; decreases imaging time

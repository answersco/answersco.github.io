---
Subclavian artery: major branches include vertebral, internal mammary, thyrocervical trunk, costocervical trunk, and dorsal scapular

Becomes the axillary artery at the 1st rib.
Axillary artery becomes the brachial artery at the lower border of the TERES MAJOR

Brachial artery bifurcates into ulnar and radial arteries around the radial head.
Ulnar usually bigger, and usually gives off the common interosseous artery
Ulnar supplies the superficial palmar arch (usually)
Radial usually supplies the deep arch.
High origin of the radial artery: comes off either the axillary or high brachial artery (normally around radial head).

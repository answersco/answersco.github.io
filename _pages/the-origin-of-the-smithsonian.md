title: "The origin of the Smithsonian"
---
The Smithsonian Institution opened in Washington, D.C., in 1855. It is the world's largest museum and covers 19 acres. It was founded because of the generosity of an Englishman named James Smithson. When Smithson died in 1829, he left his money to his nephew. If the nephew had no heirs, the money was to go to the U.S. government to start a museum. The nephew died in 1835, leaving no children behind. Then, sure enough 105 bags of gold arrived in the United States for the museum.

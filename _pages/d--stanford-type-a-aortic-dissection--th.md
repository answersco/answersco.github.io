title: "D. Stanford Type A Aortic Dissection. This image shows a dilation of the ascending aorta with a normal caliber descending aorta. An intimal flap can clearly be seen in the ascending aorta (arrow) representing an aortic dissection. There is no wall thicken to suggest an intramural hematoma. This aortic dissection is Stanford Type A since it includes the ascending aorta; Type B would include only the descending aorta."

Greek philosopher. A pupil of Plato, the tutor of Alexander the Great, and the author of works on logic, metaphysics, ethics, natural sciences, politics, and poetics, he profoundly influenced Western thought. In his philosophical system, which led him to criticize what he saw as Plato's metaphysical excesses, theory follows empirical observation and logic, based on the syllogism, is the essential method of rational inquiry.

Unlike his teacher Plato, he believe that philosophers could rely on their senses to provide accurate information about the world.

One of the greatest of the ancient Athenian philosophers. Pupil of Plato and tutor to Alexander the Great.

A Greek polymath philosopher (384-322 B.C.E.); student of Plato and teacher of Alexander the Great.

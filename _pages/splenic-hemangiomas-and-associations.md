Splenic hemangioma: most common benign splenic neoplasm, and may be solitary or multiple, usually small
Associated with Kasabach-Merritt syndrome (anemia, thrombocytopenia, and consumptive coagulopathy) and Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome (cutaneous hemangiomas, varicose veins, and extremity hypertrophy) &#8594; both of these visceral hemangiomatosis syndromes are usually associated with phleboliths.
CT: typically iso- or hypoattenuating pre-contrast, and hyperenhancing
MR: typically T2-hyperintense, and may enhance peripherally or homogeneously
The classic pattern of nodular enhancement of hepatic hemangioma is uncommon in the spleen
NM: Tc-99m RBCs show &#8593; activity within the lesion on delayed images, while Tc-99m sulfur colloid may show either &#8593; or &#8595; activity.

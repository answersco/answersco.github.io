title: "Describe six types of validity in simulation-based training"
---
face validity - how well simulated objects resemble real life objects

construct validity - how well the simulator can determine the level of expertise on a specific subject

content validity - how well simulator teaches or assessed desired knowledge

concurrent validity - how well simulation correlates with other performance tests

discriminant validity - whether this simulation can test important aspects of performance better than other tests

predictive validity - how well performance in the simulation predicts real life performance.

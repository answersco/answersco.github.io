Non-lymphomatous adenopathy: 
Lymph-node calcification, low-attenuation ,and avid enhancement are unusual features for lymphoma, and should suggest an alternative diagnosis
Eggshell calcification of LN: often present in silicosis and CWP, less commonly in sarcoidosis
Dense calcification within LN: sarcoidosis or OGD
Low-attenuation LN: nonspecific, but should raise concern for active TB
Also seen in fungal infection, lymphoma, and metastatic disease
Avid LN enhancement: Castleman disease, sarcoidosis, TB, and vascular metastases (including RCC, thyroid carcinoma, lung carcinoma, sarcoma, and melanoma)

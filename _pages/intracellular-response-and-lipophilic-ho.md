title: "Intracellular response and lipophilic hormones"
---
-steroid hormones and TH use this mechanism
-gene expression is increases
EX. estrogen primes cells to manufacture and express the progesterone receptor OR T3 promotes expression of NA/K pump

1) Hormones cross plasma membrane and bind to cytoplasmic receptors
2) Hormone binding alters receptor conformation so it no longer binds inhibitor
3) Hormone-receptor complex translocates to nucleus
4) Hormone-receptor complex binds to DNA which usually turns on transcription, but can also turn it off
5) Cellular response is a change in gene expression

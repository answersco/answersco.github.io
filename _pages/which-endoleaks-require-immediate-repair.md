title: "Which endoleaks require immediate repair?"

Answer: Types I and III&#8594; high-pressure leaks due to direct communication between the systemic blood flow and the aneurysm site.
Type I: leaks at the proximal or distal attachment site. May respond to angioplasty; otherwise requires balloon-expandable stent over attachment site.
Type III: caused by defect within the graft material or by structural failures resulting in a gap between the component parts. Requires placement of a new stent-graft component across the site of graft defect or junctional separation.

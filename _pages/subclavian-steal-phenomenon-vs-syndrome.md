title: "Subclavian steal phenomenon vs syndrome, and causes:"
---
SS syndrome and phenomenon are both due to stenosis and/or occlusion of the proximal subclavian artery proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery.

SS syndrome: retrograde flow in the ipsilateral vertebral artery (also in phenomenon) AND associated cerebral ischemia.

Symptoms: tend to occur when the upper limb is exercised, and depend on the integrity of collateral intracranial flow (PCOMS).

98% due to atherosclerosis.
Other causes: Takayasu arteritis, XRT, preductal aortic coarctation, and Blalock-Taussig Shunt.

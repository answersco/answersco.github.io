---
Internal: impingement of rotator cuff on undersurface (deep surface) along the glenoid labrum and humeral head

Posterior superior: overhead movements (throwers, tennis, swimming) &#8594; posterior-superior cuff (junction of supra- and infraspinatus tendons) comes into contact with posterior-superior glenoid &#8594; pinched between labrum and greater tuberosity

Anterior-Superior: undersurface of biceps and subscapularis may impinge against the anterior-superior glenoid rim

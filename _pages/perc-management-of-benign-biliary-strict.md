-Balloon dilatation of biliary strictures is most often performed in patients with anastomotic strictures such as choledochojejunal or hepaticojejunal anastomoses.
-Patients with iatrogenic strictures of bile ducts are also suitable candidates (limited data shows better results for surgery in these patients)
-Patients with PSC may benefit from dilatation as long as there is a dominant stricture. Lower success rate, but balloon dilatation may be the only available treatment, particularly for intrahepatic ductal strictures.
-Biliary strictures from pancreatitis or biliary calculi can be dilatated, but these are usually done via ERCP.

---
Tube current: significantly less than radiography (smaller focal spots used)
further reduction in mA for magnification (small focal spot)
Kilovoltage: significantly less than radiography.
improves subject contrast.
Source to image distance (SID): significantly less than radiography.
compensates for low beam intensity due to smaller focal spot size.

For evaluation of renal arteries, the image intensifier should be positioned in slight LAO projection to best show the renal artery origins.
Sufficient contrast injection (15-25 mL/sec for 2 seconds) and rapid filming (3-6 frames/sec) are necessary.
Right renal artery can arise in very anterior position- steep LAO or even lateral may be necessary to visualize this ostium.

During selective catheterization, when multiple renal arteries are present, the renal parenchyma in the watershed areas between arteries typically has an irregular, indistinct contour on angio.

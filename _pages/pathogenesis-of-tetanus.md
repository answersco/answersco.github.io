title: "Pathogenesis of tetanus"
---
-C. tetani 
-wound infection such as a puncture wound from a nail and toxicosis (any disease caused by a toxin)

Pathogenesis:
-spores located at ends of bacteria and invade deep puncture wounds
-vegetative cells develop a produce potent toxin very quickly: tetanospasmin - a neurotoxin
-toxin travels to spinal cord and no other cells or tissues 
-binds to inhibitory motor neurons and slows down the impulses to your muscle
-powerful, over-contractions of skeletal muscles happen
-disease progresses by whatever muscles get affected first - used to be called locked-jaw bc it affected facial muscles first - then the arms next which curl in and flex then back arches and muscles of breathing get affect lastly and where it becomes fatal

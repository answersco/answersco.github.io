Mistakes: reflect failures during attentional behaviors (those that require conscious thought, analysis, and planning, as in active problem-solving)
Rather than lapses in concentration (as with slips), mistakes typically involve insufficient knowledge, failure to correctly interpret available information, or application of the wrong cognitive heuristic or rule.

For Julia's birthday party, her parents bought a pi&#241;ata for $15 and filled it with all of her favorite candies. They bought 4 bags of peanut butter candies for $6 per bag, 3 bags of lollipops for $8 per bag, and 5 bags of sour candies for $6 per bag. How much did the pi&#241;ata and the candy cost all together?

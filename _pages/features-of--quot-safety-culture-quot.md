Safety Culture
HROs maintain a commitment to safety at all levels. 
This commitment establishes a &quot;culture of safety&quot; that encompasses several key features:
Acknowledgment of the high-risk nature of an organization's activities and the determination to achieve consistently safe operations
Blame-free environment where individuals are able to report errors or near misses without fear of reprimand
Encouragement of collaboration across ranks and disciplines to seek solutions to patient safety problems
Organizational commitment of resources to address safety concerns.

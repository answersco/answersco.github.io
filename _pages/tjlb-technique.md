-Jugular or RHV access obtained
-Hepatic venogram performed to confirm identity and patency of vein
-Catheter advanced into selected portal vein- optimal location for biopsy from the HV is within 3-4 cm of the IVC (more peripheral risks capsular perforation).
-Tip of the cannula is rotated such that the needle will be directed in an anterior and caudal direction. 
-Biopsy needle advanced a few mm into hepatic parenchyma, and device is deployed.

For post-transplant patients, it is key to know the post-operative vascular anatomy.

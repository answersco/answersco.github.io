title: "What is the mechanism, stability of compression fracture of thoracolumbar spine?"
---
-often from HYPERFLEXION OR AXIAL load
-can be atraumatic (osteoporosis or metastases)-elderly with fall and back pain = collapsed vertebrae

-stability: usually stable - can have ethem chronically

-LOSS OF HEIGHT IS CALCULATED: &gt;50% or multiple fractures are unstable (divide anterior over posterior to see height of loss)

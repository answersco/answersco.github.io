title: "Williams"
---
case that assigns culpability to a couple who didn't perceive the risk, charging them w/ negligent homicide; knew their son was ill but feared gov't repercussions; manslaughter liability using ORDINARY negligence standard (could argue this wasn't a GROSS deviation b/c it happened within a four-day period&#8212;important to see both sides ordinary vs. criminal negligence standards)

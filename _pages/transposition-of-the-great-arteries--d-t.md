title: "Transposition of the Great Arteries: D-Txp and L-Txp"
---
In all types of transposition of the great arteries, the aorta is connected to the morphologic right ventricle (this is the hallmark of transposition of the great arteries).
In D-transposition of the great arteries, the right atrium maintains its normal connection to the morphologic right ventricle.
In L-transposition of the great arteries (also called &quot;corrected transposition&quot;), there is ventricular inversion, and the right atrium is connected to the morphologic left ventricle.

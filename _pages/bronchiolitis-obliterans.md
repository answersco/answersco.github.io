title: "Bronchiolitis obliterans"
---
aka Swyer - James syndrome - unilateral air trapping due to obstruction of distal bronchioles

Chronic rejection of lung transplant obliterates small bronchioles (inflammation and fibrosis)
- If you see AIR TRAPPING on expiration at or after 6 months = CHRONIC REJECTION

Findings: bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening, air trapping, and interlobular septal thickening

Basically remember that this is oging to OBLITERATE the bronchi WITHOUT mucoid impaction
You can see bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickeing
You can see MOSAIC attenuation 
This can be seen in the post transplant setting

Bronchial wall thickening, air trapping, interlobular septal thickening

an inflammatory process that allows connective tissue plugs. The luminal inflammation triggers white blood cell clumping with fibroblast (connective cell) growth that occludes and eventually obliterates these airways and leads to restricted lung volume with decreased vital capacity.

submucosal peribronchial fibrosis

No intraluminal granulation tissue or polyps/polyposis

title: "Clinical presentation of pelvic congestion syndrome"
---
Most often, but not exclusively in women of child-bearing age.
50% of patients with imaging findings of PCS are asymptomatic.
Symptoms include pelvic pain, dyspareunia, menstrual abnormalities, vulvar varices, and LE varicose veins. Symptoms are worse with standing, toward the end of the day, with sexual arousal, and during menstruation.

Reflux of blood in ovarian veins is the dominant underlying etiology. 
Predisposing conditions include prior pregnancy, nutcracker syndrome, tubal ligation, and presence of IUD.

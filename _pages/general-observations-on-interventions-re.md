title: "General observations on interventions regarding outcome"
---
-Interventions on short stenoses have best outcome, with results deteriorating as lesions become longer and include occlusions.

-Surgical bypass with good quality single-segment saphenous vein has best long-term primary and secondary patency, but is associated with longer recovery and more morbidity than perc interventions.

-Bare-metal stents and stent-grafts improve long-term patency, but restenosis remains a major issue.
-Drug-eluting stents and drug-coated balloons show promise in reducing incidence of restenosis by as much as 50%, but lack long-term data.

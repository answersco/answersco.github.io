title: "What is lissencephaly?"
---
Lissencephaly meaning literally &quot;smooth brain&quot; is characterized by a complete loss of the normal sulcal/gyral. Agyria is roughly synonymous with lissencephaly whereas pachygyria refers to areas of brain with shallow sulci and a decreased number of broad flat gyri. Incomplete lissencephaly is often used synonymously with agyria/pachygyria complex.

title: "1. Thickness of the detector  2. Linear attenuation coefficient of the detector material which depends on :  3. Density: increased density = increased efficiency)  4. Atomic number :( increased atomic number = increased efficiency)  5. Gamma ray photon energy: increased energy means decreased intrinsic efficiency."

What factors determine the intrinsic detector efficiency of a detector?

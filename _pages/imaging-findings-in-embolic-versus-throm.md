title: "Imaging findings in embolic versus thrombotic acute arterial occlusion"
---
Embolic: 
-Normal vessels with abrupt occlusion (sometimes multiple), frequently at major bifurcation of vessel
-No collaterals
-Meniscus sign
-Frequently profound ischemia

Thrombotic:
-DIffuse athero, well-developed collaterals
-Usually mid-vessel occlusion
-Limb frequently threatened but viable

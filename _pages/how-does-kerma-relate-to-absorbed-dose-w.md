title: "How does KERMA relate to absorbed dose when accounting for photons of different energies (kVp)? - low energy photon - high energy photon"
---
Low energy Photon:
- KERMA = absorbed dose 
(because photoelectric effect dominates)

High energy photon:
- KERMA &gt; absorbed dose
(some photons shoot right through)

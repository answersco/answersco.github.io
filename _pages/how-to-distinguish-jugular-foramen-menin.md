title: "How to distinguish jugular foramen meningioma from schwannoma from Glomus jugulare?"
---
Glomus jugulare = permeative bony destruction with salt and pepper hyperenehancing mass

Meningioma = When centered near the jugular foramen, meningioma shows a hyperostotic or mixed permeative-sclerotic response, unlike the purely permeative changes in glomus Jugulare

Schwannoma = from the 9th, 10th, or 11th cranial nerves would result in smoothly expanded margins of the jugular foramen, rather than the surrounding permeative-destructive changes
- discrete fusiform uniformly enhancing tumor, rather than the irregular hypervascular mass

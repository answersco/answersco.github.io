title: "Aortitis:"

Aortitis: may be inflammatory or infectious, and can lead to mycotic aneurysm.
Inflammatory aortitis: can be due to Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis, ankylosing spondylitis, polyarteritis nodosa, rheumatoid arthritis, and immune complex disease. These are treated with corticosteroids.
Acute phase: shows circumferential mural thickening and enhancement.
May be associated aneurysm, dissection, or IMH.
In contrast to IMH, aortitis tends to cause circumferential thickening, rather than the eccentric, crescentic thickening seen in IMH.
MRI findings in active aortitis: aortic wall thickness &gt; 2 mm and enhancement of the aortic wall.
Chronic phase: may show long segmental stenoses and/or aneurysms.

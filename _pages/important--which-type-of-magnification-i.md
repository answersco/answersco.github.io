title: "IMPORTANT: Which type of magnification increases patient dose (electronic or geometric)?"
---
BOTH!

(electronic mag increases patient dose TO A LESSER EXTENT than geometric mag)

- electronic mag (zoom in fluoro) increases dose because you decrease the input FOV so less input phosphor is irradiated and AEC ramps up the juice (1.4-2.0x per setting increase)

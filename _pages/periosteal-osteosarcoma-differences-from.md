Periosteal is in the DIAPHYSIS, medially (not posteriorly)

At MR imaging, periosteal chondromas are T2 hyperintense, whereas parosteal osteosarcoma is typically hypointense on T1- and T2-
weighted images due to dense ossification.

Unlike parosteal osteosarcoma, periosteal
osteosarcoma is usually more lytic in appearance, causes cortical erosion and periosteal reaction.

Intermediate (not LOW) grade

Younger patients (age 15-25)

For normal distribution of continuous variables, looking for differences in mean.
Comparing means from 2 independent populations &#8594; t test
Comparing means from paired samples (e.g. same subject tested at 2 different times) &#8594; paired t test
Comparing more than 2 means from 2 or more independent groups &#8594; ANOVA

Comparing means from 2 independent populations &#8594; Mann-Whitney-U test.
Comparing means from paired samples &#8594; Wilcoxon Signed Rank test
Comparing paired data when symmetric distribution of the variable around the median is not assumed &#8594; Sign test

Comparing observed frequencies with expected frequencies, often in 2 x 2 table (especially for test homogeneity between 2 groups or independence of 2 variables in one group) &#8594; x2 test
Comparing observed frequencies with expected frequencies when the sample size is small (&lt;30) or # of observations in any one cell in the 2x2 table is &lt; 5 &#8594; Fisher Exact test
Comparing paired count data (e.g. 2 measurements form the same subject) &#8594; McNemar test

title: "Portal vein: normal diameter and bifurcation"
---
Normal portal vein: 8 cm in length, 10-12 mm diameter
At portal hepatis, the MPV bifurcates into right and left branches. 
The MPV bifurcation is extrahepatic in 40-48%.
Trifurcation resulting in absence of a right portal trunk seen in 11%.
LPV provides a branch to a portion of the right lobe (usually segments 5 and 8) in 4%.

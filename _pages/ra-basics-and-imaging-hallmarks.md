Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) &#8594; clinically presents with symmetrical joint pain, swelling, and morning stiffness.
RA first affects the small joints in the hand and wrists. Foot involvement may also occur early. In more advanced cases, RA affects the cervical spine, knees, shoulders, and hips.

Radiographic hallmarks of RA include:
Marginal erosions&#8594; occur first at the intracapsular articular margins in the &quot;bare area,&quot; which is a region of exposed bone just within the joint capsule, not covered by thick cartilage.
Soft-tissue swelling.
Diffuse, symmetric joint space narrowing.
Periarticular osteopenia.
Joint subluxations.

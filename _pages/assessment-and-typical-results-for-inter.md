title: "Assessment and typical results for intervention in renal artery stenosis"

In HTN, improvement is proportional to baseline systolic pressure. Performance goal of 10-15 mmHg reduction for pretreatment systolic pressures of 155-180, or target of 165 for pressures greater than 180 mmHg sugested for renal artery stents.
-Reduction in # of MP meds, stabilization or improvement of renal function, and low RI may also suggest good clinical result.

In patients with HTN, renal artery stent placement for AS lesions has high technical success rate, but HTN is rarely cured.
Angioplasty and stent placement for renal insufficiency has similar technical success rate, but lower overall success rates.

Intimal hyperplasia resulting in restenosis is a major limitation of all renal artery interventions.

-Normal changes of aging are benign (wrinkles, grey hair, etc - does not affect you physically) and changes leading to disease (menopause can put women at risk for stroke or osteoporosis due to less estrogen) 

-Changes leading to disease can cause acute illness (pneumonia, UTIs) and chronic illness (diabetes, etc.) which both acute and chronic illness impact each other

-Chronic illness can lead to decrease in function which if goes long enough untreated can cause disability but rehab can help chronic illness, decease in function, and disability

title: "A patient has elevated blood pressure in her upper extremities and a chest radiograph shows rib notching. Which congenital heart disease does this patient likely have? A) Atrial septal defect B) Ebstein's anomaly C) Total anomalous pulmonary venous return D) Coarctation of the Aorta E) Tetralogy of Fallot"

D. Coarctation of the Aorta. Patients with this condition have increased blood pressure in their upper extremities and decreased blood pressure distal to the coarctation. Enlarged collateral pathways through the intercostal arteries are responsible for the rib notching seen on the chest radiograph.

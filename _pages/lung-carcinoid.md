title: "Lung carcinoid"
---
Typical carcinoids: slow-growing, locally invasive, no association with smoking.
Appear centrally within a bronchus (only 1% in trachea) - can cause obstructive symptoms or hemoptysis
Octreotide-+
Can cause carcinoid syndrome
Left-sided (mitral and aortic) valvular degradation (versus GI carcinoid, which involves right sided valves)

Atypical: rare, older patients, presenting as mass.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma: not associated with smoking
Usually main or lobar bronchus
Much more common in trachea than carcinoid.

- two types:

1. Peripheral pumonary
2. Bronchia
&#8212; The bronchial subtype can cause obstructive symptoms and hemoptysis. Also can cause a bronchocele

NOTE: If you get valvular degenaration, this will typically be LEFT side as opposed to RIGHT side (which happens with GI carcinoids)

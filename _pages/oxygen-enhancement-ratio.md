OER: relative effectiveness of radiation to produce damage at different oxygen levels
-Idea is that tissue is more sensitive to radiation in an oxygenated state.
-OER ONLY REALLY MATTERS WITH LOW LET RADIATION
-With high LET radiation, the OER is often 1 (biologic damage without oxygen = damage with oxygen).

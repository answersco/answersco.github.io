title: "CT matrix size, pixels, voxels  What is the matrix size for CT?  How many shades of gray in each pixel?  Formula for pixel size?  Pixel vs Voxel"
---
Matrix size for CT: 512 x 512

Each pixel represents 4096 possible shades of gray (12 bits, 212 = 4096)

Pixel size = FOV / matrix

Pixel w x h = voxel w x h

Voxel has a 3D (depth) component that represents the slice thickness

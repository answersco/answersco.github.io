title: "Intrapancreatic Spleen"
---
Sulfur colloid or Tc99m damaged RBC

Look for the question stem to say something about POST trauma or the SCAN to show no normal spleen
These are going to follow spleen on all phases (T1 dark, T2 bright, tiger stripe arterial phase, WILL restrict diffusion like the spleen)
You can confirm with nuclear medicine via Heat treated RBC OR sulfur colloid

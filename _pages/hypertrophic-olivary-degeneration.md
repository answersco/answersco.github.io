title: "Hypertrophic olivary degeneration"
---
lesion that damages the neuronal connections between the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum, the red nucleus, and the inferior olivary nucleus: the dentatorubral-olivary pathway (1,2). It is considered a unique type of degeneration because it is associated with enlargement, rather than atrophy, of the affected structure&#8212;the inferior olivary neurons 

anatomic connections related to palatal myoclonus, which is a common clinical association, and this pathway is thus referred to as the &quot;Guillain-Mollaret triangle.&quot;

Considering the differential diagnosis of the medullary lesion, high intensity in the anterolateral part of the medulla is not a specific imaging finding. It may be seen with a wide variety of pathologic processes, including infarction; demyelination related to multiple sclerosis; tumor (eg, astrocytoma, metastasis, and lymphoma); and infectious and other inflammatory processes such as tuberculosis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, sarcoidosis, and rhombencephalitis. However, if the lesion is strictly limited to one or both inferior olivary nuclei, with sparing of the surrounding medullary tissues, and particularly if there is associated focal olivary enlargement, hypertrophic olivary degeneration should be strongly suggested

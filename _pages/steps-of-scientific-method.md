1) Make an observation and/or perceive a question
EX. Is alcohol a trigger food/drink for eczema?
2) Form a hypothesis, specific predictions
EX. abstaining from alcohol = no eczema
introducing alcohol = eczema comes back
3) Test the hypothesis, collect data
EX. elimination diet (all foods and slowly bring some back or one food at a time)
4) Draw conclusions, look at data
5) Report results 
EX. eczema has other factors/limitations you cannot call from (seasons, temperature)
6) Evaluation, need to change hypothesis
EX. alcohol is not it so choose another drink/food
-science is replicable: same experiment, diff. results so people can correct or build off it

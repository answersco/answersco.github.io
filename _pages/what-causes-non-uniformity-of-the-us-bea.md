title: "What causes non-uniformity of the US beam?"
---
Beam intensity (power, measured in watts) is not uniform

Beam spread: intensity will decrease from the center to the edges
Maximum sound pressure is always found along the acoustic axis (center-point)

Divergence of the beam in the far-field causes the power to be spread over a large area

Interference occurs from numerous point sources interacting in the near field (less with broadband transducer)

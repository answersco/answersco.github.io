title: "Troubleshooting: failure to enter bile duct, and coagulopathy"
---
Procedure is best terminated after 15-20 failed passes with the needle.
-Alternatively, one can place a needle into the GB and inject contrast through the GB to outline the biliary system.
-This is only possible if the biliary obstruction is below the junction of the cystic duct and CHD.

If blood coagulation parameters are abnormal, the perc tract can be embolized with Gelfoam or autologous blood clot as the needle is withdrawn.

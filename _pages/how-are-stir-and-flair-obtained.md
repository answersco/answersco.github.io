title: "How are STIR and FLAIR obtained?"

Inversion recovery: instead of initial 90 pulse, you start with a 180 degree preparation pulse. You then wait for relaxation of the thing you want to saturate to hit its null point, then hit it with 90 degree pulse, giving that tissue no signal.
TI = time between the 180 and 90 pulses.
STIR: uses short T1 (120-160 ms) to suppress fat
FLAIR: uses long TI to suppress water (around 2000 ms)

Relative to other fat-sat techniques, STIR is much less susceptible to magnetic susceptibility and field inhomogeneity.
STIR cannot be used with Gad. Gd enhanced tissues have similar TI to that of fat, and may get nulled out.

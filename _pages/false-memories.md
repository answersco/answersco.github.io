title: "False memories"
---
-Inaccuracies and distortions of our reconstructed memories that occur over time.
-When we retrieve a memory, it is susceptible to &quot;contamination&quot; by newly presented stimuli and information. 
EX. When we see a car accident and saw the blue car break and the red car hit. But later when the sheriff was asking you how fast the blue car was going when it hit the red car you start thinking about the speed and not the color and your mind switches what you originally knew

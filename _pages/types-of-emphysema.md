Centrilobular emphysema: smoking-related
Predominantly affects upper lobes
Like RB-ILD (also smoking-related), it primarily affects the center of the secondary pulmonary lobule.
All smoking related lung disease (RB, RB-ILD, DIP, PLCH, and emphysema) may be within the same spectrum of disease caused by macrophage-mediated inflammation in reaction to inhaled particles and toxins.

Paraseptal&#8594; usually seen in combination with other forms of emphysema
Usually smoking related
Subpleural in location&#8594; may lead to PTX

Panacinar (panlobular) &#8594; affects the entire acinus diffusely throughout the lungs
Emphysematous changes usually most severe at lung bases
Seen with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency

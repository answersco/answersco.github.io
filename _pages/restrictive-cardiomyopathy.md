...

Restrictive cardiomyopathy: characterized by small, stiff, thickened ventricles that impair diastolic filling &#8594; results in dilated atria and ultimately a dilated IVC.
Etiology: may be idiopathic, or due to sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, or myocardial deposition diseases (e.g. amyloidosis).
Restrictive and constrictive physiologies are different entities, though both may feature identical ventricular pressure tracings, and both are characterized by impaired diastolic filling. 
Constrictive physiology is secondary to &#8593; pericardial pressure from thickened (often calcified) pericardium or pericardial effusion, causing impaired diastolic filling.
Main role of imaging the heart in impaired diastolic filling is to exclude constrictive pericarditis, which can be treated surgically, while there is no effective treatment for restrictive CM.
Impaired diastolic filling: may see dilation and reflux of contrast into the IVC and hepatic veins, indicating impaired RV filling and resultant dilation of the RA, IVC, and hepatic veins.

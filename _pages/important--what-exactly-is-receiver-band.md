title: "IMPORTANT: What exactly is receiver bandwidth?"
---
Refers to what frequency differences that are introduced by the frequency encoding gradient between adjacent voxels.

- If you increase receiver bandwidth, you decrease SNR but also type 1 chemical shift.
- More receiver bandwidth means you can read it out faster (due to faster sampling time required to avoid aliasing) thus your TE can be shortened

*rBW does NOT affect SAR. But transmit bandwidth does affect SAR

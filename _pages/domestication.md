title: "Domestication"
---
the taming of animals for human use, such as work or as food

This practice involves modifying animals and plants for human uses. Domesticated animals are tamed, trained, and bred so they become accustomed to living in captivity and helping human beings in some capacity such as serving as sources of food or goods (for example, pelts). Domesticated animals, such as dogs, may also perform work for human beings. Domesticated plants are cultivated and grown as crops, such as wheat. Domestication helped fuel the Neolithic Revolution.

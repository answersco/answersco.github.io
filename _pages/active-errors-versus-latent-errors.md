title: "Active errors versus latent errors"
---
Active errors: occur at the point of contact between a human and some aspect of a larger system (e.g. a human-machine interface)
Generally readily apparent (e.g. pushing an incorrect button)
Almost always involve someone at the front line (&quot;on the sharp end of the scalpel&quot;)

Latent errors (or latent conditions): refer to less apparent failures of organization or design that contribute to the occurrence of errors or allow them to cause harm to patients
Latent errors are those at &quot;the blunt end of the scalpel&quot;&#8594; refer to the many layers of the healthcare system not in direct contact with patients that affect those who do contact patients (&quot;on the sharp end of the scalpel&quot;)
The blunt end: consists of those who set policy, manage healthcare institutions, and design medical devices.
Taken literally, latent errors are &quot;accidents waiting to happen.&quot;

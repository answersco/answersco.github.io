title: "Rules of solubility"
---
1) all compounds containing Na+, K+, and NH4+ are soluble in water
2) all nitrates (NO3-) and acetates (CH3COO-) are soluble in water
3) most chlorides (Cl-) and sulfates (SO4^2-) are soluble except AgCl, BaSO4, and PbSO4)
4) Most carbonates (CO3^2-), phosphates (PO4^3-), sulfides (S2-), and hydroxides (OH-) are insoluble except LiOH, NaOH, KOH, NH4OH are soluble

title: "Focal Spot"
---
Please see image below for testable trivia on the focal spot
Remember, the focal spot is where the electrons hit the anode 
Other important facts about focal spot:
1. Smaller the target angle = smaller focal spot = better spatial resolution
2. Smaller the angle = increased heel effect

Notes:
1. Higher the mA, the WIDER the focal spot which means there is blooming
2. Higher the kVp, the smaller the focal spot, thinning

Part of the anode where bombardment/xray production takes place

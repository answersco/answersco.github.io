title: "What happens in refocusing, frequency-encoding, and readout sequences?"
---
Refocusing&#8594; precession phase of nuclei is altered, allowing readout at TE (&quot;echo time&quot;).
Phase is adjusted using an additional RF excitation.
Refocusing remediates some relaxation (e.g., T2*)

Frequency Encoding&#8594; label nuclei according to position.
Gradient turns on during readout.
Precession frequency in the excited slice is altered along the frequency-encoding axis.
Frequency-encoding axis is perpendicular to phase-encoding axis.

Readout&#8594; raw data inserted in &quot;k-space&quot;

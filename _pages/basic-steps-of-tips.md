title: "Basic steps of TIPS"
---
-Jugular venous access
-Catheterization of hepatic vein (usually right)
-Wedged hepatic venogram (usually with CO2)
-Puncture from HV to intrahepatic PV (usually right portal branch).
-Portal venogram to confirm patency (especially splenic vein)
-Measure pressure gradient (means) between PV and RA.
-Dilatation of parenchymal tract (8-mm diameter, 3-4 cm long balloon).
-Deployment of stent-graft (usually 10-mm diameter, self-expanding)
-Measure gradient: bleeding &lt; 12 mmHg, ascites 50% reduction.
-Further dilatation of shunt or extension if necessary to reduce gradient (consider creating a second [double-barrel] TIPS if gradient still not adequate).
-Embo of varices (in patients with active variceal bleeding)
-Completion portal venogram

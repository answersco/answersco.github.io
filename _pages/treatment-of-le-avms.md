title: "Treatment of LE AVMs"
---
Lesions that cause pain, deformity, bleeding, and high-output heart failure can sometimes be managed with transcatheter embo

Embo of the nidus is essential for effective treatment, but sometimes these are multiple and inaccessible
When possible, occlusion of a dominant venous outflow (ideally temporarily with an occlusion balloon) can facilitate embo of the AVM by slowing flow through the lesions

Common embo agents include glue, other polymers, and alcohol.
Small particles should be avoided whenever large shunts are suspected
Coils placed in arterial inflow vessels have high failure rate due to distal reconstitution around proximal occlusions

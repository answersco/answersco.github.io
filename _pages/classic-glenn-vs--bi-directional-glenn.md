title: "Classic Glenn vs. Bi-Directional Glenn"
---
Classic Glenn: shunt between the SVC and RPA (end-to-end).
Proximal end of the RPA is closed - goal of reducing RV work by diverting all venous return straight to the lung (right lung).

Bi-Directional Glenn: shunt between SVC and RPA (end-to-side).
RPA is left open- leaves blood flow open to both lungs.
Can be used to address right-sided heart problems in general, or as step 2 in palliative hypoplastic series (in which case the BTS or Sano shunt will come down since the Glenn supplies blood to lungs).

Classic Glenn: 
- shunt between the SVC and R Pulmonary Artery (end-to-end).
- Proximal end of the RPA is closed - goal of reducing RV work by diverting all venous return straight to the lung (right lung).

Bi-Directional Glenn: 
- shunt between SVC and RPA (end-to-side).
- RPA is left open- leaves blood flow open to both lungs
- used to address right-sided heart problems in general
- step 2 in palliative hypoplastic series (in which case the BTS or Sano shunt will come down since the Glenn supplies blood to lungs)

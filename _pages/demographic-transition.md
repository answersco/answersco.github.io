A change in the rates of population growth. Before the transition, both birth and death rates are high, resulting in a slowly growing population; then the death rate drops but the birth rate remains high, causing a population explosion. (867)

a hypothesis of population change that states that as populations become industrialized, first their deaths rates and then their birth rates decline; it is separated into 4 distinct stages (preindustrial, transitional, industrial, and postindustrial)

title: "Chemolithotrophy"
---
-oxidation of inorganic compounds for energy
EX donor: nitrite

-only prokaryotes capable of this metabolism
-inorganic molecules oxidized for ATP production such as nitrogen, sulfur, iron, and hydrogen
-electrons from oxidation used in ETC and oxygen is the final electron acceptor
-not as energy efficient as cellular respiration
-most are autotrophs with CO2 as their carbon source
-found in rivers and soil where oxygen is sufficient

title: "Evaluation of vesicoureteral reflux:"
---
Grading of reflux based on VCUG: 90% of grades I and II resolve spontaneously after a few years, and grades III and IV may require surgery.
I: reflux into ureter only, with normal ureteral and calyceal morphology
II: reflux into non-dilated renal calyces, with normal ureteral and calyceal morphology.
III: reflux into renal collecting system, with blunting of calyces
IV: reflux into moderately dilated ureter
V: reflux into severely dilated and tortuous ureter.

Radionuclide cystogram (RNC) &#8594; used for evaluation and follow-up of reflux using Tc-99m-pertechnetate (~ 1 mCi) instilled into bladder.
Most sensitive test to evaluate for reflux.
RNC Grade 1: ureteral reflux only (VCUG I)
RNC Grade 2: reflux reaches renal calyces (VCUG II-III)
RNC Grade 3: ureteral dilation (VCUG IV-V)

Tc-99m-DMSA renal scintigraphy&#8594; gold standard for detection of renal cortical scarring.

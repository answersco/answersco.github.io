title: "Why do we sleep?"
---
-we do not know but it is required
-adaptive: b/c otherwise it was wasted energy searching for food at night (in the dark) like cavement so they just went to bed ---- to dolphins, sleeping seems to be an inconvenience since all mammals sleep and they live in the water
-restorative: wake up refreshed, clear out waste products meaning you studied really hard that day so more sleep is needed

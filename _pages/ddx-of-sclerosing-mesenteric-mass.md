title: "DDX of sclerosing mesenteric mass:"
---
Carcinoid: enhancing soft-tissue mass with radiation linear bands extending into the mesenteric fat, and common calcification.

Desmoid tumor: benign, locally aggressive mass of proliferating fibrous tissue
Sporadic or associated with Gardner syndrome
CT: most are isoattenuating to muscle, but large tumors may show central necrosis
Characteristic feature: strands of tissue radiation into the adjacent mesenteric fat (similar to carcinoid and sclerosing mesenteritis)

Sclerosing mesenteritis: rare inflammatory condition that leads to fatty necrosis and fibrosis of the mesenteric root
Imaging: mesenteric masses with striations of soft tissue extending into the adjacent fat. 
Calcification may be present
Mesenteric panniculitis: variant with predominant inflammation
Misty mesentery, sometimes with linear bands of soft tissue representing early fibrosis

title: "Parallel collimator"
---
The work horse. Want collimator and detector as close to patient as possible to increase spatial resolution. Sensitivity is NOT affected by distance
Septal length: longer = better spatial resolution, shorter = increased sensitivity
Hole diameter: Wider = better sensitivity but lower spatial res
Septal thickeness: Thick = less penetration (should be used with higher energy molecules), Thin = more penetration (can be used with lower energy). Also THICK septa decrease the space for photons to go through therefore decreased sensitivity.

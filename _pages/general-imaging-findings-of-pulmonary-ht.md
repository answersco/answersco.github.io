title: "General imaging findings of pulmonary HTN:"
---
Main PA diameter &gt; 2.9 cm suggests presence of pulmonary HTN, thought pulmonary HTN may be present with main caliber PA.
Main PA diameter larger than aortic root diameter is also suggestive of pulmonary HTN.
Pulmonary artery calcifications: pathognomonic for chronic pulmonary arterial HTN
PAH: may cause mosaic attenuation due to perfusion abnormalities, most commonly in CTEPH.
May be associated with ground-glass centrilobular nodules, especially in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease.
Hilum convergence sign: describes appearance of hilar PA branches converging into an enlarged PA &#8594; confirms that &quot;mass&quot; represents the PA
Hilum overlay sign: describes the visualization of hilar vessels through a mass &#8594; indicates presence of a mediastinal mass, which cannot be in middle mediastinum (usually anterior)

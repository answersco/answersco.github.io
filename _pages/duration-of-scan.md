title: "Duration of scan"

= TR X NPy X Nex

Npy = number of phase incoding steps
Nex = number of excitations
TR = time to repetition

THIS APPLYS FOR SPIN ECHO AND GRADIENT ECHO

Note:

Times when this formula does not apply are FAST SPIN ECHO and 3D IMAGING 

For 3d IMaging, scan time = TR X Phase matrix X Nex X Number of slices
For Fast spin echo, scan time = 1/echo train length

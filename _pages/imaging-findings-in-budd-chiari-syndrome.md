BCS: common global obstruction of hepatic venous drainage, leading to hepatic congestion and sinusoidal HTN

CT: massive ascites, hepatosplenomegaly, slit-like or obliterated HVs, intrahepatic HV-HV collaterals, HV or IVC webs, patchy fan-shaped enhancement of parenchyma (nutmeg) with sparing of the caudate lobe.

US: may show absent or dampened hepatic venous flow with loss of transmitted atrial waves.

Chronic BCS: may see hypertrophy of caudate and atrophy of right lobe, gastroesophageal varices.

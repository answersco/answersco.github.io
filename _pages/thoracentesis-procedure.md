title: "Thoracentesis procedure"
---
1) Position pt upright, either on side of bed leaning slightly over on bedside table or straddling a chair with arms resting on back of chair
-Upright position facilitates the removal of fluid, expands the rubs, and widens the intercostal space to aid needle insertions

2) Prepare pt for cold sensation of skin antiseptic and for pressure sensation from infiltration of local anesthetic. Encourage pt to refrain from coughing. Educate pt on the importance of remaining immobile, pressure sensation to be experienced, and minimal discomfort anticipated after procedure.

3) Expose the entire chest. The site of aspiration is visualized by chest x-ray and percussion and if fluid in pleural cavity, then the thoracentesis site is determined by chest x-ray, ultrasound, or fluoroscopy and physical findings, with attention to the site of maximal dullness on percussion.
-Chest x-rays used to localize fluid and air in pleural cavity to aid in determining puncture site.
-Ultrasound scans are performs to help select the best site for needle 
aspiration.

4) The procedure is performed under aseptic conditions. Once skin is cleansed, physician uses small caliber needle to administer local anesthetic slowly into the intercostal space.

5) The physician advances the thoracentesis needle with syringe attached until pleural space is reached. Suction may be applied with the syringe.

6) After needle is withdrawn, pressure is applied and airtight, sterile dressing is put on.

7) Advise pt chest x-ray will be obtained to verify there is no pneumothorax

8) Record total amount of fluid withdrawn, adding the nature of the fluid, its color, and its viscosity. 
Bloody fluid could indicate malignancy and purulent fluid could indicate infections

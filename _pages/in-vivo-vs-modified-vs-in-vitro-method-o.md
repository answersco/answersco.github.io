title: "In vivo vs Modified vs In vitro method of RBC labeling with Tc99?"
---
In vivo = injected tin and Tc99m Pertechnetate into patient (least amount bound 60-80%) - dirty image; fails if there's heparinized tubing or recent IV contrast

Modified = Inject tin into patient, withdrew 3-5 cc into a syringe and add Tc99m Pertechnetate + anticoagulant, then reject 10 min later
- 85% bound (still can interact with heparin and fail)

In vitro = Blood withdrawn and both Tin and Tc are added, then reinjected
- BEST 98% bound (but most expensive)

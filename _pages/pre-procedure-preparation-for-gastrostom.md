title: "Pre-procedure preparation for gastrostomy"
---
Referring team asked to place NG tube on evening before
Administer 300 mL or an oral barium suspension
+/- paralytic agent such as glucagon or n-hyoscine butyl bromide to induce gastric paralysis

Barium can be omitted if needed because colon can often be identified on fluoro without barium. 
Also, adequately distending stomach with air often pushes transverse colon inferiorly
If needed, air can be insufflated via rectal tube or lateral fluoro can be used to further localize the stomach

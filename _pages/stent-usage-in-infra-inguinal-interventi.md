title: "Stent usage in infra-inguinal interventions"

When the results of angioplasty (PTA) are unsatisfactory or when extensive disease is present, bare-metal stents or stent-grafts improve the lumen.

Balloon-expandable stents shouldn't be used in SFA or popliteal artery because they can be crushed by external forces.

The choice between bare-metal stent and stent-graft is often subjective.
-Stent-grafts usually require larger diameter delivery systems and exclude potential collateral branches
-Bare-metal stents are subject to restenosis over their entire length.
-For both, it is important to limit balloon inflations beyond the ends of the stent or stent-graft to decrease the occurrence of intimal hyperplasia in these locations.

Intravascular brachytherapy and DES may decrease intimal hyperplasia.

title: "What is the characteristic finding of an Ostium secundum atrial septal defect?"

A LARGE defect in the MID ASPECT of the interatrial septum is essentially diagnostic of this condition. A PFO would appear similarly but would be smaller in size. A ostium primum defect is more anterior and inferior.

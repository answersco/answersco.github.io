title: "How does the left side of the brain differ from the right side?"
---
-Studies with split-brain patients, in which the corpus callosum has been severed to correct epilepsy, reveal that the left side of the brain seems to control language, writing, logical thought, analysis, and mathematical abilities. The left side also processes information sequentially.

-The right side of the brain processes information globally and controls emotional expression, spatial perception, recognition of faces, patterns, melodies, and emotions. Information presented only to the left hemisphere can be verbalized, but information sent only to the right cannot.

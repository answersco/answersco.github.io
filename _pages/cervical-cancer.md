title: "Cervical Cancer"

1. T1
*Confined to cervix or uterus

2. T2a
*Upper 2/3 of the vagina

3. T2b
&quot;Buffer zone&quot;
*Parametrial involvement

4. T3a
*Lower 1/3 of the vagina

5. T3b
&quot;Wall or water&quot;
*Pelvic side wall or hydronephrosis

-HPV-related
-SCC
-unresectable = IIB = parametrial involvement
-stage IIIA = lower third vaginal involvement

This is almost always going to be squamous cell carcinoma related to HPV
STAGING is likely going to be the critical question:

*<b>Staging pearls</b>*
Differentiation of stage 2a vs 2b
2a = NO parametrial invasion
2b = parametrial invasion

VAGINAL PEARLS:

Met to the anterior vagina = ALMOST always genitourinary cancer (think location)
Met to the posterior vagina = ALMOST always GI cancer (think location)

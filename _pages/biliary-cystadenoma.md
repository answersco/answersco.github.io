title: "Biliary cystadenoma:"
---
Biliary cystadenoma: benign cystic neoplasm, predominantly in middle-aged women. 
Can be large at presentation, and cause nonspecific symptoms such as pain, N/V, and obstructive jaundice
Does not communicate with the biliary system
Imaging: appears as a large, multiloculated cystic mass. Septations distinguish it from a simple cyst, but can mimic echinococcal cyst.
In contrast to a hepatic abscess or necrotic metastasis, a thick enhancing wall is not a feature of cystadenoma.
May uncommonly recur after resection.
Rare degeneration into biliary cystadenocarcinoma&#8594; may see large solid component or thick calcification.

Benign cystic mass lined with biliary type epithelium

title: "Petrous apex: cholesterol granuloma vs cholesteatoma"
---
Cholesterol granuloma: most common primary petrous apex lesion
Acquired lesions, most commonly presenting with hearing loss
CT: well-defined margins
MRI: T1- and T2-bright, with T2-dark hemosiderin rim, and faint peripheral enhanement.
Slow-growing ones watched, fast-growing ones resected

Cholesteatoma: congenital lesions of petrous apex
Typically slow-growing&#8594; produce bony changes similar to those with cholesterol granuloma
MRI: T1 DARK, T2 bright, RESTRICTED DIFFUSION

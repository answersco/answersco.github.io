title: "Vascular spasm"
---
-first stage in hemostasis
-involves vasoconstriction

-most immediate protection against blood loss
-causes of vasoconstriction: some pain receptors directly innervate blood vessels to constrict, smooth muscle injury, and platelets release serotonin enhances vasoconstriction
-effects: prompt constriction of a broken blood vessels -- pain receptors take short duration while smooth muscle injuries take long duration
-provides time for other two clotting pathways

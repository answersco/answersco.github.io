title: "What is the mechanism of computed radiography?"
---
In computed radiography an imaging cassette with an imaging plate (storage phosphor) is exposed to x-rays when imaging. The imaging plate is inserted into a reader, which scans the plate with a red laser. Trapped energy from x-ray photon interaction is released as blue light, which is routed by a fiber optic light guide to a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The electronic signal from the PMT is digitized and stored as a digital image.

title: "Active shimming: technique, advantages, disadvantages"
---
Active shimming&#8594; performed using an extra set of small, oddly-shaped coils, strategically positioned inside the main magnet.
The size, location, and shape of each coil are carefully chosen so that the magnetic field produced by a given coil is proportional to a given power distance from magnetic isocenter&#8594; called a shim order.
The shimming process&#8594; consists of running small DC currents through these coils and finely tweaking these currents until optimal homogeneity of the main field is achieved.
The # of coils rapidly &#8593; with the shim order.
Disadvantage&#8594; the process of shimming is tedious and time-consuming, as well as approximate.
Performance of a shimming system&#8594; improves with &#8593; # of coils used, but so do the cost and complexity of the process.

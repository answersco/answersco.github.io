title: "Categories and types of embolic agents:"
---
Embolic materials: 
2 main categories:
Permanent: coils, particles, glue, and sclerosing agents
Temporary: absorbable gelatin sponge and autologous clot

Coils: create thrombosis by inducing vascular stasis
Main advantage: ability for precise and quick placement, without distal embolization
Disadvantage: sacrifice of distal access. Once coiled, a vessel cannot be reaccessed for treatment.
Technique: generally first coil distal to the lesion, then proximal to it &#8594; prevents recurrent bleeding from retrograde collaterals.

Particles: flow distally to occlude the small capillaries
Trisacyl gelatin microspheres (Embospheres) and polyvinyl alcohol

Absorbable gelatin sponge (Gelfoam) &#8594; most commonly used temporary agent, lasting 2-6 weeks.
Postprocedural CT can show numerous gas locules in the embolized organ.

Sodium tetradecyl sulfate: sclerosing agent used for vascular malformations and varices.

Cyanoacrylate: special glue that rapidly hardens when int comes into contact with blood.

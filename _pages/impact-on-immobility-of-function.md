title: "Impact on immobility of function"
---
1) sleep and rest: tough to know when to go to sleep and when to wake up when your laying in bed for so long 
2) cognition and perception: perception can be altered by immobility bc you do not have the normal cues and stimulation you take in usually all day long so that is when hallucination begins 
3) self-perception and self-concept: can be hard to become dependent all of a sudden
4) roles and relationships 
5) coping and stress tolerance: often, people who are immobile have less ability to deal with stress, &quot;world&quot; becomes limited to the hospital bed and room and rather uncontrollable so it is good to give them control of whatever they can in that environment 
6) sexuality

title: "What is twin reversed arterial perfusion syndrome"
---
you can get intraplacental shunting that results in a &quot;pump twin&quot; who will pump blood to the other twin
- other twin is &quot;acardiac&quot; (without a heart)
- &quot;pump twin&quot; is usually normal

- could show doppler ultrasound demonstrating umbilical artery flow toward the acardiac twin
- or venous flow away from the acardiac twin

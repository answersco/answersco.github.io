---
Lower lobe predominant (more blood flow)
Peripheral nodule densities and wedge-shaped densities (infarct)
Can cavitate
Feeding vessel sign (also seen in hematogenous mets): nodule with big vessel going into it.
Can have empyema, PTX

CAVITY
Cancer (usually SCC)
Auto-immune: Wegener's, RA, Caplan syndrome
Vascular: septic emboli, bland emboli
Infection: TB
Trauma: pneumatoceles

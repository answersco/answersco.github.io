title: "IMPORTANT: US Axial resolution is what? At minimum, you need what to see 2 things separately?"
---
Ability to tell 2 closely spaced objects apart in the DIRECTION OF YOUR US BEAM.

- At minimum, you need the objects to be &gt; 1/2 spatial pulse length (SPL) apart (or else you cannot resolve them as 2 separate things!) 
- it is CONSTANT at different depths (only depends on the SPL)
- improve by more dampening (shortens your SPL) or using higher frequency probe (shorter wavelength)

title: "Stem cells applications"
---
-stem cells are being used in four basic ways
1) discovery and development of drugs (i.e., making tissues to test drugs)
2) studying the earliest sign of disease (e.g., iPS cells for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS)
3) treatment of disease via implants and transplants (e.g., bone marrow transplant)
4) stimulating stem cells in the body via the introduction of reprogramming proteins

title: "How do we use TR and TE to emphasize T2 and PD contrast?"
---
In order to emphasize T2 contrast:
&#8594; The TE has to be set to long values (comparable to the T2 of the tissues).
&#8594; and the TR must be set to long values in order to minimize differences in contrast due to T1.

In order to obtain proton-density (PD) contrast:
TE is kept low.
TR is kept high to minimize both T2 and T1-weighted contrast.

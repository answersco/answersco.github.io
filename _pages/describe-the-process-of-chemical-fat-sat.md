title: "Describe the process of chemical fat saturation."

Chem Sat can suppress any tissue with a unique chemical shift, such as fat, Si, and H20. It uses a narrow bandwidth presaturation pulse that selectively eliminates the longitudinal magnetization of the target tissue, followed by the routine excitation pulse after a brief interval (during which the target tissue cannot recover much longitudinal magnetization).

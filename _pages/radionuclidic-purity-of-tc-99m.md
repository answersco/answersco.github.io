title: "Radionuclidic purity of Tc-99m"
---
Radionuclidic purity: tested after washing off Tc from aluminum column using saline
-Evaluating for residual molybdenum (T1/2 67 hours)
-Sample placed behind lead shield and Mo assayed for first. High energy photons of Mo (~740 keV) will NOT be attenuated by the shield, but the 140 keV Tc photons will.
-NRC allows no more than 0.15 microCi of Mo per 1 milliCi of Tc at the time of administration.

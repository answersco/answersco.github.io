title: "Artifact commonly seen at the liver/lung interface"
---
Mirror-image artifact: 
US beam passes through a highly-reflective surface, then gets repeatedly reflected between the back side of the reflector and the adjacent structure.
Appears as a duplication equidistant from but deep to the strongly reflective surface.
Classic location along liver/lung interface &#8594; see liver parenchyma where you should see lung.

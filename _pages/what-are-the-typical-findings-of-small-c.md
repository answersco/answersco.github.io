title: "What are the typical findings of small cell lung ca? What is SCLC? Tx? Prognosis?"
---
Bulky mediastinal LAD or Mass. Less likely an infiltrative central lung mass contiguous with extensive mediastinal LAD. SCLC is an aggressive, high-grade neuroendocrine malignancy that is strongly linked to cigarette smoking. Tx is chemo and RT. Worse prognosis compared to NSCLC.

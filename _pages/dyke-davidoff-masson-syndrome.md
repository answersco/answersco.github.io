title: "Dyke Davidoff Masson syndrome"
---
The Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome (DDMS) was initially described as changes in the skull seen on skull X-ray in patients with cerebral hemiatrophy, but is now applied more broadly to cross-sectional imaging also. It is characterised by :

thickening of the skull vault (compensatory)
enlargement of the frontal sinus (also ethmoidal and mastoid air-cells)
elevation of the petrous ridge
ipsilateral falcine displacement

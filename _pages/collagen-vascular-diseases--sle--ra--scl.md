1. SLE = pleural and pericardial effusions; Shrinking Lung
2. RA = looks like UIP and COP in lower lobes (e.g. honeycombing, opacities), or possibly air trapping and constrictive bronchiolitis + Cavitating necrobiotic lung nodules
3. Scleroderma = Looks like NSIP; look for dilated fluid filled esophagus! (duh - Crest syndrome)
4. Sjogrens = looks like LIP (GROUND GLASS with scattered thin walled cysts)
5. Ank Spond = Upper lobe fibrobullous disease

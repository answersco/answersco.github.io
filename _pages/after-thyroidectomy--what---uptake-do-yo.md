title: "After thyroidectomy, what % uptake do you want (what is ideal) - what if it is above the ideal uptake?"
---
- uptake is from the residual thyroid
- I-131 (small dose) given to see how much thyroid left
- &lt; 5% uptake is ideal
- otherwise ablation will be painful (may need steroids or go back to OR)

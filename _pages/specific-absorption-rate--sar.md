title: "Specific absorption rate (SAR)"
---
Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) &#8594; describes the RF power absorbed by the patient's body.
Expressed in units of W/kg&#8594; represents the average energy deposited in one kilogram of tissue per second, averaged over some set scanning time.
Proportional to # of images acquired per unit time and depends on patient dimensions, RF waveform, tip angle, and coil type.

title: "Secondary wound healing"
---
-usually how a stage 3 or stage 4 pressure ulcer heals
-full thickness skin loss
-edges are far apart and not well approximated
-wound has to fill up from bottom up with granulation tissue eventually when the wound contracts enough and the granulation tissue comes close enough to the surface, the epithelial layers will close the wound
-more susceptible to infection
-scar is larger

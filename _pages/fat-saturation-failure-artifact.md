title: "Fat-saturation failure artifact"
---
Appearance&#8594; varying signal intensity in fatty tissues when fat-saturation is applied.
Causes&#8594; resonant frequency of fat is not uniform in the image.
Common Occurrences&#8594; 
MRI scanner with poorly-shimmed magnetic fields.
Anatomy is distant from magnet isocenter (e.g. shoulder).
If the resonant frequency of fat doesn't match the special RF pulse &#8594; fat-sat will fail, and some fat will be bright on the image.
Failures can result from poor uniformity of the bulk magnetic field of the scanner.
Remedy&#8594; 
Apply shimming within the region of interest, and try not to include air in the shimming volume.
Move the anatomy as close as possible to the isocenter.
For fingers&#8594; ask the patient to hold them together.

title: "Colloid shift"
---
Severe hepatic dysfunction leading to increased T99m Sulfur colloid activity in spleen, lungs, kidneys

Due to:
cirrhosis
diffuse hepatic mets
fatty infiltration of liver
hepatitis
hemochromatosis
amyloidosis
lymphoma
leukemia
sarcoidosis

**all hepatic masses are cold on SC except FNH

Incr in spleen/BM. a/w cirrhosis, liver dysfunction

Increased uptake in spleen and marrow on colloid scan- liver dysfunction usually due to cirrhosis

Normal SC scan, 85% of colloid taken up by liver (10% spleen, 5% BM).
In setting of diffuse hepatic dysfunction, portal HTN, hypersplenism, or BM activation, you can see a change in uptake, with shift to spleen and BM
Most specific causes of colloid shift: cirrhosis, diffuse liver mets, DM, and blunt trauma to spleen.

In cirrhosis, there is more uptake in spleen on Tc 99 sulfur colloid studies, which is abnormal.

Refers to Tc sulfur colloid
This is where you have INCREASED uptake in the spleen (remember liver should normally take up 85%)
This is normally due to cirrhosis, diffuse hepatic dysfunction, hypersplenism

title: "IMPORTANT: How are eddy currents in MRI created and how to they affect images?"
---
Created by rapidly changing the magnetic field gradient --&gt; parasitic electric currents within the conductor --&gt; deterioration of image quality (looks like distortion of the image or shift/shear)
- e.g. DWI imaging
- Improve by optimizing the sequence of gradient pulses
* the currents themselves are in the magnet, cables, wires, or even the patient.

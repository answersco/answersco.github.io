title: "Star artifact"
---
In you have very focal intense energy, you can sometimes see star artifact, caused by septal penetration of the hexagonal collimator holes.
Typically seen in thyroid bed after high therapeutic dose (using medium energy collimator instead of high)

This is due to septal penetration.

Caused by septal penetration of hexagonally oriented collimator holes by very high energy focal source (think post-therapy I131)

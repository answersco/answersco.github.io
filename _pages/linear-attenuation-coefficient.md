title: "Linear attenuation coefficient"
---
ability of an object to attenuate the xray beam is assigned a value
Basically the coefficient is going to be the percentage of photons that are ABSORBED by 1cm thick slice of the material

The portion of photons that gets attenuated per unit thickness. Ex: LAC of 0.1/cm would mean that 10% of the beam gets attenuated per cm of material. Kind of inverse to half value layer.

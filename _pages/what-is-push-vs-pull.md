title: "What is PUSH vs PULL?"
---
PUSH = in industry = you make something even if no one is buying it
- e.g. we will make 500 cars and push em out this month
- you can't decide to take 300 CXRs if they're not being ordered so &quot;PUSH&quot; doesn't exist much in medicine

PULL = you pull resources to match teh demand (e.g. if there are 50 CTs ordered in the BIDMC ED, you better pull a tech and another resident to help read)

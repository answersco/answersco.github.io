title: "Right versus left ribs on lateral CXR"
---
By convention, lateral CXR taken in left lateral position (left side against the film/cassette).
Thus, the left ribs will not be magnified (right ribs more magnified)
Right ribs also project more posteriorly.
Another strategy is to follow the diaphragm over the stomach bubble.
Right major fissure is anterior to the left major fissure

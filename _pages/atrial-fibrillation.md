title: "Atrial fibrillation"
---
-where instead of the atriums pumping like they are supposed to, they quiver
-at increased risk for clot formation
-most pt's are placed on a blood thinner (anticoagulant)
-not uncommon for them to come in and out of this dysrhythmia

-less serious
-SA node not sending out a synchronized signal causing irregular contraction

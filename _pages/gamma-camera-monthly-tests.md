title: "Gamma camera monthly tests"
---
Monthly Tests&#8594; examine functionality of the camera for a range of different combinations of radioisotopes and collimators that will be used clinically.
Any &quot;dings&quot; in the collimators should show up here
Should also show any unexpected differences in performance of the different energies.
Flood tests will be performed&#8594; integral and differential uniformity calculated
No results should be &lt; 10%
Flood phantoms might be alternated with Jascszak phantoms to test spatial resolution instead of uniformity&#8594; could optionally be run quarterly instead of monthly.

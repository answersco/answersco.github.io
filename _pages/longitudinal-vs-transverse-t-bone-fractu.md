title: "Longitudinal vs Transverse T-bone fracture: - which one is more common - which one has ossicular dislocation? - more vascular injury? what vessels? - which has more facial nerve damage? - which one has conductive hearing loss? - sensorineural hearing loss?"

- Longitudinal is more common
- lOngitudinal: Ossicular dislocation
- transVerse: Vascular injury (carotid, jugular)
- facial nerve damage: transverse
- conductive hearing loss: longitudinal
- sensorineural hearing loss: transverse

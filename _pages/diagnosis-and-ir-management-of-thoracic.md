Transection: appears on aortography as an irregular collection of contrast beyond the normal aortic lumen.
May be partial (55%) or circumferential (45%)
The presence of any sharp or irregular contour helps distinguish transection from ductus bump or diverticulum, which have smooth walls, gentle contour, and no sharp or acute angles or irregularity.
Rarely patients with undiagnosed aortic transection survive to present years later with focal calcified descending thoracic Ao aneurysm.

Transection: traditionally treated with surgical placement of an aortic interposition tube graft.
Stent-grafts are increasingly used to exclude traumatic aortic pseudoaneurysm.
-May require covering the left subclavian artery in order to obtain an adequate proximal seal. Patency of right vert and normal left vert should be confirmed to decrease risk of posterior fossa stroke.

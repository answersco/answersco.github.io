title: "Paraspinal lines:"
---
Right and left paraspinal lines: appear as lines due to Mach effect
Formed by 2 layers of pleura abutting the posterior mediastinum
In contrast to the posterior junction line, the paraspinal lines are located inferiorly in the thorax, typically from the 8th-12th ribs
Paraspinal line abnormality: suggests posterior mediastinal mass lesion, including hematoma, neurogenic tumor, aortic aneurysm, extramedullary hematopoiesis, esophageal mass, and osteophyte.

title: "Regulation of salivation"
---
-salivatory nuclei in brain stem
-food stimulates taste buds
-send signals by way of autonomic fibers in the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves to the glands
-parasympathetic fibers stimulate the glands to produce an abundance of thin, enzyme-rich saliva
-sympathetic activity stimulates the glands to produce less, and thicker, saliva with more mucus
-conserves water

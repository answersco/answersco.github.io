5 types:

1. Focal dilation of the CBD (by far the most common)
2. Type 2 is a diverticulum of the CBD (very rare)
3. Type 3 choledochocele (very rare) (choledochocele is where the portion of the duct that is dilated is the portion that is INTRAMURAL within the duodenal wall)
4. Type 4: both INTRA and EXTRA hepatic
5. Type 5: CAROLI's DISEASE: purely intrahepatic, AR recessive, associated with polycystic kidney and medullary sponge kidney, look for the CENTRAL DOT SIGN (portal vein surrounded by dilated bile ducts)

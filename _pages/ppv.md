title: "PPV"

Positive predictive value (PPV): the proportion of people with positive test results that actually have the disease (i.e. are correctly diagnosed with the disease)
PPV = TP / (TP + FP) [TP + FP = total # who test positive]
PPV depends on the prevalence of disease
If prevalence of disease in the subject group is not similar to the prevalence in the population, likelihood ratios should be used instead of PPV/NPV.
Case-control studies (which do not yield prevalence) cannot be used to estimate PPV or NPV.

TP/TP+FP

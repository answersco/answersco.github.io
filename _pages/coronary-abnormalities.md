Most clinically significant is the inter-atrial course of the LCA from a common origin with the RCA from the right coronary sinus. The anomalous course of the LCA is between the Ao and PA.

Most common is myocardial bridging. Clinical significance is association with ischemia. Depth of course is more important than length of bridge.

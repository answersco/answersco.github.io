title: "Angio appearance and IR treatment of hepatic hemangiomas"
---
Angiographic appearance is distinctive: normal feeding arteries, with early pooling of contrast that increases and persists with time (&quot;comes early and stays late&quot;).
-TACE (lipiodol and bleomycin) of symptomatic giant lesions (giant &gt; 5 cm) is an alternative to surgical resection.

Infantile hemanioendothelioma: most common benign hepatic tumor in infants, often presenting with hepatomegaly or high output heart failure.
-Lesions usually respond to steroids of IFN-a, but embo or resection may be required.
-Angio: may see recruitment of collateral arterial supply from phrenic, intercostal, abdominal wall, splenic, superior mesenteric, or renal arteries.
-Tx: embo with Gelfoam pledglets or cyanoacrylate glue is frequently curative. Small particles avoided due to risk of shunting through the mass.

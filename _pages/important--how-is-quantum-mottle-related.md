title: "IMPORTANT: How is quantum mottle related to the number of photons by Slice thickness?"
---
Mottle is inversely related to the SQUARE ROOT of the number of photons

- So if you scan at 2.5 mm slices then reconstruct as 10 mm slices (4x the number of photons in one image), you Decrease Mottle by factor of 2!

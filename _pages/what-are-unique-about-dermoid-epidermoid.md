title: "What are unique about dermoid/epidermoids of the orbit? Where they occur, how they look, and how they are tx?"
---
They almost always occur near the sutures of the orbital bones ie in the superior and temporal quadrant of the orbit at or near the frontozygomatic suture. They are usually superficial (but can be intraorbital) and grow slowly. CT and MRI characteristics are those of other dermoid/epidermoid lesion. Tx is surgical.

title: "US for chronic venous insufficiency"
---
Exam performed with patient standing, with segmental evaluation to localize abnormal veins
-GSV, SSV, anterior and posterior accessory GSVs, and deep veins should be studied.
-Limb below the vein is either briefly compressed manually or with automated cuff rapidly deflated as flow is interrogated with color or duplex US.
-Reversal of flow &lt; 0.5 seconds is normal, because time is needed for valve closure.
-Reversal of flow in superficial veins &gt; 0.5 seconds indicates valvular incompetence
-Reversal of flow &gt; 1 second considered severe
-In deep veins, reversal of flow up to 1 second is acceptable.
-Dilated (&gt;/= 3.5 mm) incompetent (flow reversal &gt;/= 0.5 s) perforating veins underlying venous ulcers are considered pathologic

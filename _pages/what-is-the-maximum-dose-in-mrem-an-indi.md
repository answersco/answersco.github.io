title: "What is the maximum dose in mrem an individual member of the public may receive from the release of patients injected with radioactive materials (e.g. after thyroid ablation)?"

500 mrem

The dose limit to a general member of the public from activities performed involving the use of radiation is 100 mrem. The 500 mrem limit applies to scenarios when the dose to the patient and the exposure scenario are defined (e.g. family member of a patient treated with I-131).

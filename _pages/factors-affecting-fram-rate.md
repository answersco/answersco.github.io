title: "Factors affecting fram rate"
---
Remember the formula:

Max frame rate = pulse repition frequency/number of scan lines per frame (N)

Factors that affect pulse repitition frequency are:
1. Depth of image (longer to return)
2. Speed of sound 

Also, remember that the NUMBER of focal zones will affect the frame rate. The MORE focal zones, the LOWER the frame rate,

-breaks down starch/carbs

-We compared two fresh starch samples at various timepoints. One starch sample with nothing added, and another starch sample with the digestive enzyme amylase added to it. Amylase breaks down starch. At each timepoint, we added iodine to both samples to detect if there was still starch present. Iodine turns blue (brown) in the presence of starch, or brown (black) when no starch is present. Both samples kept yielding a blue (brown) color until 8 minutes when the sample with amylase turned brown (black). Brown (black) = no starch present.

-if moving towards blood, it's being reabsorbed
-all glucose is immediately reabsorbed in PCT
-70ish % of salts are immediately reabsorbed in PCT
-loop is used to tweak concentrations of salt/water, draw out more

-ascending limb actively transports salts, impermeable to water
-water and some urea (to maintain osmotic pressures) are reabsorbed from collecting duct

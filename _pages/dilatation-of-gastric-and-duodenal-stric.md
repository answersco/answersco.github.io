title: "Dilatation of gastric and duodenal strictures"
---
Strictures of gastric antrum, pylorus, and duodenum can also be dilated.
20-30-mm baloons are usually necessary in these locations.
These strictures are often more technically challenging than esophageal strictures. 
-Although a long 5-Fr angiographic catheter can be tried initially, it may be necessary to use stiffer catheters such as those used for duodenal intubation.

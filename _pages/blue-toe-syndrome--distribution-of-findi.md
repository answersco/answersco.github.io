title: "Blue-toe syndrome: distribution of findings and source"
---
Blue-toe syndrome: lower-extremity microembolization presenting with sudden onset of painful, localized red-purple discolorations of one or more toes due to spontaneous rupture of atherosclerotic plaque.

Unilateral extremity symptoms: usually indicate an inline source (CIA or distal), especially when recurrent

Bilateral limb involvement: suggestive of Ao or more proximal source

When renal failure occurs synchronously with the LE symptoms, a thoracic Ao source with concurrent cholesterol embo of the kidneys should be suspected

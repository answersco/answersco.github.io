title: "Receiver bandwidth"
---
High receiver band width means that you are going to have a SHORT sampling time - you need this in order to catch HIGH frequency signals
Low receiver band width - this is going to have a HIGHER sampling time

Frequencies expected by receiving coil
MHz/voxel in frequency encoding direction
Increased bandwidth -&gt; decreased SNR, decreased type 1 chemical shift

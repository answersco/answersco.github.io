title: "Common findings with cervical hyperflexion-rotation injury:"
---
A distraction, asymmetric rotational pattern of injury suggests hyperflexion-rotation cervical spine injury.
Facet injuries include diastasis, subluxation, dislocation, and fracture.
Asymmetric posterior involvement, e.g. perched facet on one side and comminuted fracture on contralateral side.
Common offset of laminar space.

title: "Describe Nonobstructive atelectasis"
---
Nonobstructive atelectasis can be caused by loss of contact between the parietal and visceral pleurae, compression, loss of surfactant, and replacement of parenchymal tissue by scarring or infiltrative disease. Nonobstructive atelectasis may be further subdivided into:
- Relaxation or passive atelectasis results when a pleural effusion or a pneumothorax eliminates contact between the parietal and visceral pleurae.
- Compression atelectasis occurs from any space-occupying lesion of the thorax compressing the lung and forcing air out of the alveoli. The mechanism is similar to relaxation atelectasis.

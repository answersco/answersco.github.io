Esophageal lesions. Foregut cysts. Vertebral lesion. Lateral thoracic meningocele. Pancreatic pseudocyst.

Posterior mediastinal mass
Neurogenic tumor: most adult tumors are peripheral nerve sheath tumors and the vast majority in children are of sympathetic ganglionic origin.
Peripheral nerve tumors (more common in adults)
Schwannoma (#1), neurofibroma, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.
Sympathetic ganglion tumors (more common in younger patients)
Ganglioneuroma (#1), neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma (intermediate histology between ganglioneuroma and neuroblastoma, seen in older children than neuroblastoma)
Hiatal hernia
Descending thoracic aortic aneurysm
Extramedullary hematopoiesis &#8594; causes soft tissue paravertebral masses in patients with severe hereditary anemias (e.g. thalassemia or sickle cell)
Lobulated soft tissue masses, usually bilateral and inferior to T6
Lateral meningocele&#8594; lateral herniation of the spinal meninges through either an intervertebral foramen or a defect in the vertebral body.
Associated with neurofibromatosis
Esophageal neoplasm
Carcinoma&#8594; abnormal convexity of azygoesophageal recess, mediastinal widening, or retrotracheal mass.
Benign tumors (e.g. leiomyoma, fibroma, or lipoma) may appear similarly on XR
Foregut duplication cyst&#8594; middle or posterior mediastinal mass
Paraspinal abscess &#8594; paraspinal line displacement

Neuroblastoma: most common posterior mediastinal mass in children under 2 (thoracic neuroblastoma has a much better outcome)
Neuroenteric cysts: these by definition have to be associated with a vertebral anomaly (think scoliosis) included picture is a NE cyst
Extramedullary hematopoiesis: normally occurs in spleen and liver (megally) however you can soft tissue denisty around the spine (paraspinal mass) which are bilateral, smooth, and sparply delineated

Neurogenic: MC: schwannomas, neurofibromas, malignantperipheral nerve sheath tumors

Bone Marrow: extramedulla hematopoisesis, 2nd to CML, polycythemia, myelofibrosis, SC and thalassemia

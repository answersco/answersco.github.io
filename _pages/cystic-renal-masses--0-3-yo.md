Multicystic dysplastic kidney
1. Numerous tiny cysts in utero
2. there is NO functioning renal tissue
3. Contralateral renal tract abnormality occurs in 50% of cases (most common UPJ obstruction)
NOTE: nuclear medicine DTPA or MAG-3 scan can be used to figure out if this is hydronephrosis vs. MCDK. For MCDK you will NOT SEE ANY excretion and most of the time yOU WILL NOT SEE ANY PARYNCHYMAL ACTIVITY as all the tissue is destroyed.

title: "Hunting-foraging societies"
---
These societies were usually composed of small kinship groups that were nomadic and often self-sufficient. Typically, males hunted wild animals while females foraged for wild plants, such as nuts, vegetables, and fruits. Hunter-foragers moved from place to place to follow the migrations of wild game and locate better places to forage. Usually, they lived in temporary dwellings and had few possesions, making movement easier. However, hunter-foragers did develop tools that helped them adapt to different environments. People generally lived this way before 10,000 B.C.E.

EIVs and IIVs join at roughly the level of the SI joints to form the CIVs
-CIVs form deep in pelvis, so the CIVs are angled anteriorly and cranially
-CIVs don't have valves
-R CIV has vertical course posterior to the right CIA
-L CIV located medial to L CIA. It passes under the right CIA and anterior to S1 or L5 to reach IVC on the right. Frequently results in broadening of the left CIV and sometimes functional compression.

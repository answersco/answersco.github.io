title: "Angioplasty (PTA) and stent usage in DVT"
---
Angioplasty and stent placement are required in the iliac veins in up to 70% of patients
-Underlying May-Thurner syndrome: almost always requires stent placement. 
-Self-expanding stents should be sized at least 2-3 mm larger in diameter than the normal diameter of the vein
-When stenting CIVs, it is optimal, but not always possible to avoid extension into the IVC and &quot;jailing&quot; the opposite iliac vein. Stents that cross over the orifice of the contralateral iliac vein may increase risk of contralateral LE thrombosis.
-A robust stent is necessary in the left CIV to relieve the external compression from the R CIA.

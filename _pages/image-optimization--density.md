title: "Image Optimization (Density)"

The key to changing the image density is the mAs
You can use the 30% rule which means that you have to increase the mAs by at least 30% to get a noticeable change in image density
NOTE: Increasing the kVP WILL increase the image density but it also increases the amount of compton scatter. If you are increasing the kVp you are going to get a much larger bang for your buck of density at LOWER energy levels
Note: If you want to adjust the kVp but keep the same image density, use the 15% rule. 
Note: for approximately every 4 cm of thickness on a patient, the mAs needs to be doubled to keep the same density

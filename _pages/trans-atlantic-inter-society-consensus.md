Lesions type A: endovascular is tx of choice
-Single stenosis &lt;/= 10 cm (unilateral/bilateral)
-Single occlusion &lt;/= 5 cm length

Lesion type B: endovascular frequently used but insufficient scientific evidence
-Multiple lesions, each &lt;/= 5 cm in length (stenoses or occlusions)
-Single stenosis or occlusion &lt;/= 15 cm in length, not involving distal popliteal artery.
-Heavily calcified occlusion &lt;/= 5 cm in length
-Single popliteal stenosis
-Single or multiple lesions in the absence of continuous tibial vessels to improve inflow for distal bypass.

title: "Total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR)"
---
Pulmonary veinsreturn blood to right side of the heart via: RA. Coronary sinus. Systemic vein. Type 1 anomaly is the snowman heart: . Large, inverted U-shaped vessel empties into superior vena cava.

Total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR) &#8594; all pulmonary veins connect anomalously to the systemic circulation instead of left atrium
Obligate interatrial right-to-left communication enabling blood to reach the left heart, usually an ASD
Supracardiac (50%) &#8594; return at or above the level of the SVC
Common confluence of PVs drains into the left innominate vein via a vertical vein.
CXR: snowman sign, with dilated vertical vein creating left border.
Cardiac (20%) &#8594; drainage into coronary sinus or right atrium
Infracardiac (20%) &#8594; drainage passes through diaphragm via the esophageal hiatus and drains into the hepatic IVC, hepatic vein, or portal venous system.
Mixed (20%)
Typical appearance of TAPVR is normal-sized heart and pulmonary edema in infant.

Pulmonary veins connect to systemic veins or RA (instead of LA)
*complete L to R shunt - needs RL shunt for viability
**enlarged RA, RV, PA

Supracardiac (50%)
 - connect to L vertical vein, SVC, azygous
Cardiac (30%)
 - connect to RA, coronary sinus, persistent sinus venosus
Infracardiac (20%)
 - most are obstructed
 - portal vein, IVC
 - causes pulmonary edema

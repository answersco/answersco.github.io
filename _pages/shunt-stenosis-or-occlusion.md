title: "Shunt stenosis or occlusion"
---
Shunt occlusion is rare in first 30 days, and may be due to residual stenosis in stent-graft at PV end or hypercoagulability.

Late stenosis or occlusion results in elevation of portal-systemic pressure gradient and recurrent symptoms.
-Stent-graft stenoses are almost always in the hepatic vein when the endograft ends a little short (thus why they should extend slightly into IVC).
-Treated with angioplasty and/or extension placement of an additional stent.

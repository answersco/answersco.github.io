&quot;Head Cheese&quot; - bit of everything!
* Peribronchiloar distribution
- ill-defined ground glass centrilobular nodules
- Subacute = patchy GGO, ill defined centrilobular GGNs, mosaic perfusion, air trapping

- Chronic = &quot;UIP + Air trapping&quot; / MOSAIC LUNG = bronchiectasis and air trapping (mix of everything = GG, consolidation, air trapping, and some normal lung)

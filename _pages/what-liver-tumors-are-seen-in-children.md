title: "What Liver tumors are seen in children &gt; 5 yo and &lt; 5yo?"
---
&gt; 5 yo: only ONE - HCC! (10-15 yo)
- Early liver cirrhosis (usually neonatal biliary atresia) with arterially enhancing liver mass and elevated AFP

* also Undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma = pissed off cousin of mesenchymal hamartoma (cystic + mass; aggressive, separations, ruptures)

&lt; 5 yo: there are 3:

1. Mesenchymal Hamartoma = NORMAL AFP; Cystic lesion in liver of infant; no calcs

2. Infantile hemangnioendothelioma = NORMAL AFP; Solid liver mass with high flow areas
- think of Kasabach Merritt Syndrome if low platelets; high output heart failure

3. Hepatoblastoma = ELEVATED AFP; Solid liver mass with calcs
- Precocious Puberty 2/2 HCG, assoc with Wilms

Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukencephalopathy.

Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)
Inherited disease characterized by recurrent stroke, migraine, subcortical dementia, and pseudobulbar palsy, due to small vessel arteriopathy.
MRI: symmetric foci of T2 prolongation in the subcortical white matter, which may become confluent as disease progresses.
Anterior temporal lobe or paramedian frontal lobe foci are highly sensitive and specific for CADASIL, especially with history of migraine.
Although the symmetric subcortical pattern is similar to PRES, the distribution in CADASIL is anterior circulation.

cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy

Classic history is 40 yo presenting with migraines and eventually dementia 

MRI will show diffuse white matter disease within the frontal lobes and the temporal lobes (occipital lobes usually SPARED)

-cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy

-migraines, dementia
-severe SYMMETRIC white matter disease in frontal and temporal lobes (vs PRES posterior circulation)
-recurrent stroke, TIA

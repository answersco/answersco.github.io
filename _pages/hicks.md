A&amp;A case that tell us act requirement = ANY assistance, but need SPECIFIC intent; conviction here overturned b/c defendant needed specific intent to encourage/abet Rowe to murder Colvard; not about effect&#8212;it's about what the defendant intended to aid and abet, associate himself w/ the venture; mere presence is NOT enough unless he INTENTIONALLY aids in some way or had a prior agreement; specific purpose to help w/ crime is needed (traditional common-law intent, mere knowledge NOT enough)

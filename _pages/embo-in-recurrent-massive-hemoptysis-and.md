title: "Embo in recurrent massive hemoptysis and unique risk for bronchial arteries"
---
Massive hemoptysis = 300 mL of blood in 24 hours

Embo is accepted therapy for recurrent massive hemoptysis that hasn't responded to conservative measures.
RIsk of embo unique to bronchial arteries is potential for spinal cord ischemic even from inadvertent embo of an anterior spinal artery.

Goal of embo of bronchial arteries (or hypertrophied collaterals) in patients with hemoptysis from benign disease: decrease blood supply without infarcting tissue.
-Embo often controls acute episode of bleeding but is rarely definitive.
-Particulate agents between 200 and 700 um should be delivered through a selective catheter (usually microcatheter)
-Glue and Onyx can also be used. Alcohol, ethiodol, and fine powders are contraindicated.
-Coils shouldn't be used in the ostium of the artery because repeat embo may be necessary.

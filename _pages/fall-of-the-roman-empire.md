title: "Fall of the Roman Empire"
---
The fall of this empire was precipitated by Germanic attacks and toward the mid fifth century barbarian chieftains replaced roman emperors. Rome and Western Europe was overrun by the German tribes but they respected the Roman culture and learned from their roman sunjects. Some Roman government and cultural ideas survived and blended with Germanic culture.

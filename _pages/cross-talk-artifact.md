title: "Cross talk artifact"
---
RF and FT pulses not perfectly rectangular -&gt; excitation of neighboring sections -&gt; partial saturation and lower signal of all sections except ones on the end
Fixed by:
- increased gap between sections
- interleaving slices (all odds, then all evens)
- 3D imaging (does not occur with 3D)

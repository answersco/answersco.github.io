1) diaphragm &amp; intercostal muscles contract which enlarges the thorax and decreases intrathoracic pressure
2) pulls lungs outward
3) the pressure within the airways drops and air rushes in

-inhalation
-contract muscles to increase lung volume

1) Thoracic cavity expands, pulling parietal pleurae outward
2) Visceral pleurae and lungs, by virtue of sticking together, follow (pneumothorax if air in there)
3) Pressure lowered in lungs as volume increases

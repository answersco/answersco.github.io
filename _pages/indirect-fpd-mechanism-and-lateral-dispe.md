Indirect FPD:
X-ray activates thallium doped Cesium iodide (CsI) &#8594; emits light&#8594; photodiode turns the light into an electric signal that is read-out.

Lateral dispersion&#8594; light diffuses laterally&#8594; decreases spatial resolution, with worsened effects at increased thickness of crystal 
Using too thin a crystal decreases sensitivity for x-ray absorption
Gadolinium oxysulfide has more lateral dispersion than CsI
Columnar structure&#8594; permits thick crystal with decreased lateral dispersion

Leukoplakia (squamous metaplasia): rare urothelial inflammatory condition 
Not thought to be premalignant when the renal collecting system is involved
Association between bladder leukoplakia and SCC of the bladder
Imaging: flat mass or focal thickening of the renal pelvis or ureteral wall&#8594; may produce characteristic corduroy appearance

Malacoplakia: inflammatory condition associated with chronic UTI (usually e coli), typically in middle-aged women. No malignant potential
Imaging: multiple flat filling defects that characteristically involve the distal ureter

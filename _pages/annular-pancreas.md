Best diagnostic clue
Upper GI showing circumferential narrowing of 2nd portion of duodenum
Ring of pancreatic tissue surrounds the duodenum
Location
Pancreatic head/uncinate process encircling 2nd portion of duodenum

This is a failure of the ventral pancreatic bud to rotate with the duodenum which results in encasement of the duodenum by the pancreas
In kids, this leads to duodenal obstruction
In adults, this leads to pancreatitis

Imaging: you can see the fact that the duodenum is encased by the pancreas

Pancreas encases the duodeunum
